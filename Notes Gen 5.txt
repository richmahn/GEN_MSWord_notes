5:1-32 The Genealogy/Descendants Of Adam Up To Noah 

Gen 5:1 This {is} the written account of the generations of Adam: On the day God created man{kind}, he made him in the likeness of God.

This {is}
“Here {is}” or “What follows {is}”

the written account
“the written {family} record/history” or “the {family} record”

of the generations of Adam:
“of/about Adam and his descendants:” or “of/about Adam’s family-line/genealogy:”

On the day God created man{kind}, he made him 
“On the day {that/when} God created/made human beings, he made them”. See how you translated “created” in Gen 1:1, 27; 2:4, and “man” in Gen 1:26-27.

in the likeness of God.
“in his own likeness.” or “to be like himself.” God created mankind to be like himself in certain ways, not to be exactly like him in every way (Gen 1:26-27).


Gen 5:2 He created them male and female, and he blessed them and called their name “man{kind}” on the day they were created.

He created them male and female,
“He {also} created them {to be} male and female,” See how you translated this clause in Gen 1:27.

and he blessed them
“He blessed them” or “He said/promised that he would make them prosper/flourish”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Also see how you translated “blessed” in Gen 1:22, 28. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.

and called their name
“and called/named them”. See how you translated the phrase “called...name” in Gen 4:17, 25, 26.

“man{kind}”
“human beings”. Be consistent here with how you translated this term in verse one.

on the day they were created.
“on the {same} day {that} they were created {by him}.” or “on the {same} day {that} he created them.” Consider the best way to translate this passive clause in your language. For some languages it is clearer or more natural to put this clause earlier in this verse and say, “and on the {same} day {that} he created them, he blessed them and called/named them human beings.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

Gen 5:3 And Adam lived 130 years, then he fathered {a son} in his own likeness, according to his image, and he called his name Seth.

And Adam lived 130 years, then he fathered {a son}
“When Adam had lived 130 years, he fathered/had {a son}” or “When Adam was 130 years old, he fathered/had {a son}”. Each translation team needs to decide how they are going to write large numbers in the Bible. Many teams use numerals, for example, “130” here in verse 3, especially if the target language has a complicated counting system. Other teams prefer to use words, for example, “one hundred thirty” here. Be consistent in what you do throughout your translation. (See: translate-numbers)

in his own likeness, according to his image,
“who was {a human being} like himself and looked like him,” or “who was like him in many ways,” These two phrases have similar meanings and emphasize that Seth was similar to Adam in many ways. See how you translated similar phrases in Gen 1:26. (See: figs-doublet)

and he called his name Seth.
“and he/Adam named him Seth.” or “Adam named his/that son Seth.” For some languages it is more natural to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language.


Gen 5:4 And the days of Adam after he fathered Seth were 800 years, and he fathered {other} sons and daughters. 

And the days of Adam after he fathered Seth were 
“After he/Adam fathered/had Seth, Adam/he lived” or “After Seth’s birth, Adam lived” or “After Seth was born, Adam lived”

800 years,
“{another} 800 years,” or “800 {more} years,” For some languages, it may be more natural to change the clause order of this sentence and say, “Adam lived 800 {more} years after Seth was born,...” Do what is best in your language throughout this chapter. (See: figs-infostructure)


and he fathered {other} sons and daughters.
“He {also} fathered/had {other} sons and daughters.” or ”He was {also} the father of {other} sons and daughters.” This clause probably refers to all the other children that Adam had, including those who were born before and after Seth was born. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.


Gen 5:5 So all the days of Adam that he lived were 930 years, and he died.

So all the days of Adam that he lived were 930 years,
“So Adam lived a total of 930 years,” or “All together Adam lived 930 years,” Make sure that the name “Adam” is spelled consistently in your translation of verses 1, 3-5. (See: translate-names)

and he died.
“and {then} he died.” or “before he died.”

Gen 5:6 And Seth lived 105 years, then he fathered Enosh. 

And Seth lived 105 years, then
“When/After Seth had lived 105 years,” or “When/After Seth was 105 years old,” The events in verse 6 happened before Adam died (verse 5). So if you use a conjunction here, make sure your translation does not sound like verse 6 happened after Adam died. (See: grammar-connect-time-background)

he fathered Enosh.
“he fathered/had {a son named} Enosh.” or “he fathered/had {a son he/they named} Enosh.” or “he fathered/had {a son whose name was} Enosh.” You could make it explicit in your translation or in a footnote that Enosh was a son. The same thing is true for the rest of the children who were born in this chapter (who were all sons). (See: figs-explicit)


Gen 5:7 Then after he fathered Enosh, Seth lived 807 years, and he fathered {other} sons and daughters. 

Then after he fathered Enosh, Seth lived
“After he/Seth had Enosh, Seth/he lived” or “After Enosh’s birth, Seth lived” or “After Enosh was born, Seth lived”. In fact, throughout chapter 5, make sure it is clear in your translation whom each pronoun refers to. (See: writing-pronouns)

807 years,
“{another} 807 years,” or “807 {more} years,”

and he fathered {other} sons and daughters.
 “He {also} fathered/had {other} sons and daughters.” or “He was {also} the father of {other} sons and daughters.” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. See how you translated this clause in verse 4.


Gen 5:8 So all the days of Seth were 912 years, and he died.

So all the days of Seth were 912 years,
“So Seth lived a total of 912 years,” or “All together Seth lived 912 years,” Be consistent with how you spell the name “Seth” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 4:25-26; 5:3-4, 6-8. (See: translate-names)

Then after he fathered Kenan, Enosh lived
“After he/Enosh had Kenan, Enosh/he lived” or “After Kenan’s birth, Enosh lived” or “After Kenan was born, Enosh lived”. See how you translated a similar sentence in verse 7, and see the notes about that there. (See: writing-pronouns)
