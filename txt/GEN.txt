1:1-2:3 How God Created Everything

Gen 1:1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

In the beginning
“At the beginning {of time/everything}” or “{Everything} began when”. Many Bible scholars think that verse one records God’s first act in creating the universe. This is also the traditional, historically-held view and fits with the narrative structure of the Hebrew text, as well as the wider context of Scriptures which states that God created everything out of nothing at the very beginning of the world (Psalm 33:6, 9; Hebrews 11:3). See the chapter introduction for more details about different interpretations of Genesis 1:1. Also, some languages must use a verb (“began”) in verse 1 rather than a noun (“beginning”). Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-abstractnouns)

God
Translate the title “God” in a way that refers to the Supreme Being who created everything, who has complete power, who knows everything and is present everywhere. He is the only true God and has always existed. (See: translate-key-terms)

created
“made”. In the Hebrew Bible, the verb “create” refers to an activity that only God does, and it often implies (as it does here) that he made something out of nothing. Also, the forms of the verbs in the Hebrew text (and the conjunctions) show that chapter one is a narrative that tells about true history and events in the order that things actually happened. Make sure that your translation does the same thing. (See: translate-key-terms)

the heavens
“the sky”. This phrase refers here to the region where all the stars and planets would later exist. Keep that in mind as you translate this term. (See: translate-key-terms)

and the earth.
This phrase refers to the planet earth. (See: translate-key-terms)


Gen 1:2 Now the earth was formless and empty, and darkness {was} over the surface of the deep {waters}, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters. 

Now the earth
“Now {at first after that,} the earth” or “{At first after that,} the earth”. The author pauses here to describe what the earth was like after God first created it (verse 1). Some languages use a conjunction like “Now” to introduce that information; other languages do not use a conjunction here. Do what is natural in your language. Also, be consistent here with how you translated “the earth” in verse 1.

was formless and empty,
It is not clear what the earth looked like at that time, but it did not have its present shape and order. Also, the Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) “was formless/shapeless and empty/desolate,” or “did not have {its present} form, and there was nothing {living} on it {yet},” (2) “completely empty/desolate,” which is a hendiadys. However it is best to keep both terms separate in your translation (as in the first interpretation). 

and darkness {was} over the surface of the deep {waters},
“It was {totally/completely} dark, there was deep {water} {everywhere},” or “There was deep {water} {everywhere} {that was covered/surrounded} in/by {complete/total} darkness,” For some languages it is more natural to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language.

and the Spirit of God was hovering
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) “and God’s Spirit was hovering/moving” (2) “and a wind from God was blowing” (3) “and a powerful wind was blowing”. The first interpretation is most likely, since the Hebrew verb “hovering” does not describe what wind does.

over the surface of the waters.
“over the surface of the water.” or “above the waters/water.” Throughout this chapter, the word “waters” is in the plural in the Hebrew text. For some languages it is more natural to use the singular “water”. Do what is best in your language in each context.


Gen 1:3 Then God said, “Let there be light.” And there was light.

Then God said,	
“Then God commanded,” What God says in verse 3 is a command. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to make that explicit in this quote margin. (See: writing-quotations)

“Let there be light.”
“Let light exist.” or “I command there to be light.” or “I command light to start shining!” This is a command, not permission or a suggestion. It is a direct quote of what God actually said, and it is usually put between quotation marks in a translation. If you use an exclamation mark with this command in your translation, make sure it does not mean or imply that God was angry. Also, the way you translate “light” should refer to what shines from a source of light; it does not refer here to the source itself.

And there was light.
“And/So {immediately} there was light.” or “And {so/immediately} light started shining.” Light began to shine immediately as a result of God’s command.


Gen 1:4 And God saw the light, that {it was} good. Then God separated between the light and the darkness.

And God saw
“And he saw/observed” or “God/He saw/observed”. Notice that Hebrew frequently uses a conjunction such as “And” or “Then” at the beginning of a sentence. Some languages do not use conjunctions as frequently as Hebrew does. Do what is accurate and natural in your language in each context. (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)

the light, that {it was} good.
“that the light {was} good/excellent.” In the Bible, “good” is an important theme. Throughout chapter one, it especially means that what God created was high quality, complete, and had no defects; in other words, it had all the characteristics and functions that God intended it to have. It also includes the idea that what God created was untainted by sin and reflected his good character (Psalm 19:1; Romans 1:20). The focus here is not on how pleased or satisfied God was. (See: translate-key-terms)

Then God
“Then he”. In order to produce an accurate and natural translation, it is important in each context to make sure that nouns (such as “God”) and pronouns (such as “he”) are used properly in your language. In the Hebrew text, “God” is repeated frequently in chapter one to emphasize him and show that he is in focus. For some languages it is more natural to say “God” only once at the beginning of each paragraph or section, and then use pronouns to refer to him the rest of the time (or most of the time). Throughout chapter one, do what is best in your language each time that God is referred to. (See: writing-pronouns)

separated between the light and the darkness.
“separated/divided the light from the darkness {so that each had its own time}.” or “caused the light to have its own time and the darkness to have its own time.” or “separated the light from the darkness {so that it would be light for a number of hours, and then dark for a number of hours}.”

   
Gen 1:5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. Then there was evening, and there was morning, one day.

And God called
“Then God/he called/named” or “God/He called/named”. Some languages omit the connecting word “And” or “Then” here. Consider the best way in your language to connect this sentence with the previous one. (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)

the light Day,
“the light Daytime.” Notice that in this context the word “Day” refers only to the time when the sun is shining, not to the 24-hour time period that makes up a complete day. Make sure that this is clear in your translation. Throughout chapter one, some translations use quote marks around the names that God gives the different things he created.

and the darkness he called Night.
“and the darkness he called/named Nighttime.” or “and he called/named the darkness Nighttime.” In the Hebrew text, “the darkness” is first in this clause to emphasize the contrast between the light and the darkness. Consider the best way to translate this clause in your language.

Then there was evening, and there was morning,
“Then evening came and {then/later} morning came,” The evening and the morning are the parts of a 24-hour day that separate the hours of daytime (light) from the hours of nighttime (darkness): Evening came at the end of each daytime after God finished his work of creating. Then after about 12 hours of nighttime, morning came, which began the next 12 hours of daytime when God did more work. Make sure your translation does not sound like morning came immediately after evening. Some languages have a one-word conjunction that means “and then” or “and later” that fits well here. (See: grammar-connect-time-sequential)
   
one day.
“{and that was} day one.” or “{and that was} {the end of} the first day.” Here “day” refers to a full 24-hour day. Also, the Hebrew text uses a cardinal number (“one”) here, but then uses ordinal numbers (“second”, “third”, and so on) for the rest of the days of creation week. Some languages need to use an ordinal number (“first”) here too. Other languages use cardinal numbers throughout (“day one”, “day two”, and so on). Do what is best in your language. (See: translate-ordinal)

Gen 1:6 Then God said, “Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.”

Then God said,
“Then God commanded,” See how you translated this phrase in verse 3. (See: writing-quotations)
   
“Let there be an expanse
“Let there be a large/vast space” or “I command there to be a {large/vast} expanse/space” or “I command a large/vast space to form/exist”. The Hebrew word for “expanse” here describes a large space that is “spread out.” It was not solid, rather it was open and empty and could be seen through and flown through (verse 20). It was probably also curved, following the spherical shape of the earth. See how you translated “Let there be” in verse 3.

in the middle of the waters,
“in the middle of the water,” See how you translated “waters” in verse 2.
   
and let it separate the waters from the waters.”
“and let it separate/divide the water {above it} from the water {below it}.” or “so that it separates/divides the waters/water into two separate/different places.”


Gen 1:7 So God made the expanse and separated between the waters that {were} under the expanse and the waters that {were} above the expanse. And it was so.

So God made
“In that way God/he made/created” or “That is how God/he made/created”. Verse 7 explains what God’s command in verse 6 caused to happen, and it repeats some of the same words and phrases. Make sure that your translation of these verses does not sound like God created the expanse twice.

the expanse 
“a large/vast space”

and separated
“and divided” or “and used it to separate/divide”

between the waters that {were} under the expanse and the waters that {were} above the expanse.
“the water that {was} below the expanse/space from the water that {was} above it.” or “the water that {was} under/below it from the water that {was} above it.” For some languages it is more natural to use a pronoun (“it”) here to refer to the expanse, since it was just mentioned earlier in the verse. Each language has its own system of when to use nouns or pronouns to refer to people, places and things. In each context, do what is clear and natural in your language. (See: writing-pronouns)

And it was so.
“That is the way it happened.” or “Everything was/happened {exactly} as he commanded {it to be/happen}.” (See: figs-explicit)


Gen 1:8 And God called the expanse Heavens. Then there was evening, and there was morning, the second day. 

And God called
“and God/he called/named” or “God/He called/named”. Consider whether it is more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here (with or without a conjunction), or to continue the sentence that began at the end of verse 7. Also see how you translated this phrase in verse 5. (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)

the expanse
“the large/vast space”. See how you translated this phrase in verses 6 and 7.
   
Heavens.
“Sky.” This word probably refers here to the atmosphere above the earth’s surface where clouds are and where birds fly, as well as the space where the sun, moon, and stars are now. See how you translated this term in verse 1. (See: translate-key-terms)

Then there was evening, and there was morning,
“Then evening came and {then/later} morning came,” See how you translated this sentence in verse 5, and see the note about that there.
   
the second day.
“{and that was} {the end of} the second day.” or “{and} the second day ended.” or “{and that was} {the end of} day two.” Consider whether it is more natural in your language to use an ordinal number (“second”) here or a cardinal number (“two”). (See: translate-ordinal)

__________________________Paragraph Break________________________________

Gen 1:9 Then God said, “Let the waters under the heavens be gathered to one place, and let the dry ground appear.” And it was so.
   
Then God said,
“Then God commanded,” See how you translated this phrase in verses 3 and 6. (See: writing-quotations)

“Let the waters under the heavens be gathered
“Let the water {that is} under the heavens/sky gather/come together” or “I command the water {that is} below the heavens/sky to gather/come together”. Consider whether it is better here in your language to use a passive form of the verb (“be gathered”) or an active form (“gather” or “come”). (See: figs-activepassive)

to one place,
“in one place/area” or “into one area”

and let the dry ground appear.”
“so that there is dry ground/land.” or “so that dry ground/land can be seen.” or “so that land is uncovered and dries off.” The water had been covering the land, so when the water receded from it, the land became exposed and dried off. Make sure that the way you translate “dry ground” does not sound like the land was dry while it was under the water.
   
And it was so.
“And that is {exactly} what happened.” or “And it was/happened {exactly} as God commanded {it to be/happen}.” See how you translated this sentence in verse 7. It may be necessary to translate it in different ways, depending on the context.
   

Gen 1:10 And God called the dry ground Land, and the gathered waters he called Seas. And God saw that {it was} good.

And God called 
“Then God/he called/named”

the dry ground
“the dry land” or “the ground/land that had dried off”

Land,
“Ground,” This is the same Hebrew word that is translated as “earth” in verse 1, but here it refers to the dry land or ground (in contrast to the water), not the entire planet.

and the gathered waters he called
“and the waters/water that he had gathered together he called/named” or “and he called/named the gathered waters” or “and he called/named the waters/water that had gathered/come together”. See how you translated a sentence in verse 5 that is similar in structure to this sentence. (See: figs-infostructure)

Seas.
“Oceans.” or “Sea/Ocean.” At that time there was probably just one very large body of water and one very large land mass on the earth (as verse 9 indicates). So a singular noun that refers to the largest body of water, such as “Ocean” or “Sea”, could be used here in your translation.

And God saw 
“And he saw/observed” or “God/He saw/observed”. Decide whether it is more natural in your language to use a noun (“God”) or a pronoun (“he”) in this context. See how you translated this phrase in verse 4. (See: writing-pronouns)

that {it was} good.
“that {what he had made was} good/excellent.” or “that {the land and the seas/ocean were} good/excellent.” Some languages cannot use a pronoun (“it”) here, but have to specify what was good. Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated the word “good” in verse 4, and see the note about that there.

Gen 1:11 Then God said, “Let the land sprout vegetation: {every} plant yielding seed, {every} fruit tree bearing fruit according to its kind, that {has} its seed inside it, on the earth.” And it was so.

Then God said,
“Then God commanded,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Let the land
“I command the land/ground to” or “The land/ground must now”. Notice that when God commands the land to do something, it obeys him. See how you translated “Land” in verse 10.

sprout vegetation:
“grow/produce {green} plants,” or “be covered with {green} plants,” The Hebrew word for “vegetation” refers generally here to any kind of green plant and includes the plants and trees that are mentioned next in this verse.

{every} plant yielding seed,
“{including} {every kind/type of} plant that produces/has seeds” or “{including} {all kinds/types of} plants that produce/have seeds”. This phrase refers to many different kinds of plants, not just one plant or one seed. Make sure that is clear in your translation. Also, these kinds of plants have soft stems and include vegetable plants, herbs and other plants that produce edible seeds, such as rice, corn and wheat.

{every} fruit tree bearing fruit according to its kind,
“{and} fruit trees that bear/produce fruit, {each} according to its {own} kind/type,” or “{and} {every kind/type of} fruit tree that bears/produces/has its own kind/type of fruit” or “{and} {all kinds/types of} fruit trees that bear/produce/have their own kind/type of fruit”. The phrase “according to its kind” emphasizes that each different kind of tree produces its own kind of fruit and seeds, which grow and become only that kind of tree. For example, apple trees always produce apples with apple seeds, never peaches or cherries, or any other kind of fruit or seeds.

that {has} its seed inside it,
“that {has} seeds inside,” or “with seeds inside,” or “with its {own kind/type of} seeds inside it,” 

on the earth.”
“throughout the earth.” or “all over the earth.” For some languages it is clearer and more natural to put this phrase earlier in this verse and say, “Let the land sprout vegetation on/throughout the earth...” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

And it was so.
“And that is {exactly} what happened:” or “And it/everything happened {exactly} as God commanded {it to happen}:” Either a period or a colon can be used here, but a colon more clearly shows that verse 12 gives the details of what happened. This is different from verse 7 where the details of what happened come before “And it was so”, and from verse 9 where no additional details are given.


Gen 1:12 So the land brought out vegetation: {every} plant yielding seed according to its kind, and {every} tree bearing fruit that {has} its seed inside it, according to its kind. And God saw that {it was} good.

So the land brought out vegetation:
“The land sprouted/produced vegetation/plants,” or “The land started growing/producing {green} plants,” Verse 12 explains what God’s command in verse 11 caused to happen, and it repeats some of the same words and phrases. Make sure that your translation of these verses does not sound like God created the plants twice.
	
{every} plant yielding seed according to its kind,
“{including} plants that produce/have seeds, {each} according to its {own} kind/type,” or “{including} {every kind/type of} plant that produces/has seeds that grow into the same kind/type of plant,” or “{including} {all kinds/types of} plants that produce/have their own kind/type of seeds,”

and {every} tree bearing fruit that {has} its seed inside it, according to its kind.
“and trees that bear/produce fruit with seeds inside, {each} according to its {own} kind.” or “and {every kind/type of} tree that produces/has fruit with seeds that grow into the same kind/type of tree.” or “and {all kinds/types of} trees that {produce/have} their own kind/type of seed-bearing fruit.”

And God saw
“And he saw/observed” or “God/He saw/observed”. Consider whether or not it is more natural in your language to begin this sentence with a conjunction. (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)

that {it was} good.
“that {what he had made/created was} good/excellent.” or “that {all the plants and trees were} good/excellent.” See how you translated this clause in verse 10. Some languages have to specify what was good. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-explicit)


Gen 1:13 Then there was evening, and there was morning, the third day.
 
Then there was evening, and there was morning,
“Then evening came and {then/later} morning came,” See how you translated this sentence in verses 5 and 8.

the third day.
“{and that was} {the end of} the third day.” or “{and} the third day {ended}.” or “{and that was} {the end of} day three.” (See: translate-ordinal)

Gen 1:14 Then God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate between the day and the night. And let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years.

Then God said, 
“Then God commanded,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Let there be lights 
“Let lights/lamps appear/exist” or “I command there to be sources of light” or “Let there be things/objects that give/shine light”. These lights refer to the sun, moon and stars that give off light. But it is important to keep this general in your translation (like the Hebrew text does) and not specify the names of these lights.

in the expanse of the heavens
“in the expanse/space of/called the heavens/sky” or “in the open space of the heavens/sky” or “in the heavens/sky”. The expanse is the same thing as the heavens (verse 8), so some translations leave “the expanse of” implied here. Do what is best in your language. 

to separate
“to divide/distinguish” or “that separate/divide”

between the day and the night.
“the day{time} from the night{time}.” See how you translated “Day{time}” and “Night{time}” in verse 5.

And let them be for 
“Let those lights/lamps also be” or “They must/will also serve/function as” or “I also command those lights/lamps to serve/function as” 

signs, and for 
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) “signs/markers {of special/important events}, and {they must/will} mark” or “mark/indicate when important things happen, and {they must/will} mark” (2) “signs/markers that mark/indicate/show”. The word “signs” means that the lights can mark certain times of the year. Following the first interpretation, the lights are to also mark special events (such as the star that signaled Jesus’ birth and the darkened sun at Jesus’ death). 

seasons, and for days and years.
“seasons, days and years.” or “when seasons, days and years begin {and end}.” The sun and moon show the passing of time. For example, the 30-day month is determined by the phases of the moon, and the 365-day year is determined by the time it takes for the earth to travel around the sun. Seasons are regular times of the year, such as seed-planting and harvesting times, and the seasons of spring, summer, fall and winter (Genesis 8:22), as well as the special festivals which God appointed for his people to meet with him. You could put some of that information in a footnote.
   

Gen 1:15 And let them be as lights in the expanse of the heavens to shine on the earth.” And it was so.

And let them be as
“And they must/will be” or “They must/will serve/function as” or “Their purpose is to serve/function as”

lights
“sources of light”
   
in the expanse of the heavens
“in the expanse/space called the heavens/sky” or “in the open space of the heavens/sky” or “in the heavens/sky”. See how you translated this phrase in verse 14.

to shine on the earth.”
“to/that shine {light} on the earth.” or “so that they provide/give light to/for the earth.” See how you translated “the earth” in verses 1-2.
   
And it was so.
“And that is {exactly} what happened.” or “And it was/happened {exactly} as he commanded {it to be/happen}.”


Gen 1:16 So God made the two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night, and the stars.

So God made
“In that way God/he made/created” or “That is how God/he made/created”. Verses 16-18 explain what God’s commands in verses 14-15 caused to happen. Make sure your translation of these verses does not sound like he created the lights twice. See how you translated “So God made” in verse 7.
   
the two great lights,
“the two bright/big lights,” This phrase refers to the sun and the moon, which are the two brightest objects in the earth’s sky. However the author intentionally does not use their names, so you should not include their names in your translation either.

the greater light 
“the stronger/brighter light”. The focus is on the relative brightness or strength of the lights, not on their size.

to rule the day, 
“to dominate/govern the day,” or “to shine during the day,” The word “rule” is a figure of speech that means each light has the greatest effect during a particular time period because it is the brightest light that is shining then. For some languages, nonliving objects like the sun and the moon cannot “rule” because only people can do that. Do what is accurate and natural in your language. (See: figs-personification)

and the lesser light 
“and the weaker/dimmer light”

to rule the night,
“to dominate/govern the night,” or “to shine during the night,” Be consistent here with how you translated “rule” previously in this verse.

and the stars.
“and {he also made/created} the stars.” or “{That is} also {when he made/created} the stars.” The verb “made” that is used earlier in the verse is implied here. Translate this in a way that is clear and natural in your language. (See: figs-ellipsis)


Gen 1:17 And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to shine on the earth,

And God 
“God/He”. Consider the best way in your language to refer to God in this context. (See: writing-pronouns)

set them
“placed/put them” or “placed/put the lights”. Consider the best way in your language to refer to the lights in this context. (See: writing-pronouns)

in the expanse of the heavens
“in the expanse/space called the heavens/sky” or “in the open space of the heavens/sky” or “in the heavens/sky”. See how you translated this phrase in verses 14 and 15. 

to shine on the earth,
“to shine light on the earth,” or “to provide/give light to/for the earth,” See how you translated this phrase in verse 15.


Gen 1:18 and to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate between the light and the darkness. And God saw that {it was} good.

and to rule over the day and over the night,
“and to govern/dominate the day{time} and/or the night{time},” or “and to shine during the day{time} and/or during the night{time},” Make sure that your translation of the word “day” refers here to the daytime hours, not an entire 24-hour day. Also see how you translated “rule” in 1:16. (See: figs-personification)

and to separate between the light and the darkness.
“and to divide/distinguish the light from the darkness.” or “and to separate/distinguish the time of light from the time of darkness.” Consider again how you translated “separate” in verses 4, 6-7, 14 and 18.

And God saw 
“And he saw/observed” or “God/He saw/observed”

that {it was} good.
“that {what he had made/created was} good/excellent.” or “that {the lights in the heavens/sky were} good/excellent.” Some languages need to specify what was good. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-explicit)


Gen 1:19 Then there was evening, and there was morning, the fourth day.

Then there was evening, and there was morning,
“Then evening came and {then/later} morning came,”

Gen 1:20 Then God said, “Let the waters swarm {with} swarm{s} of living creature{s}, and let bird{s} fly above the earth across the face of the expanse of the sky.”

Then God said,
“Then God commanded,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Let the waters swarm {with} swarm{s} of living creature{s},
“I command the water to be full of large numbers/groups of living creatures,” or “I command there to be large numbers/groups of {water} animals that live everywhere in the water,” 

and let bird{s} fly
“and let there be birds that fly” or “I also command there to be birds that fly” or “Also let there be winged creatures that fly”. The Hebrew word for “birds” can also be more general and refer to “winged/flying creatures,” which includes birds, bats, flying insects and even flying reptiles that are now extinct. Consider whether it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

above the earth across the face of the expanse of the sky.”
“above the earth, through the sky/air.” or “across/in/through the sky above the earth.”


Gen 1:21 So God created the great sea creatures and every living creature that moves which the waters swarm with according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that {it was} good.

So God created
“That is how God/he created/made” or “In that way God/he created/made”. See how you translated “created” in verse 1. (See: writing-pronouns)

the great sea creatures
“the huge/gigantic sea/ocean animals”. These include whales, sharks, giant squid, crocodiles, and leviathans (Psalm 74:13-14, Isaiah 27:1), which were probably swimming reptiles that are now extinct.
 
and every living creature that moves
“and every {kind/type of fish and every other} creature/animal that moves/lives” or “and all the {fish and other} {kinds/types of} creatures/animals that move/live”

which the waters swarm with
“throughout the water/ocean in large numbers/groups,” or “in the water and fills it,” or “all over the place in the water/ocean,”

according to their kind,
“{each} according to its {own} kind/type,” or “{each} that produces/has its own kind/type {of offspring/young},” This phrase emphasizes that each different kind of creature has its own distinct kind of offspring/young. For example, whales always give birth to whales, and never give birth to cats or cows, or any other kind of creature.

and
“and {how he created/made}” or “{That is} also {how he created/made}”. For some languages it is more natural to begin a new sentence here, so that the previous sentence is not too long. Do what is best in your language.

every winged bird
“every {kind/type of} bird” or “all {the different kinds/types of} birds” or “every {kind/type of} winged creature”. See how you translated “birds” in verse 20.

according to its kind.
“{each} according to its {own} kind/type.” or “{each} that produces/has its own kind/type {of young}.” See how you translated this phrase earlier in this verse.

And God saw 
“And He saw/observed” or “God/He saw/observed”

that {it was} good.
“that {what he had created/made was} good/excellent.” or “that {the water animals and the birds were} good/excellent.” Some languages need to specify what was good. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-explicit)


Gen 1:22 Then God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let the bird{s} multiply on the earth.”

Then God blessed them,
“Then God caused them {all} to prosper/flourish” or “Then God blessed the water creatures/animals and the birds”. For some languages it is necessary to specify who “them” refers to. Do what is best in your language. (See: writing-pronouns)

saying,
“by saying {to them},” or “and said {first to the water animals},” God blesses the water animals first. If that is not clear, you could make that explicit here in the quote margin or at the beginning of what God says. (See: figs-explicit)
   
“Be fruitful 
“Reproduce” or “You water animals must/will produce/have many babies/young”. God speaks directly to the water animals using the second person (“you”), then later in the verse speaks about the birds in the third person (“the birds”). For some languages it is necessary to use either second person for both or third person for both, to prevent confusion. Do what is natural and clear in your language. (See: figs-123person)

and multiply
“so that you {and your offspring/descendants} {will} multiply/increase {greatly} {in number}” or “so that you {and your offspring/descendants} {will} become {very} numerous/many” (See: grammar-connect-logic-goal)
   
and fill
“and live all over the place in” or “and live throughout”

the waters in the seas,
“the water in/of the sea/ocean” or “the ocean/water”. For some languages, “water in the seas” is too repetitive, so it is more natural here to just say “seas/sea” or “ocean” or “water”. Do what is best in your language.
   
and let the bird{s}
“And the birds must/will {also}” or “{You} birds must/will {also}”. Consider whether it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
   
multiply
“increase {greatly} in number” or “become {very} numerous/many”. See how you translated “multiply” earlier in this verse.

“throughout the earth.” or “{and live} all over the earth.”


Gen 1:23 Then there was evening, and there was morning, the fifth day.

Then there was evening, and there was morning, 
“Then evening came and {then/later} morning came,”

the fifth day.
“{and that was} {the end of} the fifth day.” or “and the fifth day ended.”
 or “{and that was} {the end of} day five.” (See: translate-ordinal) 

__________________________Paragraph Break________________________________

Gen 1:24 Then God said, “Let the land bring forth {every} living creature according to its kind: livestock and {every} crawling creature and {every} living thing of the earth, {each} according to its kind.” And it was so.

Then God said,
“Then God commanded,”

“Let the land
“I command the land/ground to” or “The land/ground must now”. See how you translated a similar command to the land in verse 11.

bring forth
“produce/yield”
   
{every} living creature
“{every kind/type of} living creature/animal” or “{all kinds/types of} creatures/animals,” This is a general term that refers to all the different kinds of creatures/animals that breathe, including the three large categories of animals mentioned below in this verse.

according to its kind:
“{each} that bears/has its own kind/type of offspring/young,” or “{each} bearing/having its own kind/type of offspring/young,” This phrase means that every kind of animal that God created always produces young that are the same kind of animal as their parents. See how you translated this phrase in verse 21, and see the note about that there.

livestock
“{including} domestic/farm/tame animals,” This term probably includes animals such as horses, camels, cattle, sheep and goats that people raise for food or use for farming or other work. This is in contrast to animals that normally live in the wild.

and {every} crawling creature
“{every} {kind/type of} creature/animal that crawls” or “{all kinds/types of} creatures/animals that crawl”

and {every} living thing of the earth,
“and {every} {other} {kind/type of} {wild/untamed} creature/animal {that lives} on the earth/land,” or “and {all} the {other} {kinds/types of} {wild/untamed} animals {that live} on the earth/land,” This phrase refers in general to animals that are normally not raised by people, but live in the wild.

{each} according to its kind.”
“{each} that bears/has its own kind/type of offspring/young.” or “{each} having its own kind/type of offspring/young.” See how you translated this phrase earlier in this verse.

And it was so.
“And that is {exactly} what happened.” or “It/Everything happened {exactly} as he commanded {it to happen}.”


Gen 1:25 So God made {every} creature of the earth according to its kind, and the livestock according to its kind, and every crawling creature of the ground according to its kind. And God saw that {it was} good.

So God made
“That is how God made/created” or “In that way God made/created”

{every} creature of the earth 
“{every kind/type of} wild/untamed creature/animal,” or “{all the different kinds/types of} wild/untamed creatures/animals,” See how you translated “{every} creature of the earth” in verse 24.

according to its kind,
“{each} that bears/has its own kind/type of offspring/young,” or “{each} having its own kind/type of offspring/young,”

and the livestock 
“and {every kind/type of} domestic/farm/tame animal,” or “and {all} the domestic/farm/tame animals,” See how you translated “livestock” in verse 24.

according to its kind,
“{each} that bears/has its {own} kind/type of offspring/young,” or “{each} having its {own} kind/type of offspring/young,”

and every crawling creature of the ground
“and every {kind/type of} creature/animal that crawls on/along the ground,” or “and all {different kinds/types of} creatures/animals that crawl on/along the ground,” See how you translated “crawling creature” in verse 24.

according to its kind.
“{each} that bears/has its own kind/type of offspring/young.” or “{each} having its {own} kind/type of offspring/young,” Consider again how you translated this phrase in verses 11, 12, 21, 24 and 25. It may be necessary to translate this phrase in different ways, depending on the context.

And God saw
“And he saw/observed” or “God/He saw/observed” 

that {it was} good.
“that {what he had made/created was} good/excellent.” or “that {all the creatures/animals that he had made/created were} good/excellent.” Some languages need to specify what was good. Consider again how you translated “And God saw that...good” in verses 10, 12, 18, 21, 25. (See: figs-explicit)

__________________________Paragraph Break________________________________

Gen 1:26 Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the bird{s} of the sky and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every moving creature moving on the earth.” 

Then God said,
“Then God said {to himself},” Here God is not commanding anything to happen, but is getting ready to personally create mankind himself (the details are given in Gen 2:7, 21-22). Some languages have to specify who is being spoken to. Do what is best in your language. (See: writing-quotations)

“Let us make
“{Now} we should/will make/create”. Most Bible scholars think that the plural pronouns (“us”, “our”) in this verse refer to God and reflect the fact that he is three Persons in one God. So it is best to keep these pronouns plural in your translation. Also, many translations capitalize the first letter of all pronouns that refer to God in order to show him honor and respect. Your translation team needs to decide whether or not you will do that, too. Be consistent with your decision as you translate the Bible.

man
“mankind/humankind” or “human beings”. The Hebrew word for “man” is used here (and in verse 27) as a collective noun that refers to human beings in general, including male and female.

in our image, according to our likeness,
“to be like us and act like us,” or “to be like us, so that they are similar to us in many ways,” These two phrases have similar meanings and emphasize that God made mankind to be like himself in many ways. (See: figs-doublet)

and let them rule over
“and let us put them in charge of” or “We will give them authority to rule/oversee/manage”

the fish of the sea 
“the fish of/in the sea/ocean,”

and over the bird{s} of the sky
“the birds {that fly} in the sky/air,” Some translations leave out the phrase “of the sky” because it is strongly implied and may not sound natural in their languages. However, if it is natural in your language, it is best to include this phrase, because the author repeatedly contrasts three large categories of animals in this section: creatures that live on the ground, creatures that swim in the water, and creatures that fly in the sky. 

and over the livestock
“the domestic/farm/tame animals,” Consider again how you translated “livestock” in verses 24-26.

and over all the earth
“and the entire earth,” This refers to the planet earth and everything on it, including water, soil, metals, minerals and other resources, as well as all the plants and animals.

and over every moving creature moving on the earth.”
“including every creature/animal that moves/lives on the earth.” or “and/including all the creatures/animals that move/live on the earth.” For some languages it is not natural to repeat “and” or “over” with each item in this list. Consider the best way to translate a list like this in your language.


Gen 1:27 Then God created man in his image. In the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.

Then God created
“So God created/made”. In this verse God does what he said he was going to do (verse 26). Make sure your translation does not sound like God created mankind twice. Also see how you translated “created” in verses 1 and 21. (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)
   
man
“mankind/humankind” or “human beings”. Be consistent here with how you translated this term in verse 26. (See: translate-key-terms)
   
in his image. 
“in his own image.” or “to be like himself.” or “to be similar to himself {in many ways}.” God made mankind to be like himself in some ways (not all ways) and to represent him in the world and show people what he is like. For example, God gave human beings an eternal spirit and the ability to have a relationship with him. He also gave us emotions, an understanding of right and wrong, and the ability to reason and make choices, to create new things and to have authority over the rest of creation. You could include some of that information in a footnote.
   
In the image of God he created him;
“{Yes/Indeed,} he created/made them in his image” or “{Indeed} God/he created/made them to be like himself” or “{Yes,} God/he created/made them to be similar to himself {in many ways}”. The pronoun “him” refers to the collective noun “man”, which in this case refers to human beings in general, not just one person. Also, this clause is the second half of a chiasm (an inverted parallelism) that repeats the first part of verse 27 in reverse order, to emphasize that it was in God’s image that human beings were created. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-parallelism)

male and female he created them. 
“He {also} created/made them {to be} male or female.” The phrase “male and female” comes first in the Hebrew text in order to emphasize it. Do what is accurate and natural in your language. Also make sure your translation of this verse does not sound like God is both male and female. (See: figs-figs-infostructure)

__________________________Paragraph Break________________________________

Gen 1:28 Then God blessed them, and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it. And rule over the fish of the sea and over the bird{s} of the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth.” 

Then God blessed them 
“Then God showed his favor to them” or “Then God caused them to prosper/flourish”. See how you translated “blessed” in verse 22.
   
and God said to them,
“and said,” or “by saying to them,” or “by saying,” or “He said,” Make sure it is clear in your translation of this quote margin that what God says next is the way that he blessed mankind, not something he said separately from that. (See: writing-quotations)
   
“Be fruitful 
“Bear/Have many children” or “You will bear/have many children”. See how you translated “Be fruitful and multiply” in verse 22. It may be necessary to translate the phrase in different ways, depending on the context.

and multiply,
“so that you {and your descendants} {will} multiply/increase {greatly} {in number}” or “so that you {and your descendants} {will} become {very} numerous/many” (See: grammar-connect-logic-goal)

and fill the earth
“and live all over the earth” or “and inhabit the whole earth” or “Fill the earth”. For some languages, it is more natural to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language.
   
and subdue it.
“and take control/care of it.” or “and bring it under your control.” 
   
And rule over
“You must rule over” or “You are in charge of” or “I am giving you authority to rule/oversee/manage”. See how you translated “rule” in verse 26.

the fish of the sea and over the bird{s} of the sky
“the fish in the ocean, the birds {that fly} in the sky/air,” See how you translated these phrases in verse 26.
   
and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”
“and every creature/animal that moves/lives on the earth/land.” or “and all the creatures/animals that move/live on the earth/land.” This phrase refers generally here to every kind of creature that lives on land.


Gen 1:29 Then God said, “Behold, I have given to you every plant {that} yields seed that is on the surface of the whole earth and every tree that {has} tree fruit {that} yields seed inside it. They will be yours for food.

Then God said,
“Then God/he {also} said {to them},” or “Then God/he continued/added,” God is still speaking to the human beings, so it may be necessary to add “also” to this quote margin. Some languages need to specify who is being spoken to. Other languages may leave this quote margin implied, since the same subject (God) is talking to the same people. However the repeated quote margin in the Hebrew text could show that God paused before continuing or that he is changing the topic, or to emphasize what he says next. So if it is natural to keep the quote margin here in your language, that is best. (See: writing-quotations)

“Behold,
“Look/Listen,” or “Listen to this,” or “I want you to know that”. This word means that what God says next is important and should be given special attention. Consider the best way to translate this term in your language. (See: translate-key-terms)

I have given to you
“I am {now} giving to you {as/for food}” or “I have provided {as food} for you” or “I am {now} providing {as food} for you”

every plant {that} yields seed that is
“every {kind/type of} seed-bearing plant that grows” or “every {kind/type of} plant with seeds that grows” or “all the {different kinds/types of} plants that yield/produce seeds and grow”. See how you translated a similar phrase in verses 11 and 12.

on the surface of the whole earth
“anywhere on/throughout the earth,”

and every tree that {has}
“as well as every {kind/type of} tree that {bears/produces}” or “and all the {different kinds/types of} trees that {bear/produce}”

tree fruit {that} yields seed inside it.
“fruit with seeds inside it.” or “seed-bearing fruit.” See how you translated a similar phrase in verses 11 and 12.

They will be yours for food.
“All of them are yours to eat from.” or “You may eat from any/all of those plants.”


Gen 1:30 And to every living thing of the earth, and to every bird of the sky, and to every{thing} moving on the earth that {has} living breath in it, {I have given} every green plant for food.” And it was so.

And
“In the same way,”

to every living thing of the earth,
“to every {kind/type of} {wild/untamed} creature/animal {that lives} on the earth/land,” or “to all the {wild/untamed} creatures/animals {that live} on the earth/land,” or “all the wild animals,” See how you translated a similar phrase in verses 24 and 25.

and to every bird of the sky,
“and every {kind/type of} bird {that flies} in the sky,” or “and all the birds {that fly} in the sky,”

and to every{thing} moving on the earth that {has} living breath in it,
“and every {other} {kind/type of} {creature/animal} that moves/lives on the earth/land and has the breath of life,” or “and all the {other} creatures/animals that move/live on the earth/land and breathe {air} to live,” See how you translated “that moves on the earth” in verse 28.

{I have given} every green plant for food.”
“{I give} every {kind/type of} green plant for/as food.” or “{I have given/provided} all the green plants for/as food.” For some languages it is clearer or more natural to put this phrase near the beginning of this verse and say, “In the same way, {I give} every {type of} green plant for food to all the {wild} animals {that live} on the earth, and all the birds {that fly} in the sky, and all the {other} animals {that live} on the land and breathe {air}.” Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated “plant” in verses 11, 12, 29. (See: figs-infostructure)

And it was so.
“And that is how it was.” or “And it/everything was {exactly} as he/God said {it should/would be}.” Consider again how you translated this sentence in verses 7, 9, 11, 15, 24 and 30. It may be necessary to translate it differently, depending on the context. For example, here in verse 30 this phrase follows a statement God made, which is different from the other contexts where it follows a command.

Gen 1:31 Then God saw all that he had made, and behold, it was very good. Then there was evening, and there was morning, the sixth day. 

Then God saw
“Then God observed/considered” or “Then God looked at”. See how you translated “God saw the light” in verse 4.

all that he had made,
“everything that he had made/created,” This refers to everything that God made during the entire week of Creation, not just on the sixth day. Consider again how you translated “made” (or “make”) in verses 7, 16, 25, 26 and 31. Compare that to how you translated a word that has a similar meaning (“created”) in verses 1, 21 and 27.

and behold,
“and indeed” or “and he saw/observed that”. This word calls attention to what God is looking at and helps emphasize that what he saw was very good.

it was very good.
“it was {all} very good/excellent.” Consider again how you translated “good/excellent” in verses 4, 10, 12, 18, 21, 25 and 31.

Then there was evening, and there was morning,
“Then evening came and {then/later} morning came,” Consider again how you translated these phrases in verses 5, 8, 13, 19, 23 and 31, and see the note about that at verse 5.

Gen 2:1 So the heavens and the earth were completed, and all their hosts. 
   
So the heavens and the earth were completed,
“So {it was that} the heavens and the earth were completed/finished {by God},” or “That is how {God} finished {creating/making} the heavens and the earth,” Verse one is a summary statement that looks back at what God did in chapter one. Make sure that is clear in your language. Also consider whether it is better in your language to use an active or passive clause here, and see how you translated “heavens and earth” in Gen 1:1. (See: figs-activepassive)

and all their hosts.
“including all the many things that are in them.” or “along with everything in them.” This phrase refers to everything in the heavens and on the earth that God had created, as described in chapter one.


Gen 2:2 And by the seventh day God had completed his work that he had done, so he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done.

And by the seventh day
“By the seventh day” or “By day seven”. Make sure it is clear in your translation that God had completed his work by the seventh day and did not work on that day. Also consider again how you translated ordinal numbers in Gen 1:5, 8, 13, 19, 23, 31; 2:2. (See: translate-ordinal)

God had completed
“God/he had completed/finished” or “God/he was finished with”. Decide whether it is better in your language to refer to God with a title (“God”) or a pronoun (“he”) in this context. (See: writing-pronouns)

his work that he had done,
“his/the work he had been doing,”	

so he rested on the seventh day from all 
“so he rested/ceased on that day from all” or “so on the seventh day he no longer did”. God “rested” in the sense that he stopped his work and did not work on that day. It does not mean he was tired or had lost his strength. Rest is an important theme in the Bible, so you should try to be consistent in how you translate this term here and in other passages such as Exodus 23:12, 31:17 and Hebrews 4:4, 10. Part of this theme includes the Hebrew word for “Sabbath” which has the same root word as the verb for “rest” and is often translated “resting day”.

his work that he had done.
“the work that he had been doing.” or “that work.”


Gen 2:3 And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because on it he rested from all his work of creating that God had done. 

And God
“Then God/he” or “God/He”. For some languages it is more natural to begin verse 3 without a conjunction. Other languages use a conjunction here like Hebrew does. Do what is natural in your language.” (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)

blessed the seventh day 
“established/designated the seventh day {as a day} to bless {people}” or “honored the seventh day”

and sanctified it,
“and made it a holy/sacred day,” or “and set it apart as a day especially devoted/dedicated to him,” or “by setting it apart as a special day/time {for people/them} {to rest and worship him},” (See: translate-key-terms)

because on it
“because on/during that day” or “{He did that} because on/during that day”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

“he ceased from all his/the work” or “he did not do any more work” or “he no longer did the work”. See how you translated a similar clause in verse 2.

“of creating that he had been doing.” or “that he had been doing, creating {everything}.” (See: writing-pronouns)

2:4-24 Adam And Eve And The Garden Of Eden

Gen 2:4 These {are} the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day when Yahweh God made the earth and the heavens,

These {are} 
“These {are more details about}” or “This {is more about}” or “What follows {gives/tells more details about}”. This phrase refers forward to Gen 2:5-24 and begins a new section. Chapter one of Genesis gives an overview of what God did each day of creation week, including that he created human beings on day six. Chapter two gives more details about how God created Adam and Eve, who were his most important creations. Each chapter emphasizes different parts of the same history; they are not two different histories. Make sure that is clear in your translation.

the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created,
“the history of the heavens and the earth when they were created {by God},” or “what happened when {God} created the heavens and the earth.” or “the history of what {God} did when he created the heavens and the earth:” The Hebrew text uses a passive construction here to emphasize the heavens and the earth. Decide the best way to do that in your language. (See: figs-activepassive)

in the day when
“during the days/time when” or “During the days/time when”. Consider whether or not it is clearer or more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here that continues into verse 5.

Yahweh God
“Yahweh {who is} God” or “God {whose name is} Yahweh”. This phrase is a combination of God’s personal name “Yahweh” with his title “God”. Both are used together when he is especially in focus. This pattern of using a personal name and a title together is also used for people in the Old Testament when they are being emphasized, for example, “Ahab king of Israel” and “Ruth the Moabite”. Many translations have “LORD God” in place of “Yahweh God” throughout the Old Testament. This follows the Jewish custom of substituting the Hebrew title “Adonai” (which means “my Lord”) for “Yahweh” (which means “he is”) when they read the Scriptures aloud. More recently, translation teams are putting “Yahweh” back in the Bible text (especially in the Old Testament, but also in the New Testament), and they include a footnote to explain the term. (Some translation teams consider using “Jehovah” instead of “Yahweh”. However that is not a name from the Bible, but is formed by taking the consonants from “Yahweh” and combining them with the vowels from “Adonai”.) (See: translate-key-terms)

made the earth and the heavens,
“made/created the earth and the heavens”. This clause forms a chiasm with “the heavens and the earth...created” in the first part of this verse. Try to keep the same phrase order in your translation. See how you translated “the heavens” and “the earth” in Gen 1:1 and 2:1. (See: figs-chiasm)


Gen 2:5 and every shrub of the field had not yet appeared on the earth, and every plant of the field had not yet sprung up, because Yahweh God had not caused it to rain on the earth, and there was no man to work the ground.

and
“And/Now {for a while,}” or “{For a while,}” or “{for a while,}” Consider whether it is better in your translation to begin a new sentence here or continue the sentence from the end of verse 4. Verses 5-6 give background information about what things were like before God created mankind (verse 7). Some languages use a conjunction like “Now” to introduce background information, while other languages do not use a conjunction. Do what is best in your language. (See: grammar-connect-time-background)

every shrub of the field had not yet appeared on the earth,
“there were not yet any shrubs/bushes {growing} in the fields on the earth,” or “no wild shrubs/bushes had started growing on the earth yet,”
   
and every plant of the field had not yet sprung up,
“nor had any {other} plants started growing yet,” or “and there were not any {other} plants that had sprouted yet,” See how you translated “plants” in Gen 1:11-12, 29-30.

because Yahweh God
“because Yahweh/he” or “{That was} because God”. The Hebrew text repeats “Yahweh God” frequently in chapter 2 (starting in verse 4) to emphasize God. For some languages, it is not natural to repeat “Yahweh God” so often in the same paragraph, and it could even give the wrong meaning that there was more than one Yahweh God. For languages like that, it may be best to use “Yahweh God” only once at the beginning of a section or paragraph, then use “Yahweh”, “God”, or “he” in the rest of the section, depending on the context. Consider what is the most accurate and natural way to refer to Yahweh God at each point in your translation. (See: writing-pronouns)

had not caused it to rain on the earth,
“had not {yet} caused it to rain on the earth,” or “had not {yet} sent/caused rain to water the earth,” See how you translated “earth” in Gen 1:1 and 2:1.

and there was no man 
“and there were no human beings {yet}” or “and mankind/humans did not exist {yet}”

to work the ground.
“to cultivate/farm the land/soil.” Working the ground includes tasks such as clearing the ground, preparing the soil, planting seeds, and watering the plants. See how you translated “ground” in Gen 1:25. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.


Gen 2:6 But mist came up from the earth and watered all of the surface of the ground.

But mist
“But {during/at that time} mist/water/groundwater” or “{During/At that time} mist/springs”. The Hebrew word for “mist” refers to water in some form, such as water vapor, springs, or streams of water. Also, some translations begin verse 6 without “But”. Do what is best in your language. (See: grammar-connect-phrases-words)

came up
“seeped up” or “kept coming/seeping up” or “would come/seep up”. This verb describes a repeated or continuous action.

from the earth
“from the ground” or “from underground”

and watered
“and irrigated” or “and spread over” or “supplied water to”

all of the surface of the ground.
“the entire/whole surface of the land/earth.” or “the ground everywhere.”


Gen 2:7 Then Yahweh God formed the man {out of} dust from the ground, and he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.

Then Yahweh God
“Then Yahweh {who is} God”. The phrase “Yahweh God” is used here to emphasize that he is the one who created mankind. So it is best to keep that here in your translation, unless that would communicate wrong meaning. See how you translated this phrase in Gen 2:4-5. 

formed
“shaped” or “crafted”. This word describes what an expert craftsmen would do, and implies artistic skills and design.

the man
 “a man” or “the {first} man”. The definite article “the” is used here because this refers to a specific man, the first male human. For many languages it is more natural to use an indefinite article (“a”) to introduce him here, or to not use an article at all. Do what is best in your language.

{out of} dust
“{out of} dirt/mud/clay”. The word used here in the Hebrew text is usually translated “dust” (as in Gen 13:16, 28:14), but it can also be translated “dirt” (as in Gen 26:15) or “mortar/mud/clay” (as in Leviticus 14:42). The dirt would have been damp enough to be formed or shaped.

from the ground,
“from the earth,” See how you translated “ground” in Gen 1:25 and 2:5-6. You may need to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.

and he breathed
“and he/Yahweh blew/exhaled” or “Then he/Yahweh blew/exhaled”. For some languages, it is more natural to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language.

into his nostrils the breath of life,
“into the man’s nostrils/nose the/his breath that would make him live,” or “his breath into the man’s nostrils/nose to make him live,” This refers to God’s breath. As you translate the pronouns “he” and “his” in this verse, make sure it is clear in your language who is being referred to. (See: writing-pronouns) 

and the man
“so that he” or “and then the man”. Consider what is the most natural way in your language to refer to the man throughout verse 7. (See: writing-pronouns)

became a living being.
“became a living person.” or “became alive.” or “came to life.” or “started to live.”

Gen 2:8 Now Yahweh God had planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and there he put the man whom he had formed.

Now Yahweh God had planted
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean (1) “Now Yahweh God had {previously/already} planted” or “{Before that,} Yahweh God had planted”. This interpretation fits the context of chapter one, which says that God had made all the trees and plants on day three (Gen 1:11-12), three days before he created man (Gen 1:26-27; 2:7). Following this view, verses 8-14 give background information for what happens in verses 15-24. (2) “Then Yahweh God planted”. According to this interpretation, God made the Garden of Eden on day six after he created man. (See: writing-background)

a garden
“a {large} garden” or “a {large} farm/park”. The man lived in this garden and there were animals and many trees and other plants in it too, so it was fairly large. Make sure your translation of this term does not refer to something that is too small.
   
in Eden, in the east,
“in {the land/region of/called} Eden, {which was} in/to the east,” or “in the eastern part of {the land/region of/called} Eden,” In this context, “in the east” can refer to (1) the eastern part of the region of Eden (2) a region east of where Moses lived when he wrote this. It is best, if possible, to keep your translation of this phrase general here (like the Hebrew text).

and there he put the man
“and that is where he put the man” or “and in that garden he put the man” or “That is where he put the man”. Consider whether it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

whom he had formed.
“whom he had shaped/crafted.” or “whom he had created/made.” See how you translated “formed” in verse 7.


Gen 2:9 And Yahweh God had made to grow from the ground every tree {that} is pleasant to the sight and good for food, and the tree of life in the middle of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

And Yahweh God
“{There} Yahweh/he”. See how you translated “Yahweh God” in verse 5, and see the note about that there. (See: writing-pronouns)

had made to grow from the ground every tree {that} is pleasant
“had made/caused to grow from the ground every {kind/type of} tree that is pleasant/beautiful/delightful” or “had made/caused all {kinds/types of} trees to grow from the ground that are pleasant/beautiful”. See how you translated “every tree” in Gen 1:29.
   	
to the sight
“to the eyes” or “to look at” or “in appearance”

and good 
“and {that produce/have/grow fruit that is} good” or “and {whose fruit is} good

for food,
“for eating,” or “to eat,”

and the tree of life in the middle of the garden,
“including the tree whose fruit gives people {eternal} life, {which was} in the middle of the garden,” or “In the middle of the garden was the tree whose fruit makes people live {forever},” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

and the tree 
“along with the tree” or “as well as the tree” 

of the knowledge of good and evil.
“whose fruit enables people to know/discern {what is} good/right and {what is} evil/wrong.” The word “good” refers here to all that is morally right and pleasing to God, and “evil” refers to what is morally wrong and against his will. Keep that in mind as you translate these terms. (See: translate-key-terms)

Gen 2:10 And a river was going out from Eden to water the garden, and from there it divided and became four head{water}s.

And a river was going out 
“Now a river was flowing” or “A river was flowing” or “There was a river flowing”. Verse 10 gives more background information that began in verse 8. Many translations omit the conjunction “And” or “Now” here. Do what is best in your language. (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)

from Eden
“from/through {the land/region of} Eden”. The garden was inside the land of Eden, so as the river flowed through Eden, it watered the garden.

to water
”to irrigate” or “to provide water for” or “that watered/irrigated” or “that provided water for”. See how you translated “watered” in verse 6.

the garden,
“the farm/park,” See how you translated this phrase in verse 8.

and from there
“and from the garden” or “From there/Eden”. For some languages it is better to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language.

it divided and became four head{water}s.
Verse 10 is ambiguous in the Hebrew text. It could mean (1) “the/that river divided into four {smaller} waters/rivers.” This interpretation means that the river in Eden was the source river that watered the garden and then divided downstream into the four smaller rivers. (2) “there were four {smaller} source rivers that joined together and formed the larger river.” This interpretation means that the four rivers were source headwaters that flowed downstream and joined to form the larger river in Eden. If possible, leave your translation ambiguous here (like the Hebrew text does), so that either interpretation is possible.


Gen 2:11 The name of the first {is} Pishon. It winds through all of the land of Havilah, where gold {is}.

The name of the first {is}
“The name of the first {river} {is/was}” or “The first {river} is/was named/called” or “The first {river} is/was”. Most translations use past tense in verse 10, but then use present tense throughout verses 11-14. It may be best to use past tense throughout verses 10-14, especially since the rivers and places that are named in these verses no longer existed when Genesis was written, because the Flood completely changed the entire surface of the earth; after the Flood, the names of some of those rivers and places were given to new rivers and places.

Pishon.
“the Pishon {River}.” Consider whether or not it is natural in your language to use the article (“the”) with the name of a river. (See: translate-names)

It winds through
“It meanders/meandered through” or “which flows/flowed around through”. The word “winds” or “meanders” means that the river changed direction from time to time. Consider whether it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here, or to continue the previous sentence.

all of the land of Havilah,
“the entire/whole region of/called Havilah,” Be consistent in how you translate “land of” throughout this section. (See: translate-names)

where gold {is}.
“{a place} where {there is/was} {much} gold.” or “which has/had {a lot of} gold.”


Gen 2:12 And the gold of that land {is} good. Bdellium and onyx stone {are} there.

And the gold of that land
“In fact, the gold from that land/region” or “Indeed, the gold {that is found} in that land/region”. This sentence emphasizes the previous statement about the gold, and gives more information about it.

{is} good.
“{is/was} {very} pure.” or “{is/was} {very} high quality.”

Bdellium 
“{A kind/type of fragrant/sweet-smelling resin called} bdellium” or “A {kind/type of} fragrant/sweet-smelling resin/perfume”. The meaning of this Hebrew word is not certain. In many translations it is transliterated, that is, spelled the way the Hebrew word is pronounced. It may refer to (1) a fragrant/sweet-smelling tree resin that was used to make perfume; (2) a type of stone or crystal, or possibly pearl. (See: translate-unknown)

and onyx stone
“and {valuable} onyx gemstones” or “and {valuable} stones/gemstones called onyx” or “and {valuable} gemstones”. It is not certain what kind of stone this was, but most Bible scholars think it was onyx, which is a kind of quartz that is often black, but also occurs in many other colors, and can have stripes or bands of white (or other colors) running through it. (See: translate-unknown)

{are} there.
“{are/were} {also} {found} there.” or “{are/were} {also} in that land/region.” Make sure the verb tense you choose here fits with the way you translated verse 11.


Gen 2:13 And the name of the second river {is} Gihon. It winds through all of the land of Cush.

And the name of the second river {is}
“The name of the second river {is/was}” or “The second river is/was named/called” or “The second river is/was” . See how you translated a similar phrase in verse 11.

Gihon.
“the Gihon {River}.”

It winds through
“It meanders/meandered through” or “which flows/flowed around through”. Consider whether it is better here in your language to begin a new sentence or to continue the previous sentence. See how you translated this phrase in verse 11. 

all of the land of Cush.
“the entire/whole region of/called Cush.” See how you translated a similar phrase in verse 11.


Gen 2:14 And the name of the third river {is} Tigris. It goes east of Asshur. And the fourth river {is} Euphrates.

And the name of the third river {is}
“The name of the third river {is/was}” or “The third river is/was named/called” or “The third river is/was”

Tigris.
“the Tigris {River}.”
 
It goes east of
“It flows/flowed {in an area} east of” or “which flows/flowed {in an area} east of “ or “which was located east of”. The word “east” refers to where the river was located, not the direction it was flowing. 

Asshur.
“{the land/region of/called} Asshur/Assyria.” This Hebrew name is pronounced “ash-shur” and is spelled “Asshur”, “Ashur”, or “Assyria” in English, depending on the context. This was a region of land, because at that time there were no cities. Most translations have “Assyria” here. Consider again how you translated “the land of” in verses 11 and 13. (See: translate-names)

And the fourth river {is}
“{The name of} the fourth river {is/was}” or “The fourth river {is/was named/called}” or “and the fourth river {is/was}”. See how you translated a similar phrase in verses 11, 13-14. Also consider again whether it is best in your language to use present tense or past tense in verses 10-14.

Euphrates.
“the Euphrates {River}.” Consider again how you translated the names of rivers in verses 11, 13-14.

Gen 2:15 And Yahweh God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and tend it.

And Yahweh God took the man and put him 
“Now Yahweh God had {already} put the man” or “After Yahweh God put the man”. In verse 8 it says that God had already put the man in the garden, so the way you translate verse 15 should not sound like he did it again. This information is repeated here to continue the story from verse 8. (See: writing-background)

in the Garden of Eden
“in the garden in {the land/region of/called} Eden” or “in Eden Garden”. Notice that “Garden” is capitalized when it is part of a name. (See: translate-names)

to work it 
“to cultivate/farm it” or “so that he would cultivate/farm it”. See how you translated “work” in verse 5.

and tend it.
“and maintain it.” or “and take care of it.”


Gen 2:16 Then Yahweh God commanded the man, saying, “From every tree of the garden you may freely eat,

Then Yahweh God
 “Then Yahweh/he” or “he”. Consider whether it is better in your language here to begin a new sentence or to continue the sentence from verse 15. Also consider what is the best way to refer to “Yahweh God” here. (See: writing-pronouns)

commanded the man, saying,
“commanded the man,” or “commanded him,” Consider what is the best way to translate this quote margin in your language. (See: writing-quotations)

“From every tree of the garden you may freely eat,
“You may eat as much {fruit} as you want {to eat} from every/any tree in the garden,” or “You are permitted to eat whatever fruit that you want {to eat} from every/any tree in the garden,” 


Gen 2:17 but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, because on the day you eat from it you will surely die.”

but you must not eat
“except you must not eat” or “except for one: you must not eat” or “Except I forbid you to eat”. Make sure it is clear in your translation that God is not contradicting himself here, but rather he is giving an exception to what he said in verse 16. Also consider whether it is better here in your language to continue the sentence from verse 16 or to begin a new sentence. (See: grammar-connect-exceptions)

from the tree
“{any fruit} from the tree” or “{the fruit that grows} on the tree”

of the knowledge of good and evil,
 “whose fruit enables people to know/discern {what is} good/right and {what is} evil/wrong,” See how you translated this phrase in verse 9.

because on the day you eat from it
“because on the {same} day you eat {fruit} from that tree” or “because if you eat {any fruit} from that tree, on that {same} day” or “because as soon as you eat {fruit} from that tree”

you will surely die.”
“you will certainly/definitely die.”

Gen 2:18 Then Yahweh God said, “{It is} not good for the man to be alone. I will make a suitable helper for him.” 

Then Yahweh God said,
“Then/Next Yahweh {who is} God declared,”

“{It is} not good for the man to be alone.
“It is not good for the man to live alone.” or “It is not good that the man is alone.” or “It is not good for the man to live by himself.” 

I will make
“{So} I will make/create”

a suitable helper for him.”
“a helper/companion who is {just/exactly} right for him.” or “someone who is suitable/right for him and will help him.” or “a suitable companion to help him.”


Gen 2:19 Now Yahweh God had formed from the ground every living thing of the field and every bird of the sky. So he brought them to the man to see what he would call them, and whatever the man called a living creature, that {was} its name.
 
Now
“Now {previously,}” or “Now {before that,}” or “{Before that,}” The first sentence of verse 19 is a flashback of what happened before the events in verses 15-18 (which were first recorded in Gen 1:20-21, 24-25). Consider the best way to begin this sentence in your language. (See: grammar-connect-time-background)

Yahweh God
“Yahweh“ or “he”. Consider whether it is better in your language to use a noun phrase (“Yahweh God” or “Yahweh”) or a pronoun (“he”) here. (See: writing-pronouns)

had formed from the ground
“had formed/shaped {out of some dust/dirt} from the ground” or “had used {dust/dirt} from the ground to form/shape”. Translate this phrase in a way that makes it clear that this is background information that had already happened. Also see how you translated “formed” in verses 7-8 and “dust from the ground” in verse 7. (See: writing-background)

every living thing of the field
“every {kind/type of} creature/animal that lives in the fields/wild” or “all {the different kinds/types of} animals that live in the fields” or “all {the different kinds/types of} wild animals”. Consider how you translated a similar phrase (“every living creature of the earth”) in Gen 1:24, 30.

and every bird of the sky.
“and every {kind/type of} bird {that flies} in the sky.” or “and all {the different kinds/types of} birds {that fly} in the sky.” See how you translated this phrase in Gen 1:30.

So he brought them 
“So/Then he brought/took them {all}”. This sentence continues the storyline. Consider how your language continues a story after giving background information. Also consider whether “brought” or “took” fits best here in your language. (See: figs-go)

to the man
“to Adam”. Every translation team needs to decide when to use Adam’s name for the first time in the book of Genesis. The Hebrew word “adam” means “man” and is also Adam’s name; the choice that is not followed here in your translation could be put in a footnote. Some translations first use Adam’s name here in verse 19, when he is naming the animals. Many translations start using his name at the end of verse 20. Still other translations wait until 3:20 when he names Eve, and a few other translations begin in 3:9, 17 or 21. (See: translate-names)

 to see
“to watch/hear” or “to find out”

what he would call them,
“what he would name each one,” or “what names he would give/assign to them,” These names were labels for what kind of animals they were, such as “dog” or “horse”, not personal names like “David” or “Mary”.

Gen 2:21 So Yahweh God caused a deep sleep to fall on the man. And {while} he was sleeping, then he took one of his ribs and closed up its place {with} flesh.

So Yahweh God caused a deep sleep to fall on the man.
“So/Then Yahweh God caused the man to fall/go into a deep/sound sleep.” or “So/Then Yahweh God caused the man to sleep {very} deeply/soundly.” Many languages have a similar idiom for “caused a deep sleep to fall on” that works well here. Consider what is best in your language. (See: figs-idiom)

And {while} he was sleeping,
“Then {while} the man was sleeping/asleep,” Consider whether it is best in your language to use a pronoun or a noun here to refer to the man. (See: writing-pronouns)

then he took 
“he/God took {out}”. Consider whether to use a pronoun or noun here to refer to God. Make sure it is clear in your translation who is being referred to at each point in this verse. (See: writing-pronouns)

one of his ribs
This phrase is ambiguous in the Hebrew text. It could mean (1) “one of the man’s ribs {from his body/side}” or “a rib {from the man’s body/side}” (2} “part of the man’s side {from his body}”

and closed up its place {with} flesh.
“and filled in the place/hole where it had been with flesh {and healed it}.” or “and replaced it with flesh {and healed him}.” In this context, the term “flesh” probably includes muscles and skin. 


Gen 2:22 Then Yahweh God built the rib which he had taken from the man into a woman, and he brought her to the man.

Then Yahweh God
“Next he” or “After that he”. For many languages it is more natural here to use a pronoun to refer to Yahweh God. Do what is best in your language. After you finish translating a chapter or section, it is a good practice to read that section aloud and listen for what is the best way to refer to God and others at each place in the text. (See: writing-pronouns)

built the rib which he had taken from the man into a woman,
“made/constructed a woman from the rib which he had taken out of the man{’s body},” or “used the rib which he taken from the man to make/construct a woman from it,” See how you translated “rib” in verse 21 and see the note about that there. 

and he brought her to the man.
“and he took her to the man.” or “Then he brought/took her to the man.” See how you translated “brought” in verse 19. (See: figs-go)


Gen 2:23 And the man said, “This {one} now {is} bone from my bones and flesh from my flesh! She will be called ‘woman,’ because {it was} from a man {that} she was taken.”

And the man said,
“Then the man said/exclaimed,” or “{When the man saw her,} he said/exclaimed,” or “{When the man woke up and saw the woman,} he said/exclaimed,” Remember to only make implied information explicit in your translation if it helps people understand the text better, or if it is necessary to prevent wrong meaning or bad grammar in your language. (See: figs-explicit)

“This {one} now
“Now there is a person who” or “At last here is a person {like me} who” or “Finally/Ahh! Here is someone {like me} who”

{is} bone from my bones and flesh from my flesh! 
“{has} bones and flesh from me!” or “was made out of my own bones and flesh!”

She will be called ‘woman,’
“I will call her ‘woman,’ ” There is a play-on-words here because the Hebrew word for woman (“ishsha”) is similar to the Hebrew word for man (“ish”). You could put that information in a footnote.

because {it was} from a man {that} she was taken.”
“because she was taken {by God} from {the body of} a man.” or “because {it was} from {the body of} a man {that} {God} took her.” Consider what is the best way to translate this passive clause in your language. (See: figs-activepassive)


Gen 2:24 For that {reason} a man will leave his father and his mother, and he will cling to his wife, and they will become one flesh.

For that {reason} 
“Because of that,” or “That is why” or “Since the woman was created from the man’s body,”

a man will leave
“a/every man {who marries} will/must leave” or “{when a man gets married,} he must move away from”

his father and his mother,
“{the home of} his father and mother,” 

and he will cling to his wife,
“and he must unite/join with his wife,” or “and he must live in close relationship with his wife,” This idiom means that the man is committed to his wife and has a close physical relationship with her, too. Consider the best way to translate this in your language. (See: figs-idiom)

and they 
“so that they”. Some languages have a special dual pronoun for “they” that fits well here. (See: figs-youdual)

will become one flesh.
“become completely one/united.” or “they will become united in body {and spirit}.” or “will become united like one person.” The phrase “one flesh” is an idiom that emphasizes the close physical and spiritual unity between a husband and wife. Other languages may have a similar idiom. Consider how to best communicate this in your language. (See: figs-idiom)

2:25-3:24 The First Sin And God’s Judgment

Gen 2:25 And the man and his wife were both naked, but they were not ashamed.

And the man and his wife were both naked,
“Now {at/during that time} both the man and his wife were naked,” or “{At/During that time} the man and his wife did not wear any clothes,” 

but they were not ashamed.
“but {yet} they were not ashamed {about it}.” or “but {yet} they did not feel ashamed/embarrassed {about being naked}.” Some languages have an idiom for this clause that fits well here. Do what is best in your language.

Now the serpent
“Now the snake”. The conjunction “Now” introduces background information about the serpent. See how you translated this conjunction in Gen 2:5, 8, 19. (See: grammar-connect–time-background)

was more crafty than every living thing of the field
“was more {deceptive and} clever/cunning than any of the {other} creatures/animals that live in the fields/wild” or “was the craftiest of all the animals”. Make sure that your translation of “crafty” means that the snake had evil intent and was clever in a way that was not good. See how you translated “living thing of the field” in Gen 2:19-20.

that Yahweh God had made.
“that Yahweh {who is} God had made/created.” or “that God {whose name is Yahweh) had made/created.” Make sure your translation of this phrase refers to the animals that God had made, not the fields. Also see how you translated “Yahweh God” in chapter 2, beginning in verse 4.

And he 
“{One day} he” or “{One day} the serpent/snake”. If you use a pronoun (“he”) here in your translation, make sure it refers to the serpent, not God. (See: writing-pronouns)

said to the woman
“asked the woman,” or “{came/went to the woman and} asked her,” The snake asked a question, so some languages have to be more specific and say “asked” in the quote margin. Do what is best in your language. (See: writing-quotations)

“Did God really say, ‘You must not eat 
“Did God really/actually command you to not eat” or “Is it true that God commanded you not to eat”. Consider whether it is better in your language to translate this embedded quote as a direct or indirect quote. (See: figs-quotesinquotes)

“You will not surely die.
“{That is not true.} You will not die.” or “It’s not true that you will die.”


Gen 3:5 For God knows that on the day you eat from it, then your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God in knowing good and evil.” 

For God knows
“Actually, God/he knows” or “The reason God said that is he knows”. The connecting word “For” introduces an explanation here. Consider the best way to do that in your language. 

that on the day
“that as soon as”. See how you translated this phrase in Gen 2:17.

you eat from it,
“you eat {fruit} from that tree,” or “you eat some of that fruit,” The pronouns “you” and “your” are plural in this verse and refer to the man and the woman. Some languages have a special dual pronoun for this. Consider again how you translated “you” and “your” in verses 1-5. (See: figs-dual)

then your eyes will be opened,
“your mind/understanding will be opened/expanded,” or “you will gain/have new understanding,” or “you will understand/know new things,” Consider whether your language has an idiom like “your eyes will be opened” that would fit well here. (See: figs-idiom)

and 
“and {as a result}” or “so that”. The following clause is the result of their eyes being opened. Consider the best way to communicate that in your translation. (See: figs-grammar-connect-logic-result)

you will be like God in knowing good and evil.”
“you will be like God/him because you will know {what is} good/right and {what is} evil/wrong.” or “you will know {what is} good/right and {what is} evil/wrong just like God does.” The Hebrew word “Elohim” in this clause is ambiguous. It can mean (1) “God”, as it does everywhere else in the first 30 chapters of Genesis; (2) “gods” or “divine beings”; (3) “angels”. See how you translated “good and evil” in Gen 2:9, 17.


Gen 3:6 And the woman saw that the tree {was} good for food, and that it {was} pleasant to the eyes, and {that} the tree was desirable for gaining wisdom. So she took some of its fruit and ate {it}. Then she also gave {some} to her husband with her, and he ate {it}. 

And the woman saw that 
“The woman saw/observed that”

the tree
“the tree {produced fruit that}” or “{the fruit of} that tree” or “the tree{’s fruit}”. The word “tree” refers here to the fruit that is produced by that tree. Make sure that is clear in your translation. (See: figs-synecdoche)

{was} good for food,
“{was/looked} good/delicious to eat” 

and that it {was} pleasant to the eyes,
“and that the tree {itself} was/looked {very} beautiful,”

and {that} the tree was desirable for gaining wisdom. 
“and {she thought/believed} that {the fruit from} the tree would make her wise/wiser.” or “She {also} desired/wanted {to eat} the fruit so that it would make her wise/wiser.” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

So she took some of its fruit and ate {it}.
“So/Then she took/picked some of the fruit {from/off the tree} and ate {it}.” 

Then she also gave {some} 
“She also gave {some of the fruit}”

to her husband with her,
“to her husband, {who was} {there} with her,”

and he ate {it}.
“and he ate {it/some} {too}.” or “and he {also} ate {it/some}.”


Gen 3:7 Then the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they {were} naked. So they sewed fig leaves together and made aprons for themselves.

Then
“Immediately/Suddenly”. An immediate result of their sin was that they realized they were naked, which they had not been aware of before.

the eyes of them both were opened,
“it was as if their eyes/minds were opened/enlightened,” or “they both gained/had new understanding,” or “they both understood new things,” See how you translated the idiom “eyes...opened” in verse 5. (See: figs-idiom)

and they knew
“so that they realized” or “so that they became aware”

that they {were} naked.
“that their bodies {were} naked/uncovered {and felt ashamed/embarrassed}.”

So they sewed
“So they fastened/joined {together}”. The word for “sewed” implies here that some type of needle and thread were used. For example, they may have used a thin, sharpened stick for the needle, and plant fibers for the thread. If necessary, you could use a more general term such as “fastened/joined together” or “connected”. Also, some languages have dual pronouns that can be used in verses 7-8 for “they” and “themselves”. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-youdual)

fig leaves 
“{some} fig {tree} leaves” or “{some} {large} leaves from a fig tree”. Historical facts should not be changed in a translation, including the historical fact that Adam and Eve used fig tree leaves to make aprons. If fig trees are not known in your language area, you could say “{large} leaves from a tree called fig {tree}”. (See: translate-unknown)

and made aprons for themselves.
“and used/wore them like/as aprons/skirts/loincloths {to cover their nakedness/bodies}.” or “and wore them around their waists {to cover their nakedness/bodies}.” or “and used them to make clothes for themselves.” These aprons/skirts probably covered them from the waist down to somewhere around the knees.

Gen 3:8 Then they heard the sound of Yahweh God walking in the garden in the breeze of the day, but the man and his wife hid from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden. 

Then they heard
“Then/Later the man and his wife heard”. For some languages it may be clearer and more natural to put the noun phrase “the man and his wife” here and then use a pronoun (“they”) later in this sentence. Do what is best in your language. (See: writing-pronouns)

the sound of Yahweh God walking 
“the sound of Yahweh God{’s footsteps} as he walked” or “Yahweh God’s voice as he walked”. This phrase can refer to the sound of God’s footsteps or to the sound of his voice. Either meaning fits the context well and is followed by many translations.

in the garden 
“{around} in the garden” or “through the garden”

in the breeze of the day,
“{late in the afternoon} in/during the breezy/cool {time} of the day,” or “{late that afternoon/day} when there was a cool breeze blowing,” This idiom refers to the late afternoon or early evening when there is a breeze blowing and it is cooler. For some languages it is more natural to put this time phrase at the beginning of the sentence. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-idiom)

but the man and his wife
“but/so they”. If you use “the man and his wife” earlier in this verse in your translation, consider whether a pronoun should be used here. (See: writing-pronouns)

hid
“hid {themselves}” or “{tried to} hide {themselves}”

from the presence of Yahweh God
“from Yahweh God” or “from his presence/sight” or “from him”. Consider what is the best way to refer to Yahweh here in your language. (See: writing-pronouns)

among the trees
“in the midst of the trees” or “behind some trees”

of the garden.
“in the garden.” or “there.” Since the garden is already mentioned earlier in verse 8, it may be more natural to be general here and say “there”. Do what is best in your language.


Gen 3:9 So Yahweh God called to the man and said to him, “Where {are} you?” 

So Yahweh God 
“Then/But Yahweh God”. See how you translated this name for God in verses 1 and 8.

called to the man and said to him,
“called {out} to the man and asked him,” or “called {out} to Adam,” See the note at Gen 2:19 about when to start using Adam’s name. Also consider the best way to translate this quote margin in your language. (See: writing-quotations)

“Where {are} you?”
“{Adam,} where are you?” Notice that the word “you” is singular here because God is only addressing the man. (See: figs-yousingular) 


Gen 3:10 And he said, “I heard your sound in the garden, but I was afraid because I {was} naked, so I hid.” 

And he said,
“He/Adam answered {him},” or “The man replied,” (See: writing-quotations)

“I heard your sound 
“I heard the sound of you {walking}” or “I heard your voice” or “I heard the sound of your footsteps/voice {as you walked}”. See how you translated “sound” in verse 8.

in the garden,
“through the garden,”

but I was afraid because I {was} naked, so I hid.”
“but I was naked, so I was/felt afraid and I hid {from you}.” or “but I was naked and afraid {that you would see me}, so I hid.”


Gen 3:11 Then he said, “Who told you that you {were} naked? Did you eat from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?” 

Then he said,
“So Yahweh God asked {him},” Make sure your translation of “he” refers to Yahweh here, not the man. (See: writing-pronouns)

“Who told you that you {were} naked?
 “What made you realize/know that you were naked?” or “How did you find out that you were naked?” The pronoun “you” is still singular here. (See: figs-yousingular)

Did you eat from the tree
“Did you {disobey me and} eat {fruit} from the tree”

that I commanded you not to eat from?”
“that I commanded you, ‘Do not eat from it’?” For some languages it is more natural to use a direct quote here for Yahweh’s words. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-quotesinquotes)


Gen 3:12 Then the man said, “The woman whom you gave {to be} with me, she gave me {fruit} from the tree, and I ate {it}.”

Then the man said,
“But the man said/replied {to him},” or “The man answered {him},”

“The woman whom you gave {to be} with me, she 
“The woman whom you put here {to be/live} with me, she {is the one who}” or “It was the woman you gave to me who”. The pronoun “she” is emphatic in the Hebrew text. That, along with the position of “The woman” at the beginning of the sentence, shows that the man is strongly emphasizing his blame on the woman. Translate this clause in your language in a way that will show that emphasis. 

gave me {fruit} from the tree,
“gave me {some fruit} from that tree,” or “gave me some of the/that fruit,” See how you translated “fruit” in verses 1-6.

and I ate {it}.”
“so I ate {it}.” or “That is why I ate {it/some}.” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.


Gen 3:13 Then Yahweh God said to the woman, “What {is} this you have done?” And the woman said, “The serpent deceived me, so I ate {it}.”

Then Yahweh God said to the woman,
“So Yahweh God asked the woman,” Consider what is the best way to translate this quote margin in your language. (See: writing-quotations)

“What {is} this you have done?”
“What have you done?” or “What did you do?” or “Tell me what you have done.” God already knew the answer to this question, but he is giving the woman a chance to confess and explain what she did. God’s question probably also implies that he is displeased with what has happened.

And the woman said,
“But the woman said/replied {to him},” or “The woman said/replied,” or “She replied,” (See: writing-quotations)

“The serpent
“The snake” or “It was the serpent/snake that”. This phrase is emphasized in the Hebrew text.

deceived me,
“tricked me,” or “lied to me,” 

so I ate {it}.”
“so I ate {some of the/that fruit}.” or “That is why I ate {it/some}.” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

Gen 3:14 Then Yahweh God said to the serpent, “Because you have done this, you are cursed above all the livestock and above every living thing of the field. You will move on your belly, and you will eat dust all the days of your life.

Then Yahweh God said to the serpent,
“So Yahweh God said to the snake,”

“Because you have done this,
“Because/Since you did that,” or “Because/Since you deceived/tricked the woman,” 

you are cursed
“you are cursed {by me}” or “I am cursing you” or “I will cause you to suffer” or “I will punish you”. In this context, “cursed” involves God punishing the serpent and its descendants by causing them to suffer by crawling along the ground on their bellies and having a hostile relationship with human beings. Make sure that the way you translate this term does not imply the use of magic. (See: translate-key-terms)

above 
“more {severely/harshly} than”. When Adam and Eve sinned and God judged them, the curse and punishment of death and decay also affected everything that was under their authority, including the animals. Here in Gen 3:14, God puts a more severe curse on the serpent (and his descendants) than he put on the rest of the animals.

all the livestock
“all the domestic/tame animals”. See how you translated “livestock” in Gen 1:24-26; 2:20.

and above every living thing of the field. 
“and more {severely/harshly} than all the creatures/animals of/in the fields/wild.” or “and more {severely/harshly} than all the wild animals.” See how you translated “every living thing of the field” in verse 1.

You will move on your belly,
“{As a result,} you will/must move/crawl {on/along the ground} on your belly/stomach,”

and you will eat dust 
“and you will/must eat dust/dirt {with your food}”. Make sure your translation of this clause does not imply that dust or dirt is all the snake will eat. Rather it could mean that dirt will get into his mouth when he eats his food, or it could be an idiom that refers to the fact that as he slithers along, his mouth will always be close to the dirt on the ground (a position of humility). Also see how you translated “dust” in Gen 2:7.

all the days of your life.
“your entire life.” or “for as long as you live.”


Gen 3:15 I will also put hostility between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring. He will strike you {on} the head, and you will strike him {on} the heel.”

I will also
“Besides that, I will”

put hostility between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring.
“cause you and the woman to be enemies {with each other}, and your offspring/descendants and her offspring/descendants to also be enemies.” or “I will cause you and your descendants to be enemies with the woman and her descendants.”

He
“{In fact,} her offspring/descendant” or “{In fact,} one of her descendants”. The pronoun “He” is ambiguous here. It could refer to (1) the woman’s descendant (Jesus) who would one day come to earth as the Messiah/Christ. (2) the woman’s descendants who will constantly be enemies of the snake’s descendants. If you follow the first interpretation, this would be the first prophecy in the Bible about the Messiah/Christ (“the Anointed One” or “the Promised Savior King”) who would come to earth and destroy Satan’s power (Hebrews 2:14). You could include that information in a footnote.

will strike you {on} the head, and you will strike him {on} the heel.”
“will strike/crush your head, and you will strike/bite/bruise his heel.” This is figurative language that Satan will harm the Messiah, but the Messiah will destroy him. For some languages it is better to switch the order of these clauses and say, “{In fact,} you will strike/bite/bruise the heel of one of her descendants, but he will strike/crush your head.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

Gen 3:16 To the woman he said, “I will greatly multiply your pain and your childbearing; in pain you will bear children. Yet your desire {will be} for your husband, and he will rule over you.”

To the woman he said,
“{Then} he/God said to the woman,” or “{Then} Yahweh God {turned} to the woman and said {to her},” In the Hebrew text, “to the woman” comes first in this sentence, to emphasize her. Do what is natural in your language. Also consider what is the best way to refer to God here in your language. (See: writing-pronouns)
 
“I will greatly multiply your pain
“I will greatly increase how much you suffer” or “I will cause you to have/experience much/severe pain” or “I will cause it to be very painful”

and your childbearing;
“when you bear children;” or “when you give birth;”

in pain you will bear children. 
“{yes/indeed,} you will suffer much pain when you give birth.” or “{yes/indeed,} bearing children will be very painful for you.” This clause is the second part of a parallelism, which emphasizes the pain and suffering that women will experience when they bear children. If possible, it is best to keep both parts of the parallelism in your translation. (See: figs-parallelism)

Yet your desire {will be} for your husband, and
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here, because the conjunctions and the idiom “your desire will be for your husband” are all ambiguous in this context. The text can mean (1) “Yet/But you will {still} desire/long {to be with} your husband, and....”, which is similar to what “desire” means in Song of Songs 7:10. (2) “Besides that, you will desire/want {to control} your husband, but....”, which is similar to what “desire” means in Gen 4:7. The interpretation that is not followed in your translation could be put in a footnote.

he will rule over you.”
“he will have authority over you.” or “he will control you.” or “he will lord it over you.” See how you translated “rule over” in Gen 1:18. It may be necessary to translate this term differently here because of the negative context of the curse and the consequences of sin.

Gen 3:17 Then to the man he said, “Since you listened to the voice of your wife and ate from the tree that I commanded you, saying, ‘You must not eat from it,’ the ground is cursed because of you. By painful toil you will eat {from} it all the days of your life.

Then to the man he said,
“Then/Next he/God said to the man,” or “Then/Next Yahweh God {turned} to Adam and said {to him},” In the Hebrew text, “to the man” is emphasized. See how you translated a similar case (“to the woman”) in verse 16. For a note about when to start using Adam’s name in your translation see Gen 2:19.

“Since you
“Since/Because you {disobeyed me and}”

listened to the voice of your wife
“did what your wife said/suggested” or “did/followed what your wife told you to do”. This phrase means that Adam heard what his wife said to him and then did what she said. Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language. (See: figs-metonymy)

and ate from the tree 
“and ate {fruit} from the tree”

that I commanded you, saying, ‘You must not eat from it,’ 
“that I commanded/told you, “Do not eat {any fruit} from it,” or “that I commanded you to not eat {any fruit} from.” Consider whether it is better in your language to translate this embedded quote as a direct or indirect quote. Also see how you translated this command in verse 3. (See: figs-quotesinquotes) 

the ground is cursed because of you.
“the ground is cursed {by me} because of what you did.” or “I have cursed the ground because you sinned.” For some languages it may be clearer or more natural to break up this long sentence and say, “You did what your wife said and ate {fruit} from the tree that I commanded you not to eat {any fruit} from. Because of what you did, I have cursed the ground.” Also see how you translated “cursed” in verse 14. (See: figs-infostructure)

By painful toil you will eat {from} it
“{As a result,} {only} by painful toil will you eat {any food} from it” or “{As a result,} you will have to work {very} hard and suffer {to grow/get enough food} to eat” (See: grammar-connect-logic-result)

all the days of your life.
“every day of your life.” or “for your entire life.” or “for as long as you live.” You could put this clause before the previous clause and say, “{As a result,} for as long as you live, you will have to work {very} hard and suffer...” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 3:18 And it will produce thorn{s} and thistle{s} for you, and you will eat the plant{s} of the field{s}.

And it will produce thorn{s} and thistle{s}
“In fact, the ground will produce/grow thorn {plants} and thistle {plants} {and other weeds}” or “In fact, thornbushes and thistle plants {and other weeds} will grow from the ground”. The thorn and thistle plants represent all types of weeds, which are useless, and possibly harmful, plants. (See: figs-synecdoche)

for you, and you will eat the plant{s} of the field{s}.
The Hebrew text here can mean (1) “{and make it difficult} for you to grow {enough} crops in the/your fields for food.” or “so that you will have to work very hard in your fields to grow/produce {enough} crops/food to eat.” (2) “so that {your crops will not grow well and} you will {have to} eat {wild} plants that grow in the {open} fields {to survive}.” That difference of interpretation is caused because the Hebrew word “fields” can refer to land that people cultivate or to uncultivated land where wild plants grow. 


Gen 3:19 By the sweat of your nose you will eat bread, until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken. For you {are} dust, and to dust you will return.”

By the sweat of your nose you will
“By the sweat of your face/brow/forehead” or “You will have to {work hard and} sweat a lot in order to”. The phrase “by the sweat of your nose/brow” is an idiom that refers to hard physical labor. Consider whether or not your language has a similar idiom. (See: figs-idiom)

eat bread,
“{grow/produce/have} {enough} food to eat,” Bread was one of the main food staples for that time and culture, so the Hebrew word for “bread” is used here as an idiom that refers to all food, not just bread. Consider whether your language does something similar, using one type of food (such as bread, rice or potatoes) to refer to all food in general. Or you could use a general term like “food”, especially if bread is rare or expensive in your language area. (See: figs-idiom)

until you return to the ground,
“until you {die and} again become dust/dirt,” 

since from it you were taken.
“which you were taken/made from {by me}.” or “which I took/created you from.” or “which I made/created you out of.”

For
“Yes/Indeed,” or “That’s right,” This sentence rephrases and emphasizes what God just said. (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)

you {are} dust
“your bodies {were created/made} {by me} from dust/dirt” or “{I created/made} you out of dust/dirt”

and to dust you will return.”
“so dust/dirt is what you will become again {after you die}.”

Gen 3:20 Then the man called the name of his wife Eve, because she was the mother of all the living.

called the name of his wife 
“called/named his wife” or “gave his wife the name”

Eve,
“Eve, {which means “living/live,”}” If you include the meaning of Eve’s name in your translation or in a footnote, make sure it is similar to the word in the following clause that has the same meaning (“living”), so that it is clear why Eve was given that name. The meaning of names is important in the Hebrew language, and this translation issue occurs frequently in the book of Genesis. (See: translate-names)

“{He did that} because”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

Gen 3:22 Then Yahweh God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of us in knowing good and evil. And now he must not be allowed to reach out his hand and also take {fruit} from the tree of life and eat it and live forever!” 

Then Yahweh God 
“Then he”. Consider whether it is best in your language to use Yahweh’s name or a pronoun in this context. (See: writing-pronouns) 

said,
said/thought,” or “said/thought {to himself}”. See how you translated a similar quote margin in Gen 1:26, where “said” has the same meaning.

“Behold,
“Look/Listen,” This word expresses emotion and calls attention to what God says next. See how you translated this term in Gen 1:29.

the man
“the man {and his wife}” or “man{kind}” or “human beings”. Throughout verses 22-24 “the man” represents mankind, which included both the man and the woman at this point. Make sure your translation communicates that clearly in those verses and does not just refer to Adam.

has become like one of us
“have become like one of us” or “have become like us”. The pronoun “us” is inclusive because God is talking to himself. (See: figs-exclusive)

in knowing good and evil. 
“so that they know {what is} good and {what is} evil.” See how you translated this phrase in verse 5, and a similar phrase in Gen 2:9.

And now he must not be allowed to
“So now they must not be permitted {by us} to” or “So we must not allow/permit them to” or “So now we must do something so that they do/can not”. Consider the best way to translate this passive clause in your language. (See: figs-activepassive)

reach out his hand and also take {fruit} from the tree of life and eat it
“also take/pick and eat fruit from the tree of {eternal} life,” or “also eat fruit from the tree that gives people {eternal} life,” See how you translated “took/picked fruit” in verse 6, and how you translated “the tree of life” in Gen 2:9.

Gen 3:23 So Yahweh God sent him out of the Garden of Eden to work the ground which he had been taken from.

So Yahweh God
“Then Yahweh God” or “So {then} Yahweh God”. Consider again how you translated “Yahweh God” in Genesis 2 and 3, and see the note about this at Gen 2:4.

sent him out of 
“forced them to leave” or “expelled/banished the man {and his wife} from”. Notice that in verses 22-24, “the man”, “him”, and “he” refer to mankind, that is, the man and the woman. Make sure it is clear in your translation here that both of them were sent out of the garden, not just the man. Some languages have dual pronouns that are used for “they” and “them” in verses 22-24. 

the Garden of Eden
“the garden in {the land/region of/called} Eden” or “Eden Garden”. See how you translated this phrase in Gen 2:15.

to work the ground 
“to work/farm/cultivate the ground/land/soil”. See how you translated “work the ground” in Gen 2:5 and “work it” in 2:15.

which he had been taken from.
“which they had been taken/created from {by him/God}.” or “which God/he had taken/made them from.” It does not refer to the exact ground that he was made from. See how you translated “taken from” in verse 19.


Gen 3:24 And after he drove the man out, then he placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim {angels} and a flaming sword that was turning in every direction to guard the way of the tree of life.

And after 
“Then after” or “After”

he drove the man out,
“he/Yahweh/God drove/forced the man {and his wife} out {of the garden},” or “he/Yahweh/God expelled/banished them {from the garden},”

then he placed 
“then he stationed” or “he placed/stationed”

on the east side of the Garden of Eden 
“on/to the east {side} of the garden {at its entrance}” or “{at the entrance} of/to the garden, {which was} on its east side”. It is implied that the entrance to the garden is where the cherubim were placed to keep everyone from ever entering the garden again. Consider again how you translated “garden” in Gen 2:8-10, 15-16; 3:1-3, 8, 10, 23-24.

cherubim {angels}
“{some} {powerful} cherubim {angels}” or “{some} {powerful beings called} cherubim {angels}”. Most translations transliterate or borrow this term from Hebrew throughout the Bible. Cherubim are a special category of very powerful angels. Each one has four faces: a human face, a lion’s face, a bull’s face and an eagle’s face (Ezekiel 1:10; 10:14). Each of them also has multiple wings. You could include some of that information in a footnote. (See: translate-unknown)

and a flaming sword
“and a blazing/fiery/burning sword” or “and a sword made of flames”. A sword is a weapon that has a very long, sharp (often two-sided) blade that is longer than a knife, machete, or dagger and is attached to a hilt or handle. This sword may have had flames coming from it, or this may have been fire in the shape of a sword.

turning in every direction
“that was turning/swinging around in all directions” or “that was swinging/flashing back and forth”. It seems that the sword was swinging by itself since there is no mention of anyone holding it.

to guard the way of
“to keep everyone away from the way/path {that leads/goes} to” or “so that no one could get/go near”

the tree of life.
“the tree of {eternal} life.” or “the tree whose fruit gives people {eternal} life.” or “the tree whose fruit makes people live {forever}.” See how you translated this phrase in Gen 2:9 and 3:22.

Gen 4:1 Then the man knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain. And she said, “I have obtained a man with Yahweh!”

Then the man
“Then Adam” or “Then the man {Adam}”. For a note about when to begin referring to the man as Adam, see Gen 2:19.

knew Eve his wife,
“had {marital} relations with his wife Eve,” or “slept with his wife Eve,” or “was intimate with his wife Eve,” This phrase is a Hebrew idiom that means Adam had marital/sexual relations with Eve. Many languages have a similar idiom. Make sure you translate this in a way that is polite and will not offend or embarrass people, especially when read aloud. (See: figs-euphemism)

and she
“so that she” or “with the result that she”

conceived and bore
“became pregnant and {later} gave birth to”. Translate this term in a way that will not embarrass people, especially when read aloud.

Cain.
“{a son they named} Cain, {which means “obtained/acquired”.}” You could include the meaning of Cain’s name in your translation or in a footnote. See what you did for a similar case in Gen 3:20.

And she said,
“because she said/exclaimed,” or “{They named him that} because she/Eve had said/exclaimed,” This sentence explains how Cain got his name. Make sure that is clear in your translation. Also consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

“I have obtained
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) “I have obtained/acquired” (2) “I have produced/created”. If you include the meaning of Cain’s name earlier in this verse in your translation or in a footnote, make sure it matches your choice here, so that it is clear why he was given that name.

a man
“a male child” or “a boy/son” or “a baby boy”. For some languages it is confusing to refer to a newborn baby as a man. Do what is clear and natural in your language.

with Yahweh!”
“with {help from} Yahweh!” or “with Yahweh{’s help}!” For some languages it is more natural to put this phrase earlier in this sentence and say, “With Yahweh’s help I have obtained/acquired a son!” or “Yahweh has enabled/helped me to obtain/get a son!” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 4:2 Then she continued on to bear his brother Abel. Now Abel became a keeper of flock{s}, and Cain became a worker of the ground.

Then she 
“Then she/Eve” or “After that she/Eve”. Consider whether it is better in your language to use a pronoun or a noun to refer to Eve here. (See: writing-pronouns)

continued on to bear his brother
“also gave birth to his/Cain’s brother” or “gave birth to another baby boy, {who was} his/Cain’s brother”. The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. Cain and Abel may have been twins, or Abel may have been born sometime later after Eve became pregnant again. If possible, translate verse 2 in a way that allows for either interpretation. Also, if your language has a specific term for “younger brother”, you could use it here. (See: translate-kinship)

Abel.
“{whom they named} Abel.” or “{whose name was} Abel.”

Now Abel 
“Now {when the boys had grown up,} Abel” or “{When they grew up,} Abel”. This sentence introduces background information for what happens next. Consider the best way to begin this sentence in your language. Also, It is implied here that the boys had grown up to be adults. If necessary, you could make that explicit in your translation. (See: grammar-connect-time-background)

became a keeper of flock{s},
“became/was a keeper/herder of flocks/sheep,” or “became/was a shepherd,” or “raised sheep {and goats},” A flock can be a large group of sheep or goats, or a mixture of both.

and Cain
“whereas/but Cain”. Consider the best way in your language to contrast Cain and his work with Abel and his work. (See: grammar-connect-logic-contrast)

became a worker of the ground. 
“became/was a worker/tiller/farmer of the ground/soil.” or “became/was a {crop} farmer.” or “grew {food} crops.” Cain raised crops, not animals. See how you translated a similar phrase (“work the ground”) in Gen 2:5.


Gen 4:3 And it happened in the course of days that Cain brought some of the fruit of the ground {as} an offering to Yahweh. 

And it happened in the course of days that
“Then one day it happened that” or “As time went on/by, one day”. These phrases introduce an important new event. Consider the best way to do that in your language. (See: writing-newevent)

Cain brought 
“Cain offered/gave”

some of the fruit
“some of the crops” or “some of the edible plants”. The word “fruit” is general here and refers to any edible plant or crop that grows as the result of being cultivated. Make sure that is clear in your translation.

of the ground
“{that he had harvested} from his farmland/fields” or “{that he had raised/grown} in his fields” 

{as} an offering to Yahweh.
“to Yahweh as an offering/gift/sacrifice {to honor/worship him}.” The term “offering” refers to something that is given. (See: translate-key-terms)


Gen 4:4 And Abel also brought some of the firstborn of his flock{s} and some of their fat. And Yahweh looked {favorably} on Abel and his offering. 

And Abel also brought
“Abel also brought/offered/gave {an offering/gift/sacrifice} {to Yahweh}, {but what he offered/gave was}” or “But Abel offered/gave {to Yahweh}”. There is a contrast between Abel and Cain and between their offerings.

some of the firstborn of his flock{s}
“some of the firstborn {animals} from his flock{s}/sheep”. See how you translated “flocks” in verse 2.

and some of their fat. 
“and/including some of the fat portions of the meat.” or “and/including some of their best parts.” or “and/including the fattest/best parts of the animals/meat.” In that culture, fat was considered one of the best parts of an animal to eat. If that is different from how fat is viewed in your language area, that information could be put in a footnote.

And Yahweh looked {favorably} on
“Yahweh was pleased/happy with” or “Yahweh accepted”

Abel and his offering.
“Abel and his gift/sacrifice.” or “Abel and what he offered/gave {to him}.”
 

Gen 4:5 But he did not look {favorably} on Cain and his offering. So Cain burned with intense anger, and his face fell. 

But he
“But he/Yahweh” or “However, he/Yahweh” (See: writing-pronouns)

did not look {favorably} on Cain
“was not pleased/happy with Cain” or “did not accept Cain”. See how you translated “looked {favorably} on” in verse 4.

and his offering.
“and/or his gift/sacrifice.” or “and/or what he offered/gave {to him}.”

So Cain burned with intense anger, 
“So Cain was/became/felt extremely angry,” Many languages have a similar idiom that fits well here. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-idiom)

and his face fell.
“and his face showed that he was angry/upset.” or “and he frowned/scowled.” or “and his face showed it.” (See: figs-idiom)


Gen 4:6 Then Yahweh said to Cain, “Why are you burning with anger? And why is your face fallen? 

Then Yahweh said to Cain,
“Then Yahweh asked Cain/him,” The way you translate this quote margin should fit with the way that you translated the following three rhetorical questions. (See: writing-quotations)

”Why are you burning with anger? And why is your face fallen?
“Why are you so angry? And why are you frowning/scowling?” or “There is no need/reason for you to be angry and frowning/scowling.” God is using these rhetorical questions to correct Cain. Consider the best way to communicate that in your language. Also see how you translated the idioms “burned with...anger” and “face fell” in verse 5. (See: figs-rquestion)


Gen 4:7 If you do right, will {you} not {be} accepted? But if you do not do right, sin is crouching at the door, and its desire {is} for you, but you must rule over it.”

If you do right,
“If you do {what is} right,”

will {you} not {be} accepted?
“{you know that} you will be accepted {by me}.” or “{you know that} I will be pleased with you {and your offering/gift} {too}.” or “I will accept you {and your offering/gift} {too}.” God uses this rhetorical question here to remind Cain of something that he already knew. Consider the best way to do that in your language. (See: figs-rquestion)

But if you do not do right,
“But if you don’t do {what is} right,” or “But if you do what is wrong,”

sin is crouching 
“{then} sin {is like a fierce/dangerous animal that} is crouching/waiting” or “{then} sin will be crouching/waiting {like a fierce/wild animal}”. In verse 7 sin is personified, that is, it is treated as if it were alive, like a lion or some other fierce animal that wants to attack Cain. Some languages can do the same thing. Other languages cannot do that and must say something like: “then you are in great danger of being tempted to sin, but you must resist and not give in.” (See: figs-personification)

at the door,
“outside your door {to attack you},” or “outside the door {of your heart} {to attack/tempt you},”

and its desire {is} for you,
“It/Sin desires/wants {to control/destroy} you,” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

but you must rule over it.”
“but you must master/control it {so that you do not sin}.” or “but you must keep/prevent it {from controlling/destroying you}.” or “but you must keep/prevent it {from doing that}.”

Gen 4:8 Then Cain spoke to Abel his brother. And it happened while they were in the field, then Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him.

Then
“But {after that,}” or “Later”. After God spoke to Cain, we do not know how long Cain waited before he spoke to Abel; it may have been a few hours or a few days.

Cain spoke to Abel his brother.
“Cain talked to/with his brother Abel.” That is what the Hebrew text has. Instead of that text, some ancient manuscripts (including the Samaritan Pentateuch, Septuagint, Latin Vulgate and Syriac) and many modern translations have: “Then Cain said to Abel his brother, “Let’s go out to the field {and work} {together}.” ” or “Then Cain invited/asked his brother Abel to go out to the field with him {to work}.” Some translation teams follow the way this verse is translated in a well-known translation, such as in the national language or in a neighboring language. Decide what to do in your translation. The textual variant that you do not use in your translation could be put in a footnote. (See: translate-textvariants)

And it happened while they were in the field,
“Then/So {they went out} to the field {to work} {together}, and/but while they were there,” For some languages it is necessary to make explicit that Cain and Abel actually went to the field. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-explicit)

then Cain rose up against
“Cain attacked” (See: figs-idiom)

Abel his brother 
“his {own} brother Abel” or “his {own} brother” or “him”. The Hebrew text keeps repeating the phrase “Abel his brother” to emphasize the seriousness of Cain’s crime. Consider the best way to do that in your language. See how you translated “brother” in verse 2. (See: writing-pronouns)

and killed him.
“and murdered him.”

_________________________Paragraph Break_________________________

Gen 4:9 Then Yahweh said to Cain, “Where {is} Abel your brother?” And he replied, “I do not know. Am I my brother’s keeper?” 

Then Yahweh said to Cain,
“Then/Later Yahweh asked Cain,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Where {is} Abel your brother?”
“Where {is} your brother Abel?” See how you translated “Abel...brother” in verse 8.

And he 
“He/Cain”. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin this sentence with a conjunction. (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)

replied,
“said/replied {to him},” or “answered {him},” or “responded/retorted,” (See: writing-quotations)

“I do not know. 
“How should I know?”

Am I my brother’s keeper?”
“Am I my brother’s guardian/caretaker?” or “Am I in charge of my brother?” or “Is it my job/responsibility to take care of my brother?” or “It’s not my job/responsibility to keep track of my brother!” Cain uses this rhetorical question to support the lie that he just told. His response to God is rude and disrespectful. Consider whether or not a rhetorical question communicates that here in your language. (See: figs-rquestion)


Gen 4:10 Then he said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood is crying out to me from the ground! 

Then he said,
“Then Yahweh asked/exclaimed,” Make sure that your translation of this phrase refers to Yahweh, not Cain. (See: writing-pronouns)

“What have you done? 
“What you have done is very horrible/terrible!” or “You have done a horrible/terrible thing!” God uses this rhetorical question to condemn what Cain had done. Consider whether or not a rhetorical question works well here in your language. (See: figs-rquestion)

The voice of your brother’s blood is crying out to me from the ground!
“Your brother’s blood is calling out to me from the ground {to avenge him}!” or “Your brother’s blood on the ground is like a voice/person calling out to me {for justice/revenge}!” or “I see your brother’s blood on the ground, and/so I must judge/punish you {for killing/murdering him}!” In the Hebrew text, blood is personified, as if it had a voice or could cry out like a person does. If it is not possible to do that in your language, you could say that his brother’s blood is “like a voice...”, or you could translate this sentence without personification. (See: figs-personification)


Gen 4:11 So now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand. 

So
“Therefore” or “Because of what you did,”

now you are cursed
“from now on you are cursed {by me}” or “now I am cursing you”. See how you translated “you are cursed {by me}” in Gen 3:14. (See: figs-activepassive)

from the ground,
“{so that you will not be able to grow food} from the ground/soil,” or “{so that you are banned/banished} from {working/farming} the ground/soil,” (See: figs-explicit)

which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood 
“which is covered/soaked with blood from your brother” or “which is where your brother’s blood spilled/poured out”. In the Hebrew text, “the ground” is personified as if it had a mouth to open. If that is not possible in your language, you could follow one of the alternates above. (See: figs-personification)

from your hand.
“when/after you killed/murdered him.”


Gen 4:12 When you work the ground, it will not continue to yield its strength for you. You will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.”

When
“Whenever” or “{As a result,} whenever”

you work the ground,
“you {try to} cultivate/farm the ground/soil,” See how you translated “work the ground” in Gen 2:5 and 3:23; also see similar phrases in 4:2, 11.

it will not continue to yield its strength for you.
“it will no longer produce/grow good crops for you.” or “it will not produce/grow enough food/harvest for you anymore.”

You will
“{From now on,} you will” or “and you will {also}”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.”
“be a fugitive/outcast who wanders around on the earth {without a permanent home}.” or “be a wandering/homeless fugitive/outcast on the earth.” or “{be rejected/shunned by people so that you} have no permanent home and have to move from place to place.” The phrase “a fugitive and a wanderer” forms a hendiadys. Consider what is the best way to translate that phrase in your language. (See: figs-hendiadys)

Gen 4:13 Then Cain said to Yahweh, “My punishment {is} greater than I can bear. 

Then Cain said to Yahweh,
“But Cain replied to Yahweh/him,” or “Cain said/replied,” (See: writing-quotations)

“My punishment {is} greater 
“Your punishment of me will cause me more suffering” or “You are punishing me more {severely/harshly}” (See: figs-abstractnouns) 

than I can
“than I am able to”

bear.
“endure.” or “live/cope with.”


Gen 4:14 Behold, today you are driving me from the surface of the ground, and I will be hidden from your presence. And I will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and it will be {that} everyone who finds me will kill me!”

Behold, 
“Look/Listen,” This term emphasizes what Cain says next. See how you translated this term in Gen 1:29 and 3:22. It may be necessary to translate it differently, depending on the context.

today you are driving me
“today you are forcing me away” or “you have now banished/prevented me”. See how you translated “drove/expelled” in Gen 3:24.

from the surface of the ground,
“from {farming/working/cultivating} the ground/land/soil,” 

and I will be hidden from your presence.
“and I will be separated from you.” or “and I will be far away from you.” or “and you will no longer bless me.” This clause is probably an idiom that means Cain will be cursed and no longer blessed by God. (See: figs-idiom)

And I will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth,
“I will be a fugitive/outcast who wanders around on the earth {without a permanent home},” or “I will be a wandering/homeless fugitive/outcast on the earth,” See how you translated this phrase in verse 12. (See: figs-hendiadys)

and it will be {that}
“and” or “so that”

everyone who
“anyone who” or “whoever”. Cain uses hyperbole here to emphasize his strong emotion. If possible, keep this hyperbole in your translation because it helps communicate how fearful Cain was feeling. (See: figs-hyperbole)

“sees/meets me will kill me!” 


Gen 4:15 Then Yahweh said to him, “For that {reason}, anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over!” Then Yahweh put a mark on Cain so that everyone who found him would not strike him. 

Then Yahweh
“So/But Yahweh” or “Yahweh”

said to him,
“said/replied to him/Cain,” (See: writing-quotations)

“For that {reason},
“In that case,” or “So then,” That is what the Hebrew text has. Instead of that text, some ancient translations (such as the Septuagint) and many modern translations have: “Not so/true.” or “That will not happen {because}”. The textual variant that you do not use in your translation could be put in a footnote. (See: translate-textvariants)

anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance 
“{I will warn everyone that} if anyone kills Cain/you, I will take vengeance/revenge on him {for you}” or “{I will make it clear to everyone that} I will take vengeance/revenge on anyone who kills you” What God says here implies that he will do something to prevent people from killing Cain; he is not just talking about punishing them if they kill him. If necessary, you could make that explicit in your translation. (See: figs-explicit)

seven times over!”
“{and punish him} seven times more {severely} {than I am punishing you}!” 

Then Yahweh put a mark on Cain
“Then Yahweh/he put a {special/distinguishing} sign/symbol on Cain” or “Then Yahweh/he marked Cain with a {special/distinguishing} mark/symbol”. We do not know exactly how Yahweh marked Cain, so keep your translation of this clause general (like the Hebrew text is).

so that everyone who found him would not strike him.
“so that anyone who saw/met him would not kill him.” or “to warn everyone who saw/met him not to kill him.” The phrase “strike him” is used here as an idiom that means “kill him”. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-idiom)
	

Gen 4:16 Then Cain went out from the presence of Yahweh and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.

Then Cain
“After that, Cain”

went out from
“went/traveled away from” or “left”

the presence of Yahweh
“Yahweh” or “the place where Yahweh had been talking to him”. Yahweh is everywhere, so this probably means that after talking to Yahweh, Cain left that place. (See: figs-metonymy)

and lived
“and settled” or “started living”

in the land of Nod,
“in the land/region of/called Nod, {which means “wandering,”}” or “in Nod Land,” The original readers of the Hebrew text knew that the name “Nod” means “wandering”. Usually translators transliterate (copy or borrow) the name from the Hebrew text, and they might also include the meaning of the name in the text or in a footnote. If you do that here, the meaning should be similar to how you translated “wanderer” in verses 12 and 14. (See: translate-names)

east of Eden.
“{which was} east of {the land/region of/called} Eden.” or “{which was} east of Eden {Land}.” Consider again how you translated “{the land/region of} Eden” and “the Garden of Eden” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 2:8, 10, 15; 3:23-24; 4:16.


4:17-24 Cain’s Descendants
  
Gen 4:17 Then Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. And he was building a city, so he called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch.

Then Cain knew his wife
“Then Cain had {marital} relations with his wife,” or “Then Cain slept with his wife,” See how you translated this idiom in Gen 4:1. (See: figs-euphemism)
 
and she conceived and bore 
“so that she became pregnant and gave birth to”. See how you translated this phrase in Gen 4:1. 

Enoch.
“{a son named} Enoch.” or “{a son they named} Enoch.” or “{a son whose name was} Enoch.” (See: figs-explicit)

And 
“And/Now {at/during that time,}” or “{At that time}”. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin this sentence with a conjunction.

he was building a city,
Cain was building a city,” Make sure that your translation of this phrase refers to Cain, not Enoch.

so he called the name of the city 
“so he called/named the/that city”

after the name of his son Enoch.
“after his son Enoch.” or “Enoch, after his son.” or “Enoch, the same name as his son.”


Gen 4:18 Then to Enoch was born Irad, and Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech.

Then to Enoch was born
“Later on, Enoch fathered/had” or “When Enoch {grew up,} he fathered/had” or “Enoch was the father of”. In this record of Cain’s descendants, It is implied that many years have gone by between each descendant growing up, getting married, and having his own children. Decide the best way to translate this genealogical record in your language. (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)

Irad,
“{a son named} Irad,” or “{a son whose name was} Irad,”

and Irad fathered
“Then Irad fathered/had” or “When Irad {grew up,} he fathered/had” or “Irad was the father of”. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin a new sentence with each new generation that is mentioned in this verse.

Mehujael,
“{a son named} Mehujael,” or “{a son whose name was} Mehujael,”

and Mehujael fathered
“Then Mehujael fathered/had” or “When Mehujael {grew up,} he fathered/had” or “Mehujael was the father of”

Methushael, 
“{a son named} Methushael,” or “{a son whose name was} Methushael,”

and Methushael fathered 
“Then Methushael fathered/had” or “When Methushael {grew up,} he fathered/had” or “Methushael was the father of”

Lamech.
“{a son named} Lamech.” or “{a son whose name was} Lamech.”

Gen 4:19 Then Lamech took two wives for himself. The name of the one {was} Adah, and the name of the second {was} Zillah. 

Then Lamech
“Then Lamech {grew up, and he}” or “When Lamech {grew up,} he”

took two wives for himself. 
“chose two women to be his wives.” or “married two wives/women.” In this context, the phrase “took for himself” is an idiom that means “married”. Consider whether your language has a similar idiom. (See: figs-idiom)

The name of the one {was} Adah,
“His first wife’s name was Adah,” or “His first wife was named Adah,”

and the name of the second {was} Zillah. 
“and his second wife’s name was Zillah.” or “and his second/other wife was named Zillah.”


Gen 4:20 And Adah bore Jabal. He was the father of {those} who live {in} tents and own livestock. 

And Adah bore 
“Adah gave birth to” or “Adah had”

Jabal.
“{a son named} Jabal.” or “{a son whose name was} Jabal.”

He was
“He/who was/became” or “He/who {grew up and} became”. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin a new sentence here.

the father of {those} who
the ancestor/first of {all} those/people who”. The phrase “father of” is used here as an idiom that means Jabal was the first person to do these things. He invented this way of living, and many people after him followed his example. (See: figs-idiom)

live {in} tents
“are tent dwellers” or “live in portable shelters”. A tent is a portable living place that has walls made of cloth or animal skins and is held up by poles. Tents are used by people who need to take their home with them as they move from place to place, often to find food and water for themselves and their livestock. If people in your language area are not familiar with tents, you could include some of the above information in a footnote. (See: translate-unknown)

and own livestock.
“and raise livestock/animals {for a living}.” The term “livestock” includes all kinds of domestic animals, such as cows, sheep, goats, camels, and donkeys. See how you translated “livestock” in Gen 1:24-26; 2:20, 3:14.


Gen 4:21 And the name of his brother {was} Jubal. He was the father of all who play harps and flutes.

And the name of his brother {was} Jubal.
“His/Jabal’s brother’s name was Jubal.” or “Jabal had a brother named Jubal.” Jubal was probably younger than Jabal. See how you translated “brother” in verse 2. (See: translate-kinship)

He was 
“He/who was/became” or “He/Jubal {grew up and} was/became”

the father of all who
“the ancestor/first of all {those/people} who”. See how you translated a similar phrase in verse 20.

play harps and flutes.
“play {musical instruments called} harps/lyres and flutes/pipes.” or “play stringed instruments and wind instruments.” (See: translate-unknown)

Gen 4:22 And Zillah also bore Tubal Cain, who forged all {kinds} of tools out of bronze and iron. And the sister of Tubal Cain {was} Naamah.

And Zillah 
“Zillah{, who was Lamech’s other wife,}” or “{Lamech’s other wife} Zillah”

also bore 
“also {became pregnant and} gave birth to {a son, and they named him}”

Tubal Cain
“Tubal-Cain” or “Tubal-cain” or “Tubalcain”. Be consistent with how you spell this name both times in verse 22. (See: translate-names)

who forged 
“who/He was {the first person to} forge/make” or “He {was the first blacksmith and} forged/made” or “He {was the ancestor/first of all those/people who} forge/make”. It is probably implied from verses 20-21 that Tubal Cain, like his brothers, was the father/ancestor or first of all those who had his skill.

all {kinds} of tools out of bronze and iron.
“all kinds of tools {and other things} out of bronze/brass and iron.” or “all kinds of bronze/brass and iron things/tools.” The word “tools” that is used here in the Hebrew text is general and can include farming tools and weapons and other things that are made out of metal.

 And the sister of Tubal Cain {was} Naamah.
“Tubal Cain had a sister {named} Naamah.” or “Tubal Cain had a sister {whose name was} Naamah.”

Gen 4:23 And Lamech said to his wives, “Adah and Zillah, listen to my voice. Wives of Lamech, hear my words: For I killed a man for my wound, even a young man for my bruise. 

And Lamech said
“{One time,} Lamech said {proudly}” or “{One day,} Lamech bragged/boasted”. Consider what is the best way in your language to introduce this new event. (See: writing-newevent)

to his wives, “Adah and Zillah, 
“to his {two} wives, “Adah and Zillah,  ” Be consistent with how you spelled these names in verses 19-20, 22-23.

listen to my voice. 
“listen to what I have to say.” or “listen to what I am going to tell you.” The phrase “my voice” refers here to the words being said. Consider what is the best way to translate this figure of speech in your language. (See: figs-metonymy)

Wives of Lamech, hear my words:
“My wives, listen to this:” or “My wives, listen to me carefully.” This clause forms a parallelism with the previous clause and emphasizes what Lamech says next. (See: figs-parallelism)

For I killed a man for my wound, even a young man for my bruise.
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean: (1) “I killed a man for wounding me; {he was} a young man who bruised/injured me!” or “I killed a young man for wounding/injuring me! In fact, I killed that man for {just} bruising me!” (2) “I killed a man for wounding me, and also a young man for bruising/injuring me.” or “A man wounded me, so I killed him. A young man injured me, so I killed him too!” In the first interpretation, Lamech refers to one man he killed. In the second interpretation, he refers to two men he killed.


Gen 4:24 If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech {is avenged} seventy-seven times!” 

If Cain is avenged seven times, then
“Since {God has promised} to avenge Cain seven times, then” or “Cain is avenged {by God} seven times, but” or “God will avenge Cain seven times, but”. Consider what is the best way to translate this passive clause in your language. (See: figs-activepassive)

Lamech {is avenged} seventy-seven times!”
“I, Lamech avenge myself seventy-seven times!” or “I avenge myself 77 times!” Lamech is bragging in verses 23 and 24 about how severely he avenges himself. He is not saying that God will avenge him more than he will avenge Cain. Be consistent with how you spelled the name “Lamech” in verses 18-19, 23-24.


4:25-26 People Start To Worship God Using His Name Yahweh

Gen 4:25 Then Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son, and she called his name Seth, because {she had said}, “God has appointed for me another offspring in place of Abel, since Cain killed him.” 

Then Adam knew his wife again,
“Then Adam slept with his wife {Eve} again,” or “Again Adam had {marital} relations with his wife {Eve},” See how you translated the idiom “knew” in 4:1, 17. (See: figs-euphemism)

and she
“so that she” or “with the result that she” (See: grammar-connect-logic-result)

bore a son,
“{conceived and} had a son,” or “{became pregnant and} gave birth to a son,” 

and she called his name 
“and she named him” or “and she gave him the name”. See how you translated a similar phrase in Gen 3:20.

Seth,
“Seth, {which means “appointed/granted/given,”}” (See: translate-names)

because {she had said},
“{She named him that} because {when he was born,} {she had said/exclaimed},” What follows is a direct quote of what Eve had said that gave Seth his name. Make sure that is clear in your language. Also consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. (See: figs-explicit)

“God has appointed for me
“God has granted/given to me”. If you include the meaning of Seth’s name in your translation or in a footnote, make sure it matches the way you translate “appointed” here, so that it is clear why he was given that name.

another offspring
“another child”

in place of Abel,
“to replace Abel,” or “to take the place of Abel,”

since Cain killed him.”
“whom Cain killed/murdered.” For some language it is necessary to put this phrase first in this clause (so that events are in the order that they happened) and say, “Since Cain killed Abel, God granted me another child to replace him.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 4:26 And to Seth also a son was born, and he called his name Enosh. Then {people} began to call on the name of Yahweh.

And to Seth also a son was born, 
“{Later on,} Seth also fathered/had a son,” The word order in the Hebrew text here emphasizes Seth. Do what is natural in your language.

and he called his name Enosh. 
“and he named him Enosh.” or “whom he named Enosh.”

_________________________Paragraph Break_________________________

Then
“At/During that time” or “That is when”

{people} began to call on the name of Yahweh.
“people began to address God by his name Yahweh as they worshiped him.” or “people began to worship/praise Yahweh by name.” or “people first called Yahweh by name in their prayers and worship.” The phrase “call on the name of Yahweh” is an idiom that refers to prayers, worship, and praise in which people addressed God directly by his personal name Yahweh. It also implies that they were trusting in him to help and guide them. (See: figs-idiom)

5:1-32 The Genealogy/Descendants Of Adam Up To Noah 

Gen 5:1 This {is} the written account of the generations of Adam: On the day God created man{kind}, he made him in the likeness of God.

This {is}
“Here {is}” or “What follows {is}”

the written account
“the written {family} record/history” or “the {family} record”

of the generations of Adam:
“of/about Adam and his descendants:” or “of/about Adam’s family-line/genealogy:”

On the day God created man{kind}, he made him 
“On the day {that/when} God created/made human beings, he made them”. See how you translated “created” in Gen 1:1, 27; 2:4, and “man” in Gen 1:26-27.

in the likeness of God.
“in his own likeness.” or “to be like himself.” God created mankind to be like himself in certain ways, not to be exactly like him in every way (Gen 1:26-27).


Gen 5:2 He created them male and female, and he blessed them and called their name “man{kind}” on the day they were created.

He created them male and female,
“He {also} created them {to be} male and female,” See how you translated this clause in Gen 1:27.

and he blessed them
“He blessed them” or “He said/promised that he would make them prosper/flourish”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Also see how you translated “blessed” in Gen 1:22, 28. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.

and called their name
“and called/named them”. See how you translated the phrase “called...name” in Gen 4:17, 25, 26.

“man{kind}”
“human beings”. Be consistent here with how you translated this term in verse one.

on the day they were created.
“on the {same} day {that} they were created {by him}.” or “on the {same} day {that} he created them.” Consider the best way to translate this passive clause in your language. For some languages it is clearer or more natural to put this clause earlier in this verse and say, “and on the {same} day {that} he created them, he blessed them and called/named them human beings.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

Gen 5:3 And Adam lived 130 years, then he fathered {a son} in his own likeness, according to his image, and he called his name Seth.

And Adam lived 130 years, then he fathered {a son}
“When Adam had lived 130 years, he fathered/had {a son}” or “When Adam was 130 years old, he fathered/had {a son}”. Each translation team needs to decide how they are going to write large numbers in the Bible. Many teams use numerals, for example, “130” here in verse 3, especially if the target language has a complicated counting system. Other teams prefer to use words, for example, “one hundred thirty” here. Be consistent in what you do throughout your translation. (See: translate-numbers)

in his own likeness, according to his image,
“who was {a human being} like himself and looked like him,” or “who was like him in many ways,” These two phrases have similar meanings and emphasize that Seth was similar to Adam in many ways. See how you translated similar phrases in Gen 1:26. (See: figs-doublet)

and he called his name Seth.
“and he/Adam named him Seth.” or “Adam named his/that son Seth.” For some languages it is more natural to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language.


Gen 5:4 And the days of Adam after he fathered Seth were 800 years, and he fathered {other} sons and daughters. 

And the days of Adam after he fathered Seth were 
“After he/Adam fathered/had Seth, Adam/he lived” or “After Seth’s birth, Adam lived” or “After Seth was born, Adam lived”

800 years,
“{another} 800 years,” or “800 {more} years,” For some languages, it may be more natural to change the clause order of this sentence and say, “Adam lived 800 {more} years after Seth was born,...” Do what is best in your language throughout this chapter. (See: figs-infostructure)


and he fathered {other} sons and daughters.
“He {also} fathered/had {other} sons and daughters.” or ”He was {also} the father of {other} sons and daughters.” This clause probably refers to all the other children that Adam had, including those who were born before and after Seth was born. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.


Gen 5:5 So all the days of Adam that he lived were 930 years, and he died.

So all the days of Adam that he lived were 930 years,
“So Adam lived a total of 930 years,” or “All together Adam lived 930 years,” Make sure that the name “Adam” is spelled consistently in your translation of verses 1, 3-5. (See: translate-names)

he fathered Enosh.
“he fathered/had {a son named} Enosh.” or “he fathered/had {a son he/they named} Enosh.” or “he fathered/had {a son whose name was} Enosh.” You could make it explicit in your translation or in a footnote that Enosh was a son. The same thing is true for the rest of the children who were born in this chapter (who were all sons). (See: figs-explicit)

6:1-8 Evil Increases On the Earth

Gen 6:1 And it happened when mankind began to multiply on the surface of the earth and daughters were born to them, 

And
“Now”. The events in Gen 6:1-2 started happening long before the events in 5:32, so the way your translation begins this verse should allow for that meaning and not begin with a sequence word like “Then”, which would have the wrong meaning here. Many translations omit the conjunction here. Do what is best in your language. (See: grammar-connect-time-background)

it happened when
“it happened that when/as” or “it happened that”. This phrase introduces and emphasizes important background information which the following narrative builds on. It also creates suspense so that readers and listeners wonder what will happen next. Some translations leave this phrase out, but that loses some of the suspense. Do what is best in your language. (See: writing-background)

mankind 
“human beings” or “people”. See how you translated this term in Gen 5:1-2. 

began to multiply
“began to multiply/increase {in number}” or “began to be more/very numerous”

on the surface of the earth
“all over the earth” or “throughout the earth/world”

and daughters were born to them,
“and they were having daughters,”


Gen 6:2 then the sons of God saw the daughters of mankind, that they {were} beautiful, so they took wives for themselves from any {of them} that they chose.

then
“then/Then {when those daughters/girls grew up,}” or “{When those daughters/girls grew up,}” Verses 1 and 2 are one long sentence in the Hebrew text. For many languages it is necessary to divide it into two or more shorter sentences. For example, depending on how you began verse one, you could begin verse 2 with a new sentence. Do what is best in your language. 

the sons of God 
“{some} angels” or “{some} supernatural beings”. The meaning of Gen 6:2 is not certain and is heavily debated, so it is probably best to translate it fairly literally and possibly include a footnote about what it means. If it is not translated literally, the literal text should be put in a footnote. There are three main views of who “the sons of God” and “the daughters of mankind” refer to: (1) nonhuman, god-like beings (supernatural beings), such as angels (as in Job 1:6, 38:7) or demons who took human form and married the daughters of human beings; 1 Peter 3:19–20; 2 Peter 2:4 [HYPERLINK: https://www.esv.org/2%20Pet.%202%3A4/], and Jude 6 [HYPERLINK: https://www.esv.org/Jude%206/] may be referring to this passage. (2) male descendants of Seth (the righteous, chosen family line) who married female descendants of Cain (the unrighteous family line). (3) sons of powerful men, such as judges or rulers (as in Exodus 22:8, Psalm 82:1, 6) who married the daughters of common, poor people.

saw the daughters of mankind, that they {were} beautiful,
“saw that the daughters of human beings {were} beautiful,” or “saw that those young women {were} beautiful,” or “saw that they {were} {very} beautiful,”

so they took wives for themselves from any {of them} that they chose.
“so they married any {of them} that they wanted to.” or “So they chose any/all {of them} that they wanted and married them.” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Also, see how you translated “took/married” in Gen 4:19.


Gen 6:3 Then Yahweh said, “My Spirit will not strive with mankind forever, because they {are} indeed flesh. Therefore their days will be 120 years.”

Then Yahweh said,
“Then/So Yahweh said {to himself},” Only make implied information explicit in your translation if it is necessary to prevent wrong meaning or if your language’s grammar requires it, so that your translation is easier to read and understand. (See: figs-explicit)

“My Spirit 
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean (1) “My Spirit” or “I”, which is a way of God referring to himself (Gen 1:2 is similar). (2) “My spirit”, which could refer to God’s breath that gives life (as in Gen 2:7). If the text is not translated literally, the literal text should be put in a footnote.

will not
“will no longer”

strive with
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) “strive/contend with” or “put up with” man’s rebellion (2) “remain/live with/in”. The interpretation that is not used in your translation could be put in a footnote.

mankind 
“human beings” or “people”

forever,
“always,” It may be more natural to put this term earlier in this sentence and say, “My Spirit will not always strive with mankind,” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

because they {are} indeed flesh.
“because they {are} certainly/very sinful/corrupt.” or “because they {are} only/mere {sinful/corrupt} mortals.” The word “flesh” is used here as an idiom that means human beings are “mortal” (that is, their bodies will die) and that they are “sinful/corrupt”. The two meanings are interrelated since it is because of sin that their bodies die. In this context, the focus is on their corrupt behavior, which is the reason God will send a flood soon. (See: figs-idiom)

Therefore
“So”. Many translations leave this word out. Do what is natural in your language.

their days will be 120 years.”
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) ”they will have 120 years {to repent}.” or “I will give them 120 years {to repent}.” (2) “{from now on,} they/people will have/live {no longer than} 120 years.” The first interpretation seems to best fit the context of God announcing his plan to judge mankind for their sin (verse 7). This would mean that Noah was 480 years old when God said this (about 20 years before he started having sons; Gen 5:32), since the flood came when he was 600 years old (Gen 7:6); you could put some of that information in a footnote. The second interpretation does not fit with the fact that after God said this, many people lived much longer than 120 years, so it does not seem likely that length of life was his meaning here.

Gen 6:4 The Nephilim were on the earth in those days and also after that, when the sons of God went to the daughters of mankind, and they bore children for them. They {were} the mighty {ones} who {were} from long ago, the men of renown.

The Nephilim
“{People called} the Nephilim” or “Giants”. Most translations transliterate (borrow or copy) the Hebrew word “Nephilim” here. The word means “fallen ones” and probably refers to their fallen (sinful) spiritual state. The Nephilim were the descendants of the sons of God and the daughters of mankind. The only other place in the Bible that the Nephilim are mentioned is centuries later in Numbers 13:32-33, where they are identified as evil giants. Based on that, some translations translate “the Nephilim” as “giants” here in Gen 6:4. (See: translate-names) 

were on the earth
“lived on the earth” or “were living on the earth”

in those days and also after that,

Gen 6:5 And Yahweh saw that the wickedness of mankind {was} great on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of their hearts {was} only evil all day long.

And Yahweh saw
“Yahweh knew” or “Yahweh was aware”. The verb “saw” is used here as an idiom. Consider whether your language has a similar idiom that would fit well here. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-idiom)

“how wicked/evil mankind/people had become on the earth,” or “that the people on the earth had become very wicked/evil,”

and that every inclination of the thoughts of their hearts

was sorry 
“regretted”

that he had made mankind 
“that he had made/created people/them” or “that he had made/created human beings”. See how you translated “mankind” in verses 1, 3, and 5, and consider whether or not it is best to use a pronoun (“them”) here in your language. (See: writing-pronouns)

“and his heart was filled with pain/sadness/grief.” or “and he was/felt extremely/very sad/grieved.” Consider whether your language has a similar idiom that would fit well here. (See: figs-idiom)


Gen 6:7 Then Yahweh said, “I will wipe away mankind whom I created off the surface of the ground, both mankind and animals, and crawling creatures and the birds of the sky, because I am sorry that I made them.”

Then Yahweh said,

Gen 6:8 But Noah found favor in the eyes of Yahweh.
 
But Noah found favor in the eyes of Yahweh.
“But Noah pleased God.” or “But/However Yahweh was pleased with Noah.” The idiom “find favor” means to please someone. And the idiom “in the eyes of” refers to someone’s opinion about something or someone. Consider whether your language has similar idioms that work well here or whether it is better to translate this sentence without an idiom. (See: figs-idiom)


6:9-22 Noah Prepares For The Flood

Gen 6:9 These {are} the generations of Noah: Noah {was} a righteous man. He was without blemish in his generation. Noah walked with God.

These {are} the generations of Noah: 
“This/Here is {more of} the account/record/history of/about Noah and his descendants/family:” or “What follows tells {more} about Noah and his descendants/family:” Some of Noah’s history has already been given in Gen 5:29, 32, and 6:8. What follows tells more about him.

Noah {was}
“He {was}”. Consider whether it is better in your language to use a noun or a pronoun here to refer to Noah. (See: writing-pronouns)

a righteous man.
“an upright/good man.” or “a man who did what was right.” (See: translate-key-terms)
   
He was without blemish in his generation.
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) “He {alone} was blameless/faultless {in God’s eyes} among his contemporaries.” or “Out of all the people living at that time, Noah/he was the only one {whom God considered} blameless.” (2) “He had a blameless/spotless reputation among his contemporaries. or “His contemporaries considered him to be a man of integrity.” The phrase “without blemish” is often used in the Bible to describe animals that have no defects. Here it is used as an idiom that means Noah was “blameless/faultless” in an ethical or moral sense, or that he had good integrity, but it does not mean that he was sinless. Consider whether your language has a similar idiom that would work well here. Also the word “generation” refers to people who live during the same time period. (See: figs-idiom)

Noah walked with God.
“{and} he walked {closely/faithfully} with God.” or “{and} he lived in a close/faithful relationship with God.” Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin a new sentence here. See how you translated this idiom in Gen 5:22, 24. (See: figs-idiom)


Gen 6:10 And Noah fathered three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

And Noah fathered
“Eventually Noah/he fathered/had {his}” or “And {as mentioned before,} Noah/he had”. The fact that Noah fathered/had these three sons was already mentioned in Gen 5:32. Make sure that the way you begin this verse in your translation does not sound like he fathered these sons a second time.

three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
“three sons, {namely} Shem, Ham, and Japheth.” or “three sons, {whose names were} Shem, Ham, and Japheth.”

Gen 6:11 Now the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled {with} violence. 

Now the earth 
“Now {the people of/on} the earth”. The phrase “the earth” is often used in the Bible to refer to the people who live on the earth. Consider whether your language can do the same thing, or whether it is necessary to make that implied information explicit. (See: figs-metonymy)

was corrupt 
“had become corrupt/wicked”

before God, 
“in God’s sight/opinion,” or “according to God’s standards,” (See: figs-idiom)

and the earth was filled {with} violence.
“and they had filled the earth with {their} violence/lawlessness.” or “and all over the earth they were doing violent/lawless things.” This clause forms a parallelism with the previous clause in order to emphasize how evil the people on the earth had become. The two clauses are different enough from each other that, if possible, it is best to keep both parts of the parallelism in your translation. Also be consistent with how you translated “the earth” earlier in this verse. (See: figs-parallelism)


Gen 6:12 And God saw the earth, and behold, it was corrupt, because all flesh on the earth had corrupted their ways.

And God saw
“God saw”. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin this sentence with a conjunction.

the earth, and behold, it was corrupt,
“that {everyone on} the earth was indeed/very corrupt/wicked,” or “how corrupt/wicked {everyone on} the earth had become,” See how you translated “corrupt” and “the earth” in verse 11. (See: figs-metonymy)

because all flesh on the earth
“because all the people on the earth” or “because everyone {living} on earth”. The phrase “all flesh” refers here to all people and probably implies that people are mortal (verse 3). (See: figs-synecdoche)

had corrupted their ways.
“were living corrupt/wicked lives.” or “were {continually} doing wicked/evil things.” or “were {continually} acting/behaving in evil ways.”


Gen 6:13 So God said to Noah, “The end of all flesh has come before me, because the earth is filled {with} violence because of them. So behold, I am destroying them with the earth.

So God said to Noah,
“So/Then God/he said to Noah,”

“The end of all flesh has come before me,
“I have decided to put an end to all human beings,” or “I am going to destroy all flesh/people,” Be consistent here with how you translated “flesh” in verse 12. (See: figs-synecdoche)

because the earth is filled {with} violence because of them.
“because they have filled the earth with {their} violence/lawlessness.” or “because all over the earth they are doing violent/lawless things.” See how you translated “violence” in verse 11.

So behold,
“Now listen,” or “In fact,” This phrase draws extra attention to what God says next. Consider the best way to do that in your language. 

I am destroying them
“I am going to destroy them” or “I plan to destroy them” or “I will destroy”

with the earth.
“as well as {everything else on} the earth.” or “and {everything else on} the earth {too}.” This phrase includes everything on the earth, not just the people. (See: figs-metonym)

Gen 6:14 Make an ark for yourself out of gopher wood. Make the ark {with} rooms, and cover it inside and outside with a covering.

Make 
“{Therefore/Consequently} {you must} make/build” (See: grammar-connect-logic-result)

an ark
“a {very} large boat/houseboat”. The term “ark” is general and refers to a chest/box that is closed on all sides, including the top. In this case, the ark was a very large boat that people and many animals lived in for a year. It had no motor, no oars, no sail and no rudder. Since this was a unique, one-of-a-kind boat that may already be well-known as the “ark” in the receptor language area, some translations transliterate (copy or borrow) the word “ark” throughout Genesis. Decide what is best for your translation. (See: translate-transliterate)

for yourself 
“for you/yourself {and your family}” (See: figs-explicit)

out of gopher wood. 
”from gopher/cypress wood {which is good for building boats}.” or “out of the best wood {for building boats}.” It is not certain what kind of wood this was, so many translations transliterate (copy or borrow) the Hebrew word “gopher”. Some Bible scholars think it was cypress wood. (See: translate-unknown)

Make the ark {with} rooms,
“Build/Construct the ark/boat with compartments/stalls {inside},” or “Make/Build rooms inside the ark/boat,”

and cover it inside and outside 
“and {completely} seal/coat it inside and outside” 

with a covering.
“with pitch/tar {to keep water out}.” or “with pitch/tar {to keep the boat from leaking}.” The Hebrew word “covering” is general and does not specify what kind of waterproofing material is being used. However, many translations are more specific than that here and refer to “pitch” or “tar” or some other material made from tree resin or sap that can seal a boat well and keep it from leaking. 


Gen 6:15 And this {is} how you must make it: the length of the ark {must be} 300 cubits, its width 50 cubits, and its height 30 cubits. 

And this {is} how you must make it:
“Build the ark/boat with these dimensions/measurements:” or “You must make/build the ark/boat like this:”

the length of the ark {must be} 300 cubits, its width 50 cubits, and its height 30 cubits.
“It {must be} 140 meters long, 23/twenty-three meters wide, and 14/fourteen meters high.” or “It {must be} 450 feet long, 75/seventy-five feet wide, and 45/forty-five feet high.” A cubit was about half a meter (18 inches) long, which was the distance from a man’s elbow to the tip of his middle finger. You can (1) translate cubits into meters or feet, and put the literal text in a footnote; or (2) keep “cubits” in the main text (so that the numbers 300, 50 and 30 are kept) and put what that equals in meters or feet in a footnote. (See: translate-bdistance)


Gen 6:16 Make a window for the ark and finish it to within one cubit from the top. And put the door of the ark in its side. Make a lower, a second, and a third {deck}. 

Make a window for the ark and finish it to within one cubit from the top.
“Make/Build a window/skylight for the ark/boat by finishing {the sides/walls of} the ark/boat to within one cubit below the top/roof {of the ark/boat}.” or “Make/Build a half-meter high window/opening between the top of the walls/sides of the ark and its roof {all the way around}, {to let light and air in}.” The meaning of the Hebrew text is not completely certain here, but God was probably telling Noah to make a one-cubit high window or opening at the top of the outside walls of the ark, just below the roof, all the way around the ark, to let light and air into the ark. See the note about “cubit” in verse 15. (See: translate-bdistance)

And put the door of the ark in its side.
“Also put/build a door in the side of the ark/boat.” or “Put/Build a door for the ark/boat in its side.” Some translations begin this sentence without a conjunction (“And” or “Also”). Do what is natural in your language. (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)

Make a lower, a second, and a third {deck}.
“Make/Build a lower {deck/level}, a middle {deck/level}, and an upper {deck/level} {on the inside}.” or “{and} make/build a lower, second/middle, and third/upper story/floor {on the inside}.” or “{and} make/build three {complete} levels/floors {on the inside}.” Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin a new sentence here.


Gen 6:17 And behold me, I am bringing floodwaters on the earth to destroy all flesh that {has} the breath of life in it from under the heavens. Everything that {is} on the earth will expire! 

And behold me,
“Behold me,” or “Listen {carefully} to me,”

I am bringing floodwaters on the earth
“I am going to bring/send a flood on/over the {whole/entire} earth” or “I {myself} am going to flood the {whole/entire} earth {with water}”. In the Hebrew text, the pronoun “I” is emphatic, both by its form and by its position at the beginning of the sentence. If it is clear and natural in your language, keep that emphasis in your translation of this clause. (See: figs-pronouns)

to destroy
“{in order} to destroy” or “which will destroy”. See how you translated “destroy” in verse 13.

all flesh
“all the creatures/beings” or “every creature” or “every living thing”. This phrase is general here and includes people and animals, so you may need to translate the phrase differently here from what you did earlier in verses 12-13 (where the focus seems to be on people).

that {has} the breath of life in it
“that breathe/breathes {air}”. See how you translated this phrase in Gen 1:30.

from under the heavens. 
“from under the sky.” It may be clearer to put this phrase earlier in this sentence and say, “to destroy every living thing under the heavens/sky that has the breath of life in it.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

Everything that {is} on the earth
“{As a result,} every {living} thing/being that {is/lives} on land“ 

will expire! 
“will breathe out {its last breath}!” or “will die/perish!” The verb “expire” (which could also be translated “exhale” or “breathe out”) is used here as an idiom that means “die”. Consider whether your language has a similar or different idiom that would work well here. (See: figs-idiom)


Gen 6:18 But I will establish my covenant with you, so you must go into the ark, you and your sons and your wife and the wives of your sons with you.

But I will establish
“But/However I will make/institute” or “But/However I will set up”. The word “establish” means to deliberately and formally put something into effect. (See: grammar-connect-logic-contrast)

my covenant with you,
“a covenant between me and you,” or “a {special/peace} agreement between me and you,” This covenant is made up of the unconditional, unbreakable promises that God made to Noah (and all mankind and all other living things) in Genesis 8:2-9:17. The word “testament” is another word for “covenant,” so the way you translate “covenant” here could be similar to the way you translate the titles “Old Testament” and “New Testament.” (See: translate-key-terms)

so you must go into the ark,
“so you must enter the ark/boat,” or “so you must get on board the ark/boat,”
 
you and your sons and your wife and the wives of your sons with you.
“and {take} your sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives with you.” or “and {take} with you your wife, your sons, and their wives.”


Gen 6:19 And from every living {creature}, from all flesh, you must bring two from each {kind} into the ark to keep alive with you. They must be male and female. 

And from every living {creature}, from all flesh, you must bring two from each {kind} into the ark
“Also, from every {kind of} living creature, {yes,} from every {kind of} animal, you must bring/take two/pairs of each {kind} into the ark/boat” or “You must also bring/take into the ark/boat two/pairs of every {kind of} living creature, including every {kind of} animal,”

to keep alive with you.
“{in order} to keep {them} alive with you.” or “so that they stay alive with you.”

They must be male and female.
“They must be male and female {pairs}.” or “Each pair must have/include a/one male and a/one female.” or “Make sure that there are male and female {pairs} {of each kind}.”


Gen 6:20 From the birds according to their kinds, and from the animals according to their kinds, from every moving creature of the ground according to its kind, two from every {kind} will come to you to keep alive.

From the birds according to their kinds,
“{Males and females} from/of every kind of bird,” 

and from the animals according to their kinds,
“and from/of {every} kind of animal,”

from every moving creature of the ground according to its kind,
“including every kind of creature that moves/lives on the ground/land,” This phrase emphasizes that the birds and animals mentioned in the first half of this verse lived on land.

two from every {kind} will come to you 
“two/pairs of every kind {of animal} will come to you” or “two/pairs of each kind {of animal} will come to you”. For some languages it is more natural to change the order of clauses in this sentence and say, “Two/Pairs of every kind of bird and every kind of animal, including every kind of creature that moves on the ground, will come to you” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

to keep alive.
“to keep {them} alive {on/in the ark/boat}.” or “{into the ark} so that they stay alive.” or “so that you keep them alive {in the ark/boat}.”


Gen 6:21 And you must take with you some of every food that is eaten and store it with you, and it will be food for you and for them.” 

And you
“You” or “You {and your family}”. Although the pronoun “you” is singular in the Hebrew text in verse 21, it could be translated as plural, since God’s instructions apply to Noah and his family, not just Noah. Or you could make his family explicit. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-yousingular)

must take
“must {also} {gather and} take/bring” or “must {also} gather”

every food 
“every {kind of} food” or “all the different kinds of food”

 that is eaten 
“that people and animals eat” or “that you and {all} the animals/creatures will need”

and store it with you, 
“and store/stockpile/put it {on the ark/boat} with you,”

and it will be food 
“This/That will be the food supply” or “so that there will be {enough} food”. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin a new sentence here.

for you 
“for you {and your family}”. Consider again how you translated the pronoun “you” in this verse. (See: figs-yousingular)

“and for {all} the animals.” (See: writing-pronouns)
 

Gen 6:22 And Noah did {that}; according to all that God had commanded him, so he did.

And Noah did {that};

7:1-23 Yahweh/God Sends The Flood

Gen 7:1 Then Yahweh said to Noah, “Go into the ark, you and all your household, because I have seen that you {are} righteous before me in this generation. 

Then Yahweh
“Then {after they had finished building the boat,} Yahweh” or “{When/After the ark/boat was finished,} Yahweh”. For some languages it may be necessary to make it explicit that the boat was completed before Yahweh told Noah to enter it. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-explicit)

said to Noah,
“told/commanded Noah,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Go into the ark, you and all your household,
“Enter/Board the ark/boat, along with your entire family,” or “You and your entire household/family must go/get into the ark/boat,” See how you translated “ark/boat” in Gen 6:14-16.

because I have seen
“because I have found” or “because I see/know”

that you {are}
“that you {alone} {are}” or “that you {are} {the only one who is}”. In the Hebrew text, the pronoun “you” is emphasized to show that Noah was the only one who was righteous.

righteous
“upright” or “living righteously/rightly” or “living the right way”. See how you translated “righteous” in Gen 6:9.

before me 
“in my sight/eyes/opinion” or “according to my standards”

in this generation.
“among the people living today.” For some languages it may be more natural to put this phrase earlier in this verse and say, “...you {are} {the only one} among the people living today {who is} righteous in my sight.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 7:2 From every clean animal take with you seven pairs, a male and its female, and from {every} animal that {is} not clean {take} two, a male and its female,

From every clean animal
“From every {kind of} pure animal” or “From every {kind of} animal that is acceptable to sacrifice”. It may be necessary to include a footnote that explains the concept of clean and unclean animals: In the Bible a “clean animal” was an animal that was acceptable to be sacrificed to God or to be eaten, and an “unclean animal” was one that could not be sacrificed or eaten; it does not refer to how clean the animal was physically. Later Moses wrote down the laws about clean and unclean animals in the book of Leviticus.

take with you 
“bring with you”. The pronoun “you” is singular in the Hebrew text, but could be translated as a plural to include Noah’s family. (See: figs-yousingular)

seven pairs, a male and its female,
“seven male and female pairs”. See how you translated “male and female” in Gen 6:19.

and from {every} animal that {is} not clean
“and from {every kind of} unclean/impure animal” or “and from {every kind of} animal that is not acceptable to sacrifice”

{take} two, a male and its female,
“{take} a/one male and female pair,” For some languages it may be better to change the order of the phrases in this sentence and say, “Take with you seven male and female pairs of every {kind of} clean/pure animal, and {one} male and female pair of {every kind of} unclean/impure animal,” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 7:3 also from {every} bird of the sky {take} seven pairs, male and female, to keep {their} offspring alive on the surface of the whole earth,

also 
“{and} also” or “In addition,” or “Also,” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

from {every} bird of the sky 
“from {every kind/type of} bird {that flies} in the sky/air” or “from {every kind/type of} bird”

{take} seven pairs, male and female, 
“{take} seven male and female pairs”. See how you translated a similar phrase in verse 2. Also, for some languages it may be better to put this phrase earlier in this sentence and say, “Also {take} seven male and female pairs of {every kind of} bird {that flies} in the sky/air,...” Do what is best in your language.

in seven more days 
“seven days from now/today”. The phrase, “seven more days” could be translated “another week” here and in verse 11. However, it is probably best to keep the number seven in the text in both places, especially since the number seven often signifies perfection or completion in the Bible, perhaps also here.

I will cause it to rain
“I will make it rain {continuously}” or “I will send rain”

on the earth 
“{all} over the earth/world”

{for} forty days and forty nights,
“{for} forty days and nights,” This refers to forty complete 24-hour days.

See how you translated this phrase in Gen 6:7. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 7:5 Then Noah did all that Yahweh had commanded him.

Then Noah did all that
“Then/So Noah did everything that” or “So Noah did everything {exactly} as”

Yahweh had commanded him.

Gen 7:6 Now Noah {was} a son of 600 years when the floodwaters came on the earth. 

Now Noah {was} a son of 600 years when
“Noah/He was 600 years old when” or “When Noah was 600 years old,” See how you handled large numbers in Gen 5 and in Gen 6:3, and see the note about this at Gen 5:3. Also see how you translated the idiom “son of...years” in Gen 5:32. (See: translate-numbers)

the floodwaters came on the earth.
“the flood covered the earth.” or “the earth was covered/flooded with deep water.” For some languages it may be more natural to put this clause first in this sentence and say, “When the flood waters came on the earth, Noah was 600 years old.” Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated “floodwaters” in Gen 6:17. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 7:7 And Noah and his sons and his wife and the wives of his sons went with him into the ark from the presence of the waters of the flood.

And Noah and his sons and his wife and the wives of his sons went with him into the ark
“{That is when} Noah/he and his wife, and his sons and their wives, went together into the ark/boat”. Noah and his family entered the ark on the same day that the floodwaters started coming (see verses 11-13). See how you translated a similar list of people in Gen 6:18.

{Pairs} from the clean animal{s} and from the animal{s} that are not clean
“{Also,} {every kind of} clean animal and {every kind of} unclean animal”. See how you translated “clean” and “unclean” animals in verse 2.

and from the bird{s} 
“and {every kind of} bird,”

and everything that moves on the ground
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean (1) “including every {kind of} creature/animal that moves/lives on land” or “which includes every {kind of} creature/animal that moves/lives on land“. According to this interpretation, the rest of verse 8 emphasizes that the clean and unclean animals and birds (verses 2-3, 8) were all creatures that lived on land (which are the creatures that the flood affected). (2) “as well as every {kind of} creature/animal that crawls/creeps along the ground”. According to this interpretation, the rest of verse 8 refers to a fourth category of creatures besides the clean animals, unclean animals, and birds.


Gen 7:9 went two {by} two to Noah into the ark, male and female, just as God had commanded Noah.

went two {by} two to Noah into the ark,
“came to Noah in pairs {and came/went} into the ark/boat,” or “came in pairs and entered the ark/boat with Noah,”

male and female,
“{They were} male and female pairs,” or “Each pair had one male and one female,” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

Gen 7:10 And it happened, after the seven days, then the waters of the flood came on the earth. 

And it happened, 
“So it happened {that}” or “Then”. This phrase focuses attention on an important event (the beginning of the flood), and it builds suspense so that readers and listeners wonder what will happen next.

after the seven days,
“when the seven days {that God had spoken about} had passed,” or “after seven days,” This phrase refers to the seven days which God talked about in verse 4. It does not mean seven days after Noah and the animals went into the ark (verses 7-9); they went into the ark on the same day that the flood started (verse 13). Translate the beginning of this sentence in a way that makes that clear. (See: figs-explicit)

then the waters of the flood came on 
“the floodwaters started to come on/over” or “water started to flood/cover”

the earth.
“the {entire/whole} earth.”


Gen 7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst open, and the windows of the heavens were opened, 

In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, 
“When Noah was 600 years old,” Compare how you translated Noah’s age in verse 6. (See: translate-ordinal)

in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, 
“on the seventeenth day of the second month {of the year},” For some languages it is more natural to switch the phrase order and say which day it is before giving the month. Do what is natural in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

and the windows of the heavens were opened, 
“and {all} the windows/floodgates in the heavens/sky were opened {by God},” or “{God also caused} the water in the heavens/sky to start coming/pouring down, as if he had opened {huge} windows/floodgates/faucets {in the heavens/sky},” (See: figs-metaphor)

On that same day 
“{So it was/happened that} on the {very} same day {that the flood/rain started},” This is the same day that is mentioned in verse 11, when the flood started. Verses 13-16 repeat what happened, in order to emphasize it. Make sure that a translation does not sound like this is the second (or third) time that Noah and his family and the animals entered the ark.

Noah and Shem and Ham and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and the wife of Noah and the three wives of his sons with them,
“Noah and his sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, along with his wife and his sons’ three wives {all}” or “Noah and his wife and his/their sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and their three wives {all}”. See how you translated a similar sentence in verse 7.

every living thing according to its kind, and
In the Hebrew text this phrase is ambiguous. It can mean (1) “every kind of living thing/creature, including” (2) “every kind of wild animal, and”. The animal groups listed in verse 14 show that every kind of animal was to be brought onto the ark. Your language may have a different way of grouping animals. Make sure it is clear in your translation of this verse that all the different kinds of birds and land animals are included.

every livestock according to its kind,
“every kind of livestock,” or “every kind of domestic/tame animal,”

and every moving creature moving on the earth according to its kind,
In the Hebrew text, this phrase is ambiguous. It can mean (1) “and every {other} kind of creature/animal that moves/lives on the earth/land,” which seems to fit this context best. (2) “and every kind of creature/animal that crawls on the ground,”

and every bird according to its kind, every bird of every wing.
“and every kind of bird {and} everything {else} that has wings.” or “and every kind of bird {and} every {other} {kind of} creature that flies.” This phrase probably refers not only to birds, but also to other creatures that have wings and fly, such as bats and insects.


Gen 7:15 So they went to Noah into the ark, two {by} two from all flesh which {has} in it the breath of life. 

So they went to Noah into the ark,

two {by} two from all flesh
“pairs of every {kind of} creature/animal” or “pairs of every {kind of} living thing/creature”. The word “flesh” refers here to any kind of creature or animal. (See: figs-synecdoche)

which {has} in it the breath of life.
“that breathes {air}.” See how you translated this phrase in Gen 6:17.

{were} male and female
“{were} male and female {pairs}”

from all flesh;

8:1-22 Genesis 8

Gen 8:1 But God remembered Noah and all the living creature{s} and all the livestock that {were} with him in the ark, and God caused a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters subsided. 

But God remembered
“God kept in mind” or “But God did not forget” or “God never forgot”. The phrase “God remembered” is an idiom in the Bible that often means God was paying special attention to certain people and was about to do something. Make sure that the way you translate this phrase does not imply that God had forgotten about Noah. (See: figs-idiom)

Noah 
“Noah {and his family}”. Noah is the one that the author is focusing on here, but Noah’s family is also included. Consider whether or not you need to make that explicit in your translation. (See: figs-explicit)

and all the living creature{s} and
In the Hebrew text this phrase is ambiguous. It can mean (1) “and all the wild animals and” (2) “and all the creatures/animals, including”. See how you translated “living creature” in Gen 1:24-25 and 7:14.

Gen 8:2 And the fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were closed, and the rain from the heavens was stopped. 

And the fountains of the deep and the windows of the heavens were closed,
“{He also caused} the fountains/springs in the deep {ocean} to stop {gushing out water}, and {he caused} the rain/water to stop pouring from the sky,” or “{God/He also} stopped the water from {gushing out of} springs/places at the bottom of the ocean, and the rain from pouring/coming from the heavens/sky,” See how you translated some of the same words and phrases in Gen 7:11.

“until the tenth month {of the year}. On the first day of that month,” or “until on the first {day} of the tenth month {of the year},” See how you translated a similar time phrase in verse 4. (See: figs-infostructure)

the tops of the mountains 
“the peaks of the {surrounding} mountains” or “the mountaintops”

Gen 8:6 Then it happened {at} the end of forty days that Noah opened the window of the ark that he had made, 

Then it happened {at} the end of forty days that 
“After forty {more} days {had passed},” The phrase “Then it happened” focuses attention on what happens next, and it builds suspense so that readers and listeners wonder what the outcome will be. Some translations leave this phrase out, but that loses some of the suspense. Do what is best in your language. (See: writing-newevent)

Noah opened the window
“Noah opened a window”. It is not clear when Noah made this window. It may refer to the opening around the top of the walls of the ark (Gen 6:16) or a different window that he made sometime later.

“But it” (See: writing-pronouns)

did not find
“could not find” or “was not able to find”

a resting place for the sole of its feet,
“anywhere to land/perch and rest,” In Hebrew the word “dove” is grammatically a feminine noun (for both male and female doves), so some translations say “her feet...she returned...” here. For languages such as English that do not assign grammatical gender to nouns, it is more accurate to use “its” and “it” here, because it is not known whether this dove was male or female. Do what is best in your language.

so it
“So/Then it” or “So/Then the dove”

returned to him in the ark,
“flew back to him/Noah in/at the ark/boat,” 

because the waters {were} over the surface of the entire earth.
“because water was {still} covering the entire earth/world.” Some languages may have to switch the clause order in this verse and say, “But water was {still} covering the entire earth/world, so the dove did/could not find a resting place for its feet. Then it returned to Noah at the boat, and he/Noah reached...” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

And he
“Then/So he/Noah” or “and he/Noah”

reached out his hand and took it and brought it 
“reached out, caught it, and brought it”

to him into the ark.
“{back} to himself in the ark/boat.” or “{back} into the ark/boat.”


Gen 8:10 Then he waited another seven days and again sent out the dove from the ark. 

Then he waited
“He/Noah waited”. Consider whether it is better in your language to begin this sentence with or without a conjunction. (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)

another seven days 
“seven more days,”

and again sent out the dove from the ark.
“then he sent the dove out from the ark/boat another time.” or “then he released the dove from the ark/boat again.”


Gen 8:11 Then the dove returned to him at evening time, and behold, {there was} a freshly picked olive leaf in its mouth. So Noah knew that the waters had subsided from the earth. 

Then the dove returned to him at evening time,
“That evening the dove returned to him/Noah,” or “When it was evening, the dove returned to him/Noah,”

and behold, 
“and surprisingly,” or “and he/Noah saw that”

{there was} 
“{it had}” or “{the dove had}” or “{it was holding}”

a freshly picked olive leaf in its mouth.
“a newly picked {green} leaf from an olive tree in its mouth/beak.” or “a {green} leaf in its mouth/beak that it had just picked/taken from an olive tree.” An olive tree produces small, oval, green fruit that has a hard pit. Olives are used for food and as a source of cooking oil. If olive trees are unknown in your language area, you could include a footnote about them. (See: translate-unknown)

So Noah knew
“Then Noah realized” or “That is how Noah/he knew/realized”

that the waters
“that the water/floodwaters”

had subsided
“had receded” or “had gone down {more/further}”. See how you translated “subsided” in verse 8, and how you translated three other Hebrew words with similar meanings In verses 1, 3, and 5.

from the earth.
“from the ground/land.” See how you translated this phrase in verse 7.


Gen 8:12 Then he waited another seven days, and he sent out the dove, but it did not return to him again.

Then he waited another seven days, and
“He waited another seven days, then” or “After he waited seven more days,” 

he sent out the dove,
“he released the dove {again},” See how you translated “sent out” in verses 7, 8, and 10. 

but it did not return to him again.
“but {this time} it did not come back to him again {because it found a dry place to land/live}.” Remember to only make implied information explicit in a translation if it helps readers’ understanding, or if it is necessary to prevent wrong meaning or incorrect grammar. (See: figs-explicit)

Gen 8:13 So it happened in the six hundred and first year, in the first {month}, on the first day of the month, the waters were drying up from the earth. Then Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked, and behold, the surface of the ground was drying.
 
So it happened 
“So it happened {that}” or “So it was,”

in the six hundred and first year, 
“In {his/Noah’s} 601st year,” or “when {Noah was} 601 years old,” See how you translated a similar phrase in Gen 7:11.

in the first {month}, on the first day of the month,
“in the first {month} {of the year}, on the first day of the month,” or “on the first day of the first month {of the year},” (See: translate-ordinal)

the waters were drying up
“the water was drying up” or “the water had {almost} dried up”. Make sure your translation of this phrase fits with the fact that the ground was not yet dry enough to get out of the ark. That did not happen until the end of the second month (verse 14).

“from the ground/land.” 

Then Noah removed
“So Noah/he took off {part of}” or “made an opening in”

the covering of the ark
“the roof that was covering the ark/boat” or “the roof of the ark/boat”

Then in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month,
“Then by the twenty-seventh day of the second month {of the year},” See how you translated similar time phrases in verses 4, 5, and 13.

the earth
“the land/ground”. Notice that the land/ground was dry here, not the entire earth. Consider again how you translated this phrase in verses 3, 7, 11, 13-14.

Gen 8:16 “Go out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and the wives of your sons with you. 

“Go out of the ark,
“Come out of/from the ark/boat” or “Disembark from the ark/boat”. Consider whether “come” or “go” is more natural here in your language. Also, some languages have a special term for getting off a boat that fits well here. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-go)

Gen 8:17 Bring out with you every living thing that {is} with you, all flesh, including the birds and the livestock and every moving creature moving on the earth, so that they will abound on the earth and be fruitful and multiply over the earth.” 

Bring out with you
“Bring/Take with you” or “Bring/Take out”. Consider whether “bring” or “take” is more natural here in your language. (See: figs-go)

every living thing that {is}
“all the living things/creatures that {are}” or “all the animals that {are}”

including the birds and the livestock
“including the birds, domestic/tame animals,”

and every moving creature moving
In the Hebrew text this phrase is ambiguous. It can mean (1) “and every {other} creature/animal that moves/lives”, which seems to fit this context best since it is general and includes all the land animals that were not birds or livestock. (2) “and every creature/animal that crawls”, which is more specific and refers to animals like lizards, snakes, mice, and other animals that have bodies that are close to the ground.

“on the ground,” or “on land,”

so that they will abound on the earth 
“Then they will/can live/spread all over the earth/world”

and
“{yes,} they will”. The rest of verse 17 forms a parallelism with “abound on the earth” that emphasizes filling the earth again with animals. Make sure your translation does not sound like this refers to separate events. (See: figs-parallelism)

and his sons and his wife and the wives of his sons with him.
“and his sons, his wife, and his sons’ wives {went} with him.” or “along/together with his wife and his sons and their wives.” See how you translated this list of Noah’s family members (and similar lists) in Gen 6:18; 7:7, 13; 8:16. Notice that the order of the people in this list varies in the Hebrew text, perhaps depending on who is in focus in each context.


Gen 8:19 Every living thing, every crawling thing and every bird, everything moving on the earth, went out of the ark by their families.

Every living thing,

8:20-9:17 Yahweh Establishes His Covenant With Noah And His/Noah’s Descendants
  
Gen 8:20 Then Noah built an altar to Yahweh, and he took from every clean animal and from every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar. 

Then Noah built an altar 
“Then Noah built/made an altar {out of large stones}” or “Then Noah built/made a {sacrifice} table/mound {with large stones}”. An altar was an elevated, often table-shaped structure made out of stones where certain animals and crops were burned as sacrifices to God. (See: translate-key-terms)

to Yahweh, 
“{to offer sacrifices} to Yahweh,” or “{dedicated} to Yahweh,” or “to worship Yahweh,” 

and he
“Then/Next he”. Consider whether it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

took from every clean animal and from every clean bird,
“selected/chose {some/one} from/of every {kind of} clean/pure animal and {some/one of} every {kind of} clean/pure bird,” or “selected/chose {some/one} from/of every {kind of} animal and bird that are acceptable to sacrifice”. In the Bible, a “clean” animal or bird is one that is acceptable to be sacrificed to God or eaten; it does not refer to how clean the animal or bird was physically. See how you translated this term in Gen 7:2, 8.

and offered burnt offerings on the altar.
“and he {killed them and} offered/sacrificed them as burnt offerings {to Yahweh} on the altar.” or “and he {killed them and} burned {their bodies} on the altar as offerings/gifts {to Yahweh} {to worship/honor/thank him}.” Notice that animals were not burned alive, but were killed first. Consider whether or not you need to make that information explicit in your translation. (See: figs-explicit)


Gen 8:21 And Yahweh smelled the pleasant aroma, and Yahweh said in his heart, “Never again will I curse the ground because of mankind, though the inclination of mankind’s hearts {is} evil from their youth. And never again will I strike every living {thing} as I have done. 

And Yahweh smelled the pleasant aroma,
“Yahweh smelled the pleasant/sweet aroma/smell {of the sacrifices},” or “When Yahweh smelled the aroma {of the sacrifices}, he was pleased,”

and Yahweh
“and/so he”. Consider what is the best way to refer to Yahweh here in your language. (See: writing-pronouns)

said in his heart,
“said/thought to himself,” Consider whether your language has this idiom or a similar idiom that would work well here, or whether it is better to translate this without an idiom. (See: figs-idiom)

“Never again will I curse the ground 
“I will never again curse/devastate the ground/earth”. Make sure that your translation of “curse” does not imply the use of magic. (See: translate-key-terms)

because of mankind,
“because of mankind{’s sins},” or “to punish mankind {for their sins},”

though the inclination of mankind’s hearts {is} evil
“{even} though the intentions/desires of their hearts/minds/thinking {are} evil” or “{even} though everything they desire {is} evil”. See how you translated “inclination” in a similar phrase in Gen 6:5. (See: figs-idiom)

 “as I {just} did.” or “the way I {just} did.” 


Gen 8:22 While all of the days of the earth continue, seed time and harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night will not cease.”

While all of the days of the earth continue,
“As long as the earth {still} exists/lasts,” 

seed time
“seed-planting time/season” or “the time/season for planting seeds”

and harvest, 
“and harvest {time/season},” or “the time/season for harvesting/gathering {crops}”

and cold and heat, 
“cold {weather/season} and hot {weather/season},” These terms form a parallelism with “summer and winter”. If possible, it is best to keep both parts of the parallelism in your translation, since each part has a different emphasis. (See: figs-parallelism)

and summer and winter,
“summer and winter,” The seasons of summer and winter may be described differently depending on which part of the world your language area is located in. For example, some translations might use the terms “dry season” and “rainy/wet season”, depending on what best corresponds to summer and winter in that area. 

will not cease.”
“will never cease/stop.” or “will always continue {to happen/occur} {each year}.” It may be more natural to change the order of this sentence and say, “As long as the earth exists, {each year} there will always be a season/time to plant seeds and a season/time to harvest {crops}, as well as cold weather and hot weather, winter and summer, and day and night.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

Gen 9:1 Then God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth. 

Then God blessed Noah and his sons
“Then God showed favor to Noah and his sons” or “Then God caused Noah and his sons to prosper/flourish”. See how you translated “blessed” in Gen 1:22, 28.

and said to them,
“by saying to them,” or “by saying,” or “He said,” The phrase “blessed…and said” is a Hebrew expression that refers to one event and emphasizes it. It does not refer to two separate events. The words of the blessing are in verses 1-7. See how you translated this phrase in Gen 1:28. (See: writing-quotations)

“Be fruitful 
“Bear/Have many children” or “You will bear/have many children” (See: figs-idiom)

and multiply
“so that you {and your descendants} {will} multiply/increase {greatly} {in number}” or “so that you {and your descendants} {will} become {very} numerous/many”. See how you translated “be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth” in Gen 1:28. (See: grammar-connect-logic-goal)

and fill the earth.
“and fill the earth {with people}.” or “and inhabit the whole earth.” or “and live/spread all over the earth/world.”


Gen 9:2 And the fear of you and the dread of you will be on every living thing of the earth, including on every bird of the sky, on everything that moves on the ground, and on all the fish of the sea. Into your hand they are given. 

And the fear of you and the dread of you will be on every living thing of the earth,
“Every living thing/creature on the earth will be afraid and terrified of you,” or “All the animals on earth will be very/terribly afraid of you,” The phrase “the fear...and the dread” repeats the same idea in two different ways to emphasize how afraid the creatures were. For some languages it may be better to combine the phrase and say “very afraid/terrified”. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-doublet)

including on every bird
“including every bird” or “including all the birds”. The birds, moving creatures, and fish are all included in the general category of living creatures. 

of the sky,
“{that flies/fly} in the sky/air,” Consider again how you translated “birds of the sky” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 1:26, 28, 30; 2:19-20; 6:7; 7:3, 23; 9:2.

on everything that moves
“and every creature/animal that moves/lives” or “as well as all creatures/animals that move/live”

on the ground,
“on land,”

and on all the fish of the sea.
“and all the fish in the sea/ocean.”

Into your hand they are given.
“I have put them {all} under your authority.” or “I have put you in charge of them {all}.” The phrase “into your hand” means God was again giving mankind the responsibility to manage and control all the rest of what God had created. Consider whether your language has a similar idiom that would work well here. (See: figs-idiom)


Gen 9:3 Every moving creature that lives will be for you for food. Just as the green plants, I give you everything. 

Every moving creature that lives
“{From now on} every {kind of} living creature/thing that moves” or “{From now on} every creature/animal that is alive and moves”. See how you translated “every moving creature” in Gen 1:26, and see the note about that there. It may be necessary to translate this phrase in different ways in different contexts.

will be for you for food. 
“is yours {to eat} as food.” or “is available for you {to eat} as food.” For some languages it is more natural to change the order of this sentence and say, “You may {now} have/eat any {kind of} living creature that moves, for food.” or “{I now permit} you to eat every/any {kind of} living creature that moves.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

Just as
“Just as {in the past} {I gave/provided you}” or “In the same way that {I previously gave/provided you}”. The Hebrew text leaves the verb implied here. Decide whether or not to make it explicit in your language. (See: figs-ellipsis)

the green plants,
“green plants {for food},” or “plants {to eat},” Consider again how you translated “green plants” in Gen 1:30, and how you translated “plants” in Gen 1:11-12, 29; 2:5; 3:18; 9:3.

I give you everything.
“{now} I give/provide you everything {for food}.” or “{so now} I permit you to eat everything.” or “{so now} I permit you to eat both plants and animals.” Make sure that the way you translate this phrase means that God is now permitting people to eat both plants and animals.


Gen 9:4 But you must not eat flesh with its life, {that is,} its blood.

But
“However,” God is putting a limit on the way that people may eat meat. (See: grammar-connect-exceptions)

you must not eat flesh
“you must never eat {animal} flesh/meat”

with
“that still has”

its life, {that is,} its blood.
“its life {in it}, {which is in} its blood.” or “its blood {in it}, which made it live.” or “its lifeblood {in it}.” Since life is in the blood, God did not want people to eat meat that still had its blood in it, rather he wanted them to drain it out first before they cooked it (also see Deuteronomy 12:16, 23). You could put that information in a footnote.


Gen 9:5 And surely I will demand your blood for your lives. From the hand of every living thing I will demand it, and from the hand of mankind; from the hand of a man {who kills} his brother, I will demand the life of the man. 

And surely I will demand your blood for your lives.
“Also, I will definitely require an accounting/reckoning for your lifeblood.” or “Also, if {one of} you murders anyone, I definitely require that he must die.”

From the hand of every living thing
“From every/any animal {that kills a person}” or “{In fact,} if any animal {kills a human being},” In this verse, the phrase “the hand of” refers to the animal or the person that is responsible for killing someone. (See: figs-synecdoche)

I will demand it,
“I will demand/require its blood/life,” or “I require it to be killed,” or “I demand/require that it must die,”

and from the hand of mankind;
“{That is also true} for human beings:” or “and {that is also true} for human beings.” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

from the hand of a man {who kills}
“If a man/person {kills/murders}” or “If anyone {kills/murders}”

his brother,
“his/a fellow human being,” or “another person,” This phrase is used here as a general reference to any human being, not just biological brothers. (See: figs-synecdoche)

I will demand the life of the man. 
“I require him to be executed/killed.” or “I demand/require that he must die.”


Gen 9:6 The one shedding the blood of a man, by mankind his blood must be shed, because in the image of God he made mankind.

The one 
“{That’s right,} whoever” or “{Yes/Indeed,} if anyone/someone”. The first half of verse 6 repeats and summarizes verse 5.

shedding the blood of
“spills the blood of” or “kills/murders” or “takes the life of”. The phrase “sheds the blood of” is an idiom that means to deliberately kill someone. Blood is an important concept in this passage and throughout the Bible, so if possible it is best to keep this term in a translation. If that is not possible, you should put the literal text in a footnote. (See: figs-idiom) 

a man,
“a person,” or “another human being,” or “someone,” 

by mankind his blood must be shed, 
“people/you must execute him,” or “people/you must put him to death,” or “he must be executed,” For some languages it is more natural to put this clause first in this verse and say, “{That’s right,} you must put to death anyone who murders a human being, because {I,} God, made human beings in my own image.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure) 

because in the image of God he made mankind.
“because {I,} God made/created mankind/people in my {own} image.” or “because I created human beings to be like myself.” Make sure it is clear in your translation that God is referring to himself in this clause. See how you translated a similar clause in Gen 1:27.

____________________Paragraph Break____________________

Gen 9:7 “And you, be fruitful and multiply. Abound on the earth and multiply on it.”

And you,
“And/Now {as for} you,” or “As for you,” The pronoun “you” is an emphatic pronoun that is fronted here in the Hebrew text to introduce a new topic. Consider what is the best way in your language to begin a new paragraph like this.

be fruitful 
“bear/have many children”. See how you translated “be fruitful and multiply” in verse 1. (See: figs-idiom)

and multiply. 
“so that you {and your descendants} become {very} numerous/many.” or “so that you have many descendants.” 

Abound on the earth
“Spread out all over the earth” or “Live all over the earth”

and multiply
“and multiply/increase {in numbers}” or “and become numerous”

on it.”
“throughout it.” or “everywhere.”

Gen 9:8 Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him, saying, 

Then God said
“Then God continued speaking”

to Noah and to his sons with him, saying,
“to Noah and his sons {who were} with him, and said,” or “to Noah and his sons,” or “to them,” God is still speaking to the same people. This phrase emphasizes what he says next to them. (See: writing-quotations)


Gen 9:9 “And I, behold, I am establishing my covenant with you and with your offspring after you, 

“And I, behold,
“Now listen {carefully} to me:” or “Listen {carefully} to me,” See how you translated “behold” in Gen 1:29, 4:14, 6:13, 17. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.

I am establishing 
“I am making/instituting” or “I am setting up”. See how you translated “establish my covenant with” in Gen 6:18, and see the note about that there.

my covenant with you and with your offspring after you,
“my/a {special/peace} covenant/agreement with you and your offspring/descendants {who come/live} after you,” or “my/a covenant/agreement between me and you and your offspring/descendants,” Notice that the pronouns “you” and “your” are plural throughout verses 2-15, since God is speaking to Noah and his sons.


Gen 9:10 and with every living creature that {is} with you: with the birds, with the livestock, and with every living thing of the earth with you, from all that came out of the ark to every living thing of the earth.

and with 
“along with” or “{It is} also with” or “{The covenant/agreement is} also with”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to break up this long sentence and begin a new sentence here.

every living creature that {is} with you:
“all the living creatures that {are} with you:”

with the birds, with the livestock, 
“including the birds, the livestock,”

and with every living thing of the earth
“and all the {other} living things/creatures from/on the earth” or “and all the wild animals”

with you,
“{that are} with you,”

from all that came out of the ark to 
“{That includes} all {those} that came/went out of the ark and”. The words “from...to...” are used to emphasize that all the animals are included in God’s covenant. Consider what is the best way to express that in your language.

every living thing
“all the living things/creatures” or “all the creatures/animals”

of the earth.
“{that live} on the earth.” or “{that will ever live} on the earth.”


Gen 9:11 And I am establishing my covenant with you that never again will all flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood, and never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth.”

And I am establishing my covenant with you that
“My/The covenant/agreement that I am establishing/making/instituting with you is that”. See how you translated “my covenant” and “establish” in verse 9. (See: translate-key-terms)

never again will all flesh 
“never again will all life” or “never again will all living creatures/things”. The phrase “all flesh” refers here to all people and animals. (See: figs-synecdoche)

be cut off by
“be killed/destroyed by” or “be wiped out by” or “die from” (See: figs-activepassive)

the waters of a flood,
“water from a flood,” or “a flood,” See how you translated a similar phrase in Gen 7:10.

 and never again will there be a flood
“That’s right, never again will {I use/cause} a flood” or “{I promise that} I will never again use/cause a flood”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

and never again will waters become a flood to destroy
“that never again will there be a flood that destroys” or “{I promise/vow/pledge} that never again will I use/cause a flood to destroy”. Make sure it is clear in your translation that this last clause in verse 15 is what God promised in his covenant. Also, consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

“the sign {which shows} {that I promise to always keep} the covenant/agreement that I am establishing/making” or “how I will show/remind {everyone} that I have established/made/instituted this covenant/agreement/treaty”. See how you translated a similar clause in verse 12. In that verse God is explaining the rainbow for the first time, whereas here in verse 17, he is pointing back to what he just said about the rainbow in order to emphasize its importance. Also, consider again how you translated “covenant” in verses 9, 11-13, 15-17. (See: translate-key-terms)

9:18-29 Noah And His Three Sons After The Flood

Gen 9:18 And the sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem and Ham and Japheth; and Ham, he {was} the father of Canaan. 

And the sons of Noah
“Noah’s sons” or “{The names of} Noah’s sons”

“were Shem, Ham, and Japheth;” Consider what is the best way to list names in your language. 

and Ham, he 
“it was Ham who” or “Ham was the one who”. The pronoun “he” is emphatic here, emphasizing that Ham was the father of Canaan, who is probably mentioned here because he was well known as the ancestor of the Canaanites and the one whom the land/region of Canaan was named after.

{was} the father of Canaan.
“was Canaan’s father.” or “fathered Canaan.”


Gen 9:19 Those three {were} the sons of Noah, and from them the whole earth was overspread.

Those three {were} the sons of Noah, and from them the whole earth was overspread.
“It was from Noah’s three sons that the entire earth was populated {again}.” or “It was the descendants of Noah’s three sons who populated the entire earth {again}.” (See: figs-active passive)

Gen 9:20 Now Noah, a man of the soil, began and planted a vineyard. 

Now Noah,
“Now {later on,} Noah,” or “After a while, Noah,” or “Noah,” Consider what is the best way in your language to introduce or begin a new episode here. (See: writing-newevent)

a man of the soil, began and planted 
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) “{who was} a farmer, began/started {farming} and planted” or “{who was} a farmer, was the first {man/person} to plant” (2) “began {to be} a farmer” or “became a farmer and planted”

a vineyard.
“{some} grapevines {and made wine from the grapes}.” or “a field/garden with grapevines. {And he made wine from the grapes.}” It is implied that Noah made wine from the grapes (verse 21). If necessary, you could make that explicit here. Also, if grapes are not known in your language area, you could say “vines/plants with a fruit called grapes”, or you could put in a footnote information about grapes, including how they are squeezed and how the juice is fermented to make wine. (See: figs-explicit)


Gen 9:21 Then he drank some of the wine, and he became drunk, and he uncovered himself inside his tent. 

Then 
“Then {one day}” 

he drank some of the wine,
“he drank {too much of} the wine,” or “he drank a lot of the wine,”

and he became drunk, and he
“so that he got drunk and” or “so that he became so intoxicated/drunk that he”

uncovered himself 
“{fell asleep and} became uncovered/exposed” or “{fell asleep} uncovered/naked”. It is implied from verse 24 that Noah had fallen asleep. (See: figs-explicit)

inside his tent.
See how you translated “tent” in Gen 4:20.


Gen 9:22 Then Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and he told his two brothers outside. 

Then Ham, the father of Canaan,
“Ham, {who was} Canaan’s father,”

saw the nakedness of his father, 
“saw that his father was naked/uncovered,”

and he told his two brothers outside.
“and he went outside and told his two brothers {about it}.” or “and he went out and told his two brothers {that their father was drunk and naked}.”


Gen 9:23 But Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it across the shoulders of the two of them and walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father. And their faces were turned away, so that they did not see the nakedness of their father.

But Shem and Japheth
“However/Then Shem and Japheth”

took a garment,
“took a robe/cloak,” This garment would have probably been fairly large, big enough to cover Noah’s body.

and laid it across the shoulders of the two of them
“put it {between them} over their shoulders” or “held it {between them} at shoulder level”

and walked backward 
“and walked/went backward {into the tent}”

and covered the nakedness of their father. 
“and covered their father’s naked body {with it}.” or “and used it to cover their naked father.”

And their faces were turned away, 
“{As they did that,} they kept their faces/eyes turned/looking away {from him},” or “{As they did that,} they looked away {from him},”

so that they did not see 
“so that they would not see”

the nakedness of their father.
“his nakedness.” or “him naked.” Consider whether it is better here in your language to refer to Noah with a noun phrase or a pronoun. (See: writing-pronouns)

Gen 9:24 Then Noah woke up from his wine, and he learned what his youngest son had done to him, 

Then Noah 
“Later Noah/he”

woke up from his wine,
“woke up {sober} from {the effects of} the wine,” or “woke up from being drunk,” or “woke up sober,”

and he learned
“and he found out” or “and he heard {about}”. The text does not say how Noah found out about this, so it is best to not be too specific about that here in your translation.

what his youngest son had done to him,
“that his youngest son {Ham} had dishonored/disrespected/mocked him,”


Gen 9:25 and he said, “Cursed be Canaan! He will be a slave of slaves for his brothers.”

and he said
“So he exclaimed {about him/Ham},” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. (See: writing-quotations)

“Cursed be
“I {hereby} {ask God to} curse” or “May God curse”

Canaan!
“{Ham’s son} Canaan!” In verses 25-27, Canaan probably represents Ham and all of Ham’s descendants (the Canaanites), who will serve Shem and Japheth and all their descendants. You could put that information in a footnote.

He will be
“Canaan will be” or “{I declare/proclaim that} he/Canaan will be”

a slave of slaves
“the lowest slave/servant”. The Hebrew word here can mean either “slave” or “servant”. Slaves in the Old Testament were usually treated well and were not much different than servants, sometimes even becoming like members of their owner’s family. But they were of lower status than their masters, so that is part of how Ham’s family is being cursed.

“for his/Canaan’s relatives.” Verses 26 and 27 show that “his brothers” probably refers here to Shem and Japheth (who were Canaan’s uncles) and their descendants. 
 

Gen 9:26 Then he said, “Praised be Yahweh, the God of Shem! And may Canaan be a slave for him. 

Then he said,
“Then he/Noah {also} said,” or “He/Noah also said,” (See: writing-pronouns)

“Praised be Yahweh,
“Praise Yahweh,” or “I praise Yahweh,” Although many English translations have “Blessed be” here instead of “Praised be,” the word used in the Hebrew text means “praise” when people are acting towards God (as here), and it means “bless” when God is acting towards people (as in Gen 1:28; 5:2; 9:1). (See: translate-key-terms)

 the God of Shem!
“{who is} Shem’s God!” or “{who is} the God whom Shem worships/serves!” or “{who is} the God who takes care of Shem!”

 And may Canaan be 
“May he/God cause Canaan to be” or “May he/God make Canaan” or “I ask him/God to make Canaan”

“a servant for him/Shem.” or “his/Shem’s slave/servant.” 


Gen 9:27 May God enlarge Japheth, and may he live in the tents of Shem. And may Canaan be a slave for him.”

May God
“I {also} ask God to” or “I {also} pray that God will”
 
enlarge Japheth,
“enlarge/expand Japheth’s {territory},” or “make Japheth’s territory larger,” or “give Japheth more/much land,” (See: figs-metonymy)

and may he live 
“and enable him {and his family/descendants} to live”

Gen 9:28 And after the flood, Noah lived 350 years. 

And after the flood,
“After/From {the time that} the flood {began},” or “After/From {the beginning of} the flood,” Notice that this phrase refers to when the flood began, when Noah was 600 years old (Gen 7:6), not when it ended a year later, when he was 601 years old (8:13), since he was 950 when he died (verse 29), not 951. (See: figs-explicit)

Noah lived 350 years.
“Noah lived {another} 350 years.” or “Noah lived 350 {more} years.” 


Gen 9:29 So all the days of Noah were 950 years, and he died.

So all the days of Noah were 950 years,
“So Noah/he lived a total of 950 years,” or “So all together Noah lived 950 years,” See how you translated Gen 5:31, which is similar to 9:29.

“after the flood {was over/gone}.”


Japheth’s Descendants

Gen 10:2 The sons of Japheth {were} Gomer and Magog and Madai and Javan and Tubal and Meshech and Tiras.

The sons of Japheth {were}
“{The names of} Japheth’s sons {were}” or “These {were} {the names of} Japheth’s sons:” Throughout this chapter, many translations have a colon (:) instead of “were”. You could also use both. Do what is best in your language

Gomer and Magog and Madai and Javan and Tubal and Meshech and Tiras.

“the Kittites and the Dodanites.” or “the Kitt people {group} and the Dodan people {group}.” There are different ways to translate people group names, including: (1) Transliterate the Hebrew plural suffix “-im”. (2) Use a suffix that your language has for names of people groups, such as “-ites” in English. (3) Translate “-im” as “people” or “people group”. Try to be consistent in how you translate people group names throughout this chapter and rest of the book of Genesis. (See: translate-names)

Gen 10:5 From those the coastland peoples spread out into their lands, each with its own language, according to their clans, in their nations.

From those 
“From those/Japheth’s {descendants}”. This phrase probably refers to Japheth’s descendants (verses 2-4), especially since the descendants of his brothers Ham (verse 20) and Shem (verse 31) are summarized in a similar way.

the coastland peoples spread out into
“came the people groups who lived {in regions} near/beside the {Mediterranean} Sea. They moved to different places {and settled} in”

“and they formed/became their own people/ethnic groups.” or “which {grew/multiplied and} became their own {distinct} people/ethnic groups.” The word “nations” refers here to people groups, not countries. Also, for some languages it may be clearer to change the order of the phrases in this verse and say, “Japheth’s descendants spread out and settled near/by the {Mediterranean} Sea. They all formed their own family groups, which {grew/multiplied and} became their own people groups that spoke their own languages and lived in their own territories/regions.” Do what is best in your language.

Gen 10:20 Those {are} the sons of Ham according to their clans, according to their languages, in their lands, in their nations. 

Those {are} 
“Those {are/were} {the names of}” or “Those {men/people} {are/were}”. The word “Those” refers back to the people listed in verses 6-19. Also, many translations that use “were” (and other past tense verbs) in verses 2-19 and 21-30 use “are” here (and in verses 31 and 32). Do what is best in your language.

the sons of Ham
“the descendants of Ham” or “Ham’s sons/descendants”

according to their clans,
“according to their family groups,” or “and each one had his own clan/family,” or “and their {extended} families,” See how you translated “clans” in verse 5.

according to their languages, in their lands, in their nations.
“Each {clan/family} had/spoke its own language and {lived in} its own territory/region, and {eventually} became its own people group.” or “Each {clan/family} {grew/multiplied and} became/established its own people/ethnic group that had/spoke its own language and {lived in} its own territory/region.” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. See how you translated verse 5, which has some of the same phrases as verse 20.


Shem’s Descendants

Gen 10:21 And sons were also born to Shem; he {was} the father of all the sons of Eber and the brother of Japheth the elder. 

And sons were also born to Shem; 
“Shem also fathered/had {some} sons”. In the Hebrew text, “to Shem” comes first in this sentence after “And”, to emphasize Shem. Do what is natural in your language.

he {was} the father of all the sons of Eber 
“He was the ancestor of all the descendants of Eber”

and the brother of Japheth the elder.
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) “and his/Shem’s older brother was Japheth.” (2) “and he/Shem was Japheth’s older/oldest brother.”


Gen 10:22 The sons of Shem {were} Elam and Asshur and Arpachshad and Lud and Aram.

The sons of Shem {were} 
“{The names of} Shem’s sons {were}” or “These {were} {the names of} Shem’s sons:”

Elam and Asshur and Arpachshad and Lud and Aram.
Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud and Aram.” The name “Arpachshad” is spelled as “Arphaxad” in many translations. Also, see how you spelled “Lud” in verse 13 (who is a different person with the same name). Be consistent with how you spell each name throughout the Bible.

Gen 10:23 And the sons of Aram {were} Uz and Hul and Gether and Mash.

And the sons of Aram {were} 
“{The names of} Aram’s sons {were}” or “These {were} {the names of} Aram’s sons:”

Uz and Hul and Gether and Mash.
“Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.” The same person who is called “Mash” here, is referred to as “Meshech/Meshek” in 1 Chronicles 1:17. To prevent confusion, some translations use “Meshech/Meshek” here too, or put that name in a footnote.

Gen 10:24 And Arpachshad fathered Shelah, then Shelah fathered Eber. 

And Arpachshad fathered Shelah, 
“Arpachshad/Arphaxad fathered/had {a son named} Shelah,” Be consistent here with how you spelled “Arpachshad/Arphaxad” in verse 22.

then Shelah fathered Eber.
“then/and Shelah fathered/had {a son named} Eber.”


Gen 10:25 Then two sons were born to Eber. The name of the one {was} Peleg, because in his days the earth was divided. And the name of his brother {was} Joktan. 

Then two sons were born to Eber. 
“Then Eber fathered/had two sons.”

The name of the one {was}
“The name of the first {one/son} {was}” or “The first one/son was named”

Peleg,
“Peleg, {which means “division/divide,”}” You can put the meaning of Peleg’s name in the text or in a footnote, so that it is clear why he was given his name. See what you did for a similar case (Noah’s name) in Gen 5:29.

because in his days 
“because during his lifetime”

the earth was divided.
“{the people on} the earth divided/separated {into separate groups} {and scattered everywhere}.” This phrase refers to the people on the earth and implies that they scattered and lived all over the earth (as specified in Gen 11:8). (See: figs-metonymy)

And the name of his brother {was} Joktan.
“His/Peleg’s {younger} brother’s name was Joktan.” or “{Eber’s second/other son} was named Joktan and was younger than Peleg.” Make sure it is clear in your translation who is being referred to in this sentence, especially after reading the previous two sentences. (See: writing-pronouns)


Gen 10:26 And Joktan fathered Almodad and Sheleph and Hazarmaveth and Jerah

And Joktan fathered 
“Joktan fathered/had {sons named}” or “Joktan fathered/had {the following sons:}” Notice that the list of Joktan’s sons continues through verse 29.

Almodad and Sheleph and Hazarmaveth and Jerah
“Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,”


Gen 10:27 and Hadoram and Uzal and Diklah

“Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab.” Consider again how you translated lists of names throughout chapter 10.

 All those {were} 
“All those {were} {the names of}” or “All those {men/people} {were}” or “Those {were} all”

the sons of Joktan.
“Joktan’s sons.” 


Gen 10:30 And their dwelling was from Mesha, {then} you go to Sephar, the mountain{s} of the east.

And their dwelling
“Their dwelling {place}” or “Their territory/region” or “The region/area where they lived”

was from Mesha,
“extended/reached from {the city of} Mesha {in the west},” See how you translated a similar sentence in verse 19. (See: figs-explicit)

{then} you go to 
“all the way to” or “as far as”

Sephar,
“{the city/town of} Sephar, {which is in/near}”. Sephar might refer to a city, a mountain, or a region (that was named after the city or mountain).

the mountain{s} of the east.
“the mountain range {that is} in the east.” or “the hill country in the east.” or “the eastern hill country.” The word “mountain{s}” is ambiguous in the Hebrew text. It can be (1) a collective noun that refers to mountains or hill country near the town of Sephar (2) a singular noun that refers to a specific mountain that was called Sephar.

11:1-9 The Tower Of Babel

Gen 11:1 Now the whole earth was one language and the same words.

Now
“Now {at first,}” or “Now {for a while,}” The events in chapter 11:1-9 happened before the people listed in chapter 10 had their own languages and before they spread out over the earth (Gen 10:5, 19-20, 30-32). You could include some of that information in a footnote. (See: grammar-connect-time-background)

the whole earth
“all {the people on} the earth” or “everyone on the earth” (See: figs-metonymy)

was one language
“had/spoke one language” or “spoke/shared the same language”

and the same words.
“and {spoke/shared} the same words/vocabulary.” or “and spoke words everyone knew/understood.” or “so everyone understood each other.” The phrases “one language” and “the same words” are very similar in meaning and emphasize the fact that everyone spoke the same language. Consider the best way to communicate that in your language. (See: figs-doublet)


Gen 11:2 And it happened as they migrated from the east, then they found a plain in the land of Shinar and settled there. 

And it happened as 
“After a while, as/when” or “As/When” or “As time passed,” The phrase “it happened that” introduces an important event and helps create suspense so that readers will wonder what the outcome will be. Some translations omit this phrase because it is not natural in their language. Do what is best in your language. (See: writing-newevent)

they migrated 
“they moved/traveled” or “the people migrated/moved”. Consider whether it is better in your language to use a pronoun (“they”) or a noun phrase (“the people”) here. (See: writing-pronouns)

from the east,
“from the eastern {regions},” or “{around} in the eastern {regions},” At first after the flood, people lived in the regions around the mountains of Ararat (where the ark had landed). As they began to migrate and spread out to different places (as God had told them to do), they must have headed south at some point, since they ended up at the plain of Shinar, which was south of where the Ararat Mountains were. The reference to “the east” probably reflects the viewpoint of the author (Moses), since the Ararat mountains and the plain of Shinar were both far to the east of where he was living.

then they found
“they discovered” or “they {eventually} came to” or “and {eventually} came to”. Make sure the way you translate this phrase fits with the way you translated the first half of this verse.

a plain in the land of Shinar 
“a wide/spacious, flat valley/area in the land/region called Shinar”. This plain was a wide, flat area between mountains. Also be consistent here with how you translated “land of Shinar” in Gen 10:10.

and settled there.
“and lived/stayed there.” or “and began to live there.”


Gen 11:3 Then they said to each other, “Come, let us make bricks and bake them with fire.” And they had bricks for stones, and they had tar for mortar. 

Then they said to each other, 
“Then {one day} they urged each other,” The events that are described below probably did not happen immediately after they arrived at the plain. Consider what is the best way to begin these events in your language. (See: writing-new event)

“Come, 
“Come on,” Consider whether or not your language has an idiom like this that is used to urge or persuade someone to do something together. (See: figs-idiom)

let us make 
“let us {work together and} make” or “we should {work together and} make”. The pronoun “us” is inclusive here and refers to the people who are talking to each other. (See: figs-exclusive)

bricks
“{some} {clay/mud} bricks/blocks” or “{some} bricks/blocks {from clay/mud}” (See: figs-explicit)

and bake them with fire.” 
“and harden them with fire.” or “and use fire to bake/harden them.” or “and put/bake them in/over fire {to make them hard/strong}.”

And they had 
“So {they did that, and} they had” or “They had/used” 

bricks for stones,
“bricks/blocks {to build with} instead of stone,”

and they had tar
“and they used tar {between the bricks/blocks}”

“Come,
“Come on,” See how you translated this idiom in verse 3.

“let us {work together and} build” or “we should {work together and} build”. See how you translated a similar phrase in verse 3.

a city for ourselves
“a city for us {to live in}”

and let us make a name for ourselves, so that we are not scattered
“{We should do that} to make ourselves famous and to keep us from spreading out” or “{That way} we will become well-known/famous, and we will not separate from each other {and live}”. The phrase “make a name for ourselves” is a idiom. Consider whether or not your language has a similar idiom that would work well here. Also see how you translated the word “scattered” in Gen 10:18, 32. (See: figs-idiom)

“And/Then he said (to himself),” or “He said,” Consider what is the best way to refer to Yahweh here in your language. (See: writing-pronouns)

“Behold,
“Look,” This term calls attention to what Yahweh says next. Consider what is the best way to do that in your language.

“nothing that they plan to do will be impossible for them.” or “everything/anything they plan/attempt to do will be possible for them.” or “they will be able to do anything/whatever they plan/try to do.” The words “not” and “impossible” are two negatives that work together to communicate an emphatic positive statement. Consider what is the best way to translate this in your language. (See: figs-doublenegatives)


Gen 11:7 Come, let us go down and there confuse their language, so that they will not understand each other’s language.” 

Come,
“{So} come on,” or “{So}”

let us 
“we must”. Most Bible scholars think this plural pronoun refers here to God and the fact that he is three Persons in one God. So it is best to keep this plural pronoun in your translation. See what you did for similar pronouns in Gen 1:26.

go down and there 
“go down there {now} and” or “go to them and”

confuse their language
“scramble their language” or “mix up their language”

so that they will not understand
“so that they will not {be able to} understand” or “so that they cannot understand”

“caused the people to leave from there and spread out” or “caused the people to leave from there and settle/live in different places” 

over the face of the whole earth,
“over the surface of the entire earth,” or “all over the earth/world,” (See: figs-idiom)

and they
“so that they”

stopped building
“had to stop building/constructing”

the city.
“the city {and the tower}.” For some languages it is better to change the order of clauses in this verse (so that events are in the order that they happened) and say, “In that way, Yahweh caused the people to stop building the city {and the tower} and to move away from each other, {so that eventually they lived} all over the world.” Do what is best in your language.

Gen 11:9 For that {reason} they called its name Babel, because there Yahweh confused the language of the whole earth, and from there Yahweh scattered them over the face of the whole earth. 

For that {reason} 
“That is why”

they called its name 
“people named the/that city” or “the name of the/that city is” or “the/that city was named/called”. Frequently in the Hebrew text, this phrase has a general meaning and does not refer to someone specific.

Babel, 
“Babel, {which means “confused/mixed-up/scrambled,”}” If you include the meaning of “Babel” here in your translation or in a footnote, be consistent with the way you translate “confused” later in this verse and in verse 7.

“This/Here is the record/list of Shem’s descendants:” or “This is Shem’s genealogy/family-line:”

Shem {was} the son of 100 years, then he fathered Arpachshad two years after the flood.
“Two years after the flood {began}, when Shem was 100 years old, he had {a son named} Arpachshad/Arphaxad.” The phrase “after the flood” probably refers to two years after the flood began, not after it ended; see a similar case in Gen 9:28. Also be consistent here with how you spelled “Arpachshad/Arphaxad” in Gen 10:22. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 11:11 Then after he fathered Arpachshad, Shem lived 500 years, and he fathered {other} sons and daughters.

Throughout this section, make sure that names and pronouns (like “he”) are used in a way that is accurate and natural in your language, so that it is always clear who is being referred to. (See: writing-pronouns)

500 years, 
“{another} 500 years,” or “500 {more} years,” See how you translated Gen 5:7, which has the same sentence structure as 11:11. For some languages, it may be more natural to change the clause order of this sentence and say, “Shem lived 500 {more} years after Arpachshad/Arphaxad was born,...” Do what is best in your language throughout this chapter.

“he fathered/had {a son named} Nahor.” or “he fathered/had {a son whose name was} Nahor.” 


Gen 11:23  Then after he fathered Nahor, Serug lived 200 years, and he fathered {other} sons and daughters.

Then after he fathered Nahor, Serug lived
“After he/Serug had Nahor, Serug/he lived” or “After Nahor was born, Serug lived” or “After Nahor’s birth, Serug lived”. Be consistent with how you spell the name “Serug” in Gen 11:20-23. (See: translate-names)

“{another} 200 years,” or “200 {more} years,” 

and he fathered 
“and he {also} fathered/had” or “He/Serug was {also} the father of”

{other} sons and daughters.
“{other} sons, as well as daughters.”


Gen 11:24  And Nahor lived 29 years, then he fathered Terah. 

And Nahor lived 29 years, then
“When Nahor had lived 29 years,” or “When Nahor was 29 years old,”

he fathered Terah. 
“he fathered/had {a son named} Terah.” or “he fathered/had {a son whose name was} Terah.” Consider again how you translated verses 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, and 24, which all have the same sentence structure.


Gen 11:25  Then after he fathered Terah, Nahor lived 119 years, and he fathered {other} sons and daughters.

Then after he fathered Terah, Nahor lived
“After he/Nahor had Terah, Nahor/he lived” or “After Terah was born, Nahor lived” or “After Terah’s birth, Nahor lived” (See: writing-pronouns)

119 years, 
“{another} 119 years,” or “119 {more} years,”

and he fathered 
“and he {also} fathered/had” or “He/Nahor was {also} the father of”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

{other} sons and daughters.
“{other} sons, as well as daughters.” Consider again how you translated verses 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23 and 25, which all have the same sentence structure.


Gen 11:26  And Terah lived 70 years, then he fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran. 

And Terah lived 70 years, then 
“After Terah had lived 70 years,” or “After Terah was/turned 70 years old,” Your translation needs to allow for the fact that Terah’s sons were not triplets (just as Noah’s sons were not triplets; see Gen 5:32), rather he started having children after he turned 70 and his sons were born in different years after that. In fact, Abram was not born until Terah was at least 130 years old (11:32, 12:4-5; Acts 7:4), and he was probably Terah’s youngest son. Abram is listed first (instead of Haran or Nahor) probably because of his importance as the one whom Yahweh made His covenant with. Some of this information could be put in a footnote.

he fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
“he fathered/had {sons named} Abram, Nahor, and Haran.” or “he fathered/had {sons whose names were} Abram, Nahor, and Haran.”


11:27-32 Terah’s Children, Including Abram

Gen 11:27  Now these {are} the generations of Terah: Terah fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran fathered Lot. 

Now these {are} the generations of Terah: 
“Here/This {is} the history/account/record about/of Terah and his descendants:” This section is different from the previous section. What follows is a history about Terah’s descendants (especially Abram); it is not a genealogy or list of names. See how you translated a similar phrase in Gen 6:9.

Terah fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran; 
“Terah fathered/had {sons named} Abram, Nahor, and Haran;” or “Terah’s sons were Abram, Nahor, and Haran.”

and Haran fathered Lot.
“and Haran fathered/had {a son named} Lot.” or “Haran’s son {was named} Lot.” or “and Haran had a son {whose name was} Lot.”


Gen 11:28  Later Haran died in the presence of Terah his father, in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Kasdim. 

Later Haran died in the presence of Terah his father, 
“Later Haran died while he was with his father Terah,” or “While his father Terah was still alive, Haran died”

in the land of his birth, 
“in the land where he was born,” or “in his native land,”

in Ur of the Kasdim.
“in {the city of} Ur which was ruled/inhabited by the Kasdim/Chaldeans.” or “in {the city of} Ur where the Kasdim/Chaldea people lived.” The word “Kasdim” probably comes from the name of one of Nahor’s sons, Kesed (Gen 22:22), and often refers to the Chaldeans who were a people group that lived in the country of Babylonia (where Ur was located). 
 

Gen 11:29  And Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves. The name of Abram’s wife {was} Sarai, and the name of Nahor’s wife {was} Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah and the father of Iscah. 

And Abram and Nahor
“Meanwhile Abram and Nahor” or “Abram and Nahor”

took wives for themselves.
“each married a wife.” or “each got married.”

 The name of Abram’s wife {was} Sarai, 
“Abram’s wife was named Sarai,”

and the name of Nahor’s wife {was} Milcah,
“and Nahor’s wife was Milcah.”

 the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah and the father of Iscah.  
“She/Milcah was the daughter of {his/Nahor’s brother} Haran, who was the father of {both} Milcah and {her sister} Iscah.” or “Milcah and {her sister} Iscah were Haran’s daughters.”


Gen 11:30  But Sarai was barren; she did not have a child.

But Sarai was barren; 
“But/Now Sarai was unable to conceive,” or “Sarai was not able to become/get pregnant,” Consider what is the best way in your language to introduce this background information about Sarai. (See: writing-background)

she did not have a child.
“{so} she did not have any children.” or “{so} she had no children.” For some languages it may be better to switch the order of the clauses in this verse and say, “But/Now Sarai did not have any children, because she was not able to conceive.” Do what is best in your language.

12:1-9 God Calls Abram

 Gen 12:1 Then Yahweh said to Abram, “You yourself must go from your land and from your relatives and from the house of your father, to the land that I will show you. 

Then
“Then {one day}” or “{One day}”. Consider the best way to begin this new section in your language. (See: writing-newevent)

Yahweh said to Abram,
“Yahweh told/commanded Abram,” (See: writing-quotations)

“You yourself must go from 
“Get yourself away from” or “You must move away from” or “You must leave {behind}” 

your land 
“your homeland/country” or “the land/country where you are living”

and from your relatives 
“and your relatives/people, 

and from the house of your father,
“including your father’s household/family,” (See: figs-metonymy)

 to the land 
“{and go/move} to the land”

that I will show you. 
“that I will guide you to.”


Gen 12:2 And I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you, and I will make your name great, and you must be a blessing.”

And I will make you into 
“I will make you {and your descendants} become” or “I will make you {the father/ancestor of}”

a great nation, 
“an important/large people group,” or “a large, important people/ethnic group,”

and I will bless you,
“and I will bless/prosper you {and them}.” or “and I will cause you {all} to prosper/flourish.” See how you translated “blessed” in Gen 1:22, 28. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.

and I will make your name great, 
“I will make you {important and} well-known/famous,” Consider what is the best way to translate this idiom in your language. Also consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. (See: figs-idiom)

and you must be a blessing.”
“and you will be a blessing {to many people}.” or “and you {and your descendants} will bless {many people}.” or “and {I will use} you {and your descendants} to bless {many people}.” (See: figs-explicit)


Gen 12:3 And I will bless those who bless you, but whoever curse you I will curse. And in you all the families of the earth will be blessed.”

And I will bless those who bless you, 
“I will bless everyone who blesses you,” 

but whoever curses you I will curse.
“but I will curse anyone who curses you.” See how you translated “curse” in Gen 8:21.

And in you
“Through you {and your offspring/descendants}” or “Because of you {and your offspring/descendants}” or “By means of you {and your offspring/descendants}”. This phrase refers to Abram and his descendants, including ultimately the Messiah. In other words, God’s promise in this verse is part of his wonderful news (the Gospel message) for all people (Galatians 3:8-9) and is a prophecy about the Messiah/Christ, who was one of Abraham's descendants (Matthew 1:1, Genesis 22:18, Galatians 3:16). God blessed all people on earth by sending his Son Jesus (the Messiah/Christ) to die in their place and pay for all their sins (John 3:16-18, 1 Timothy 2:3-6), so that they could have a close relationship with him/God and be part of his family forever. God repeats this great promise in Genesis 18:18; 22:18; 26:4; 28:14. You could put some of that information in a footnote. (See: figs-metonymy)

all the families of the earth will be blessed.
“all the families/people on the earth will be blessed {by me}.” or “{I} will bless all the families/people on the earth.” Consider what is the best way in your language to translate this passive sentence. For some languages it is clearer to change the order of the sentence and say, “I will use you {and your offspring/descendants} to bless all the families/people on the earth.” Do what is best in your language.

Gen 12:4 Then Abram went, just as Yahweh had told him, and Lot went with him. And Abram was the son of 75 years when he departed from Haran.

Then 
“So”. Consider what is the best way in your language to begin this sentence to show that Abram is now doing what God just commanded him to do (verse 1). (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)

Abram went, just as Yahweh had told him, 
“Abram left {the city of Haran}, just/exactly as Yahweh had told/commanded him {to do},” or “Abram did/obeyed what Yahweh had told/commanded him {to do} and left {the city of Haran},”

Gen 12:5 And Abram took Sarai his wife and Lot the son of his brother and all their possessions that they had accumulated and the people whom they had acquired in Haran, and they set out to go to the land of Canaan. Then they came to the land of Canaan.

And Abram 
“Abram/He” (See: writing-pronouns)

took Sarai his wife 
“took/brought {with him} his wife Sarai”. Be consistent here with how you spelled “Sarai” in Gen 11:29-31. (See: figs-go)

and Lot the son of his brother
“and his {deceased} brother’s son Lot” or “and his nephew Lot”. For some languages it is more natural to make “son of his brother” or “his nephew” explicit in verse 4 (where Lot is first mentioned in this section) and leave it implied here in verse 5. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-explicit)

and all their possessions that they had accumulated and the people whom they had acquired
“everything that they owned, including slaves/servants {and everything else} they had acquired/gotten”. The word “possessions” is general here and includes slaves, animals, furniture, clothes, and money. See how you translated “slave” or “servant” in Gen 9:25-27.

“in {the city of} Haran,” or “in Haran {City}

Then they came to the land of Canaan.
“Then/Eventually they arrived in Canaan.” or “When they reached Canaan,” or “When they arrived/got there,”


Gen 12:6 Then Abram passed through the land as far as the place of Shechem to the terebinth tree of Moreh. And the Canaanites {were} in the land at that time. 

Then Abram 
“Abram” or “Abram {and his family}” or “they”. Abram is the only one named here because he is in focus. However, your translation should not sound like he traveled alone in verse 6. Also make sure that the way you begin this verse in your translation fits with the way you ended verse 5. (See: figs-metonymy)

passed through 
“traveled/went through”

the land
“that land/region”. See how you translated “land” in verse 5.

as far as 
“until they arrived at” or “to”

the place of Shechem 
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) “the city of Shechem” (2) “the/a {sacred} place at/near {the city of} Shechem” 

to the terebinth tree of Moreh. 
“to Moreh’s terebinth/oak tree.” or “to the terebinth/oak tree on Moreh’s land.” Moreh is probably the name of the person who owned the land where the terebinth tree was. A terebinth tree is a large, broadleaf, flowering tree in the cashew family that can grow to a height of 5 to 12 meters (16 to 40 feet). The Hebrew words for “oak” and “terebinth” are similar, so many translations (including LXX) translate this as “oak tree” here. Notice, however, that oak trees and terebinth trees are from two different tree families. (See: translate-unknown)

And the Canaanites {were} in the land at that time. 
“At/During that time the Canaanites {were still living} in that land/region,” For some languages it is clearer and more natural to put the time phrase (“at that time”) first in this sentence. (See: figs-infostructure)
 

Gen 12:7 Then Yahweh appeared to Abram and said, “To your offspring I will give this land.” So he built an altar there to Yahweh, who had appeared to him.

Then
“but”. Yahweh’s promise in verse 7 to give Canaan to Abram’s descendants contrasts with the fact that the Canaanites were still occupying that region (verse 6). (See: grammar-connect-logic-contrast)

Yahweh appeared to Abram
“Yahweh came to Abram” or “Yahweh visited Abram”. The text does not specify in what form or in what way God appeared to Abram, so your translation should not do that either.

and said, 
“and said/promised {to him},” (See: writing-quotations)

“To your offspring I will give this land.”
“I will give this land to your offspring/descendants.” In the Hebrew text, the phrase “to your offspring” is emphasized by its position at the beginning of this quote. However, for some languages it may be clearer and more natural to change the order of the clauses and say, “I will give this land to your offspring/descendants.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

So he
“So/Then he/Abram”. Make sure that your translation of this phrase refers to Abram. (See: writing-pronouns)

“{south} toward” or “{southward} until they reached”

the Negev.
“the Negev/Southern {Wilderness/Desert}.” The Hebrew word “Negev” can mean “south” or “dry country,” so some translations translate the meaning. But most translations transliterate the Hebrew name (as “Negev” or “Negeb”) as they do with other names in the Bible. (See: translate-names)


12:10-20 Abram And Sarai Go To Egypt

Gen 12:10 Then there was a famine in the land, so Abram went down to Egypt to sojourn there, because the famine {was} heavy in the land. 

Then there was 
“Now there was”. This clause gives the setting for the rest of the sentence. Translate this in a way that is natural in your language.

a famine 
“a serious/extreme shortage/lack of food” or “a hungry/starving time when food was very/extremely scarce”. A “famine” is a prolonged period of time when people are starving because crops are failing, often due to a lack of rain or other severe weather conditions.

“in that land/region/area,” or “in the Negev Wilderness/Desert,”

so Abram 
“so Abram {and his family}”

went down
“headed/traveled southwest” or “went/traveled/moved {further} south”. This phrase refers to the fact that Egypt is lower in elevation than Canaan (verse 5). It is also located southwest of Canaan.

to sojourn there, 
“to live/stay there for a while,”

because the famine {was} heavy 
“because the food shortage was {very} severe/oppressive”

“in that land/region.” or “in the Negev {Wilderness/Desert} {so they could not survive/live there}.” It may be more natural to put this clause near the beginning of this verse and say, “Then/Now there was a famine in that land/region that was so heavy/severe/bad that Abram {and his family} {left there and} went down to {the land/country of} Egypt to live for a while.” Do what is best in your language.

Gen 12:12 So it will happen when the Egyptians see you, then they will say, ‘This {is} his wife,’ and they will kill me but let you live. 

So it will happen when 
“So when” or “When”. Consider whether it is better in your language to begin this sentence with or without a conjunction (“So”). (See: grammar-connect-logic-result)

the Egyptians 
“the people of/in Egypt”

see you,
“see/notice you {with me},”

then they will say, ‘This {is} his wife,’ 
“they will say/know that you are my wife,” Consider whether it is better in your language to translate this embedded quote as a direct or indirect quote. (See: figs-quotations)

Please say
“{So} please tell {people/them}”

“ ‘I am his/Abram’s sister,’ ” Consider whether an indirect quote or direct quote is best here in your language. (See: figs-quotations)

so that it will go well for me 
“so that I will be treated well” or “so that they/people will treat me well”

for your sake
“because of you”

 and my life will live because of you.”
“and my life will be spared {by them}.” or “and they will spare my life.” or “and {they will} let me live.” For some languages it is not natural to include the phrase “because of you” here, because it repeats the same idea as “for your sake” that was earlier in the sentence. Do what is best in your language.

And the officials of Pharaoh saw her, so 
“{Some of} the officials/officers who served/ruled under the {Egyptian} king/ruler noticed/spotted her, so” or “When some officials/officers of/under Pharaoh {the king of/over Egypt} saw/noticed her,” The term “officials” is general and refers to leaders or rulers who were under Pharaoh and served him. Also, the term “Pharaoh” is a title that refers to the king or ruler over Egypt. However, in the Old Testament, it is treated as a name (that frequently occurs with the title “king of Egypt”), so translators often transliterate “Pharaoh” (which is how other names in the Bible are normally treated). Decide how you will handle this in your translation. (See: translate-names)

they praised her to Pharaoh,
“they told Pharaoh/him how beautiful she was,” or  “they highly recommended her to him,” (See: writing-pronouns)

“But/Then Yahweh struck/afflicted the king and {the people in} his household/family” or ”Then Yahweh caused {King} Pharaoh and {the people} in his household/family to get/be very sick”. See how you translated “Pharaoh” in verse 15. You could translate it differently in different contexts. Do what is clear and natural in your language in each context.

{with} great plagues 
“{with} severe/terrible diseases/illnesses”

on account of Sarai the wife of Abram.
“because of Sarai, Abram’s wife.” or “because he/Pharaoh had taken Abram’s wife Sarai.” For many languages it is clearer and more natural to put this clause first in this verse and say, “But since {King} Pharaoh had taken Abram’s wife Sarai, Yahweh afflicted the king and his family {with} severe illnesses.” Do what is best in your language (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 12:18 So Pharaoh called for Abram and said, “What {is} this you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she {was} your wife? 

So Pharaoh
“So/Then Pharaoh/he” or “So/Then the king” or “So/Then {King} Pharaoh”

called for Abram
“sent for Abram {to come to him}” or “summoned Abram {before him}”

and said, 
“and said {to him},” or “and asked {him},” Make sure that the way you translate this quote margin fits with the way that you translate the following quote. (See: writing-quotations)

“What {is} this you have done to me?
“Why have you treated me so badly?” or “You have treated me very badly!” Pharaoh uses rhetorical questions in verses 18 and 19 to express his anger at what Abram had done; he does not expect Abram to answer him. Some languages must use statements or exclamations here instead. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-rquestion)

 Why did you not tell me that she {was} your wife?
“You should have told/informed me that she/Sarai {is} your wife!” (See: figs-rquestion)


Gen 12:19 Why did you say, ‘She {is} my sister,’ so that I took her to me as a wife? Now then, behold your wife. Take her and go!” 

Why did you say, ‘She {is} my sister,’ 
“Why did you say/pretend that she {is} your sister,” or “You should not have said/pretended that she {is} your sister,” Pharaoh uses this rhetorical question to scold Abram and express his anger at him. Consider the best way to do that in your language. Also consider whether it is better in your language to translate this embedded quote as a direct or indirect quote. (See: figs-rquestion)

so that I took her to me as a wife?
“so that I took/chose her to be a/my wife!” or “so that I ended up taking her to be my wife!” or “I believed you and took her to be my wife!” For some languages it is clearer and more natural to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language. (See: grammar-connect-logic-result)

Now then,
“Now therefore,” or “So now,”

behold your wife. 
“here is your wife {back}.” or “look, I’m giving your wife back to you.”

Take {her} and go!”
“Take {her} and leave {my country}!”


Gen 12:20 Then Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him, and they sent him away and his wife and everything that {belonged} to him.

Then Pharaoh 
“Then {King} Pharaoh“ or “Then the {Egyptian} king” or “Then the king {of/over Egypt}”. Consider again how you translated “Pharaoh” in verses 15-18, 20. It may be helpful to read this section aloud to make sure it is clear and natural in your language.

commanded 
“ordered” or “gave orders to”

his men
“{some of} his men/soldiers”

concerning him,
“concerning/about him/Abram,” or “to make sure that Abram left,” Throughout this verse, make sure it is clear in your translation who is being referred to. (See: writing-pronouns)

and they sent him away 
“and/so they forced him to leave {the/their country},” or “and/so they expelled him {from Egypt},” (See: grammar-connect- logic-result)

and his wife 
“along with his wife”

and everything that {belonged} to him.
“and all that he/they had/owned.” or “all his/their possessions.” This included Abram’s slaves, animals, and everything else that he owned.

22:1-19 God Tests Abraham’s Faith

Gen 22:1 Then it happened after those things that God tested Abraham. And he said to him, “Abraham!” And he said, “Behold me.”

Then it happened after those things that 
“Sometime after those things happened” or “Sometime later” or “Several years later”. This is the beginning of a new episode that takes place as many as twelve years after Abraham and King Abimelech made their treaty (chapter 21). See how you translated “after those events” in Gen 15:1; it may be necessary to translate this phrase slightly differently here because of the context. (See: writing-newevent)

God tested Abraham. 
“God {wanted/decided to} test Abraham.” Make sure your translation of this clause does not sound like the test was over. Rather it introduces what the following episode is about.

And he said to him, “Abraham!”
“So {one day} he called to him, “Abraham!” ” or “He called to him, “Abraham!” ” or “{This is what happened:} He/God called to him, “Abraham!” ” 

And he said,
“Abraham replied/responded {to him},” Make sure the way you translate this quote margin fits the context well. (See: writing-quotations)

“Behold me.”
“I’m listening, {Lord/Master}.” or “Yes, {Lord/Master}?” or “What is it, {Lord/Master}?” Abraham’s reply is respectful and means that he is listening and ready to do what God wants him to do. Consider what is the best way to say this in your language. (See: figs-idiom)


Gen 22:2 Then he said, “Please take your son, your only {son} whom you love, Isaac, and go yourself to the land of Moriah and sacrifice him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains that I will tell to you.”

Then he said, 
“Then God said {to him},” or “Then God commanded/told {him},” Translate this quote margin in a way that fits this context well. (See: writing-quotations)

“Please take your son, 
“Take your son {with you},” See how you translated “please” when God is talking to a person in Gen 13:14; 15:5. Your translation of “take” here should not imply the use of force. See how you translated “took” in Gen 11:31; 12:5.

your only {son} whom you love, Isaac, 
“{yes/indeed,} your only {son} Isaac whom you love,” This phrase repeats part of the previous phrase in order to emphasize it. Do what is natural in your language.

and go yourself 
“and go/travel {with him}”. It is understood that he was to take Isaac with him. If this is not clear in your language, you could make that information explicit. (See: figs-explicit)

to the land of Moriah
“to the region of/called Moriah” or “to the Moriah Region” (See: translate-names)

and sacrifice him there as a burnt offering
“and sacrifice/offer him there {to me} as a burnt offering” or “There you are to burn him up {on an altar} as a sacrifice/offering {to me},” See how you translated a similar phrase in Gen 8:20.

on one of the mountains
“on {top of} one of the mountains” or “on {top of} a mountain” 

that I will tell to you.”
“that I will show to you.” or “that I will point out to you.”

Gen 22:3 So Abraham got up early in the morning and saddled his donkey. Then he took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son, and he cut wood for the burnt offering. Then he got up and left for the place that God had told to him.

So Abraham got up early in the morning 
“So the next morning, Abraham got up early” or “Early the next morning Abraham got up”. See how you translated “got up early in the morning” in Gen 20:8.

and saddled his donkey.
“put a {pack} saddle on his donkey {to get it ready} {for the trip}.” or “and got his donkey ready {for the trip}.” A donkey is like a small horse that people used to carry loads (as here). (See: translate-unknown)

Then he took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son, 
“He took/brought two of his servants with him and his son Isaac” or “Then he took/got his son Isaac and two of his servants”

and he cut wood 
“and he chopped/split {some} {fire}wood {with them}” or “and they chopped {some} {fire}wood {together}”. The reason Abraham is the only one mentioned in this clause and in the next sentence is that he is in focus. He did not travel alone and he probably did not chop the wood alone. Decide whether you need to make that explicit in your translation. (See: figs-explicit)

for the burnt offering.
“{to use} for the burnt offering {and loaded it on the donkey}.” or “that they would use to burn the sacrifice/offering {and loaded it on the donkey}.” Some languages must translate this noun phrase using a verb. Do what is natural in your language. See what you did in verse 2. (See: figs-abstractnouns)

Then he got up and left for the place
“Then he set out {with them} for/toward the place/mountain” or “Then they started traveling toward/to the place/mountain”. In this context, “got up” is used as an idiom that means Abraham started an activity. It does not mean that he was sitting down and literally stood up. (See: figs-idiom)

that God had told to him. 
“that God had told/commanded him/Abraham {to go to}.”


Gen 22:4 On the third day Abraham lifted his eyes and he saw the place from a distance.

On the third day
“Three days later,” or “After walking/traveling for three days,”

Abraham lifted his eyes
“Abraham/he looked ahead”. See how you translated the idiom “lifted his eyes” in Gen 18:2. It may be necessary to translate it differently here, because of the different context. (See: figs-idiom)

and he saw the place from a distance.
“and he could see the place/mountain {where they were headed} in the distance.” or “and in the distance he could see the place/mountain {where they were headed/going}.” Consider where it is best in your language to put the location phrase “from a distance” or “in the distance”. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 22:5 Then Abraham said to his young men, “Stay here by yourselves with the donkey, and I and the boy will go over there and bow down, then we will come back to you.”

Then Abraham said to his young men, 
“Then Abraham/he told his servants,” Be consistent here with how you translated “young men” in verse 3.

“Stay here by yourselves with the donkey,
“You {two} stay here with the donkey,” Some languages have special dual pronouns (that refer to only two people) that can be used in verse 5 to refer to Abraham’s two servants. (See: figs-youdual)

and I and the boy will go
“while the young man and I go” or “while my son and I go”. See how you translated “the boy” in Gen 21:12, 17-20. We do not know for sure how old Isaac was at this time, but estimates range between 18 and 37 years old. Make sure your translation of “boy” allows for that fact.

over there 
“over there {to that mountain}” or “{to the mountain} over there”

and bow down,
“and bow down {to worship God}” or “and worship {God}”. In that culture, people had the custom of bowing down to worship God. Make sure it is clear in your translation why Abraham and Isaac would bow down. (See: translate-symaction)

then we will come back to you.”
“Then we will return to you {here}.” or “After that, we will come back {here} to you.”

Gen 22:6 Then Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and put {it} on Isaac his son, and he took in his hand{s} the fire and the knife. Then the two of them went on together,

Then Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering
“Then Abraham/he took the {fire}wood for the burnt offering {off the donkey},” or “Then Abraham/he took the {fire}wood that they would use to burn the/their sacrifice/offering,” See how you translated “{fire}wood” and “burnt offering” in verse 3.

and put {it} on Isaac his son,
“and loaded/put {it} on his son Isaac{’s shoulder/back} {to carry},” or “and gave {it} to his son Isaac to carry,” The Hebrew text does not specify exactly where Abraham put the wood on Isaac. Only specify that in a translation if it is necessary in your language.

and he took in his hand{s}
“and/while he himself carried” or “He himself carried”. Consider whether or not it is better to begin a new sentence here in your language.

the fire
“a fire pot {with hot coals in it}” or “the {other} things to make/start a fire”. The “fire” can either refer to hot coals (in a pot) or to a flint stone and wood chips that they would use to start the fire on the altar. Make sure that the way you translate this does not mean that Abraham was holding fire or hot coals in his bare hands.

and the knife.
“and a knife {to kill the sacrifice}.” or “and a {sacrifice} knife.”

Then the two of them 
“Then Abraham and Isaac” or “Then they”. Some languages have a dual pronoun that could be used here. (See: figs-dual)

went on together,
“walked on together,” or “continued walking/heading {toward the mountain},”


Gen 22:7 and Isaac spoke to Abraham his father and said, “My father?” And he said, “Behold me, my son.” Then he said, “Behold the fire pot and the wood, but where {is} the lamb for the burnt offering?”

and Isaac 
“and {as they went/walked,} Isaac” or “{As they walked,} Isaac”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

Gen 22:8 And Abraham said, “God will see for himself the lamb for the burnt offering, my son.” Then the two of them went on together.

And Abraham said, 
“Then Abraham said {to him},” or “Abraham answered {him},” (See: writing-quotations)

“God will see for himself 
“God himself will see {to it that there is}” or “God himself will provide”. This is an idiom that means God will provide the lamb. Make sure this meaning is clear in your translation. (See: figs-idiom)

“got to” or “arrived at” or “reached”

the place that God had told to him, 
“the place/mountain that God had told him {to go to}”. See how you translated this phrase in verse 3.

“Abraham built/made a {stone} altar there”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. See how you translated “altar” in Gen 13:4, 18.

and arranged the wood.
“and laid/put the wood {on top of it}.” Abraham arranged the wood on top of the altar so that it would burn well. Make sure your translation of this phrase does not sound like he lit the fire yet; he did not do that until verse 13 when he sacrificed the ram. 

Then he bound Isaac his son
“Then he bound/tied his son Isaac{‘s arms and legs} {with rope}”. (See figs-explicit)

“and put him on top of the wood {that was} on the altar.” Consider which order of these phrases is the clearest and most natural in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 22:10 Then Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to kill his son. 

Then Abraham
“Then he”. Consider whether it is more natural to use a noun or a pronoun here to refer to Abraham. (See: writing-pronouns)

reached out his hand and took the knife
“took the knife in his hand” or “picked up the knife”. See how you translated “knife” in verse 6. 

to kill his son.
“{in order} to kill his son {before sacrificing his body on the altar}.” Sacrifices were not burned alive, but were killed first. Some translation teams prefer to put cultural information like this in a footnote rather than make it explicit in a translation. Do what your team decides is best. (See: figs-explicit)


Gen 22:11 But an angel of Yahweh called to him from heaven and said, “Abraham! Abraham!” And he said, “Behold me.”

But
“But {just then}” or “But {before he/Abraham could use the knife,}” Make sure in your translation that it does not sound like Abraham killed Isaac.

an angel of Yahweh
“an angel from Yahweh” or “one of Yahweh’s angels”. See how you translated “an angel of Yahweh” in Gen 21:17.

called to him from heaven and said, “Abraham! Abraham!” 
“called/shouted to him/Abraham from heaven, “Abraham! Abraham!” ” The angel repeats Abraham’s name to communicate urgency and that he wants him to stop and listen. Make sure your translation does not sound like the angel was angry or criticizing Abraham.

And he said,
“Abraham replied {to the angel},” (See: writing-quotations)

“Behold me.”

Then he said,
“Then the angel said,” or “Then the angel told him,”

“Do not reach out your hand against
“Do not lay your hands on” or “Do not harm/kill”. Consider whether your language has an idiom that has the same meaning as the Hebrew idiom here. (See: figs-idiom)

the boy 
“the young man” or “your son”. See how you translated this in verse 5.

And do not do anything to him,
“Do not do anything to {harm} him” or “You must not do anything to {harm} him” or “You must not harm him in any way”. The angel repeats the previous command using different words in order to emphasize that Abraham should not hurt Isaac. Most languages can do something similar. Do what is natural in your language. (See: figs-parallelism)

“took/untangled the ram {from the thicket/bush}” 

and sacrificed it as a burnt offering
“{Then he killed/slaughtered the ram} and burned it on the altar as a sacrifice/offering {to God}”.

“{including} their firstborn/oldest {son} Uz, then Buz and Kemuel,” or “The first/oldest son/one is Uz, the second is Buz, and the third is Kemuel,”

the father of Aram,
“{who is} the father of Aram” or “who fathered Aram” or “whose son is Aram”


Gen 22:22 and Kesed and Hazo and Pildash and Jidlaph and Bethuel.”

and Kesed and Hazo and Pildash and Jidlaph and Bethuel.”
“{They also have sons named} Kesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.” Make sure it is clear in your translation that the people listed in verse 22 were sons of Nahor and Milcah, not sons of Kemuel (verse 21). Also consider whether it is best in your language to use a conjunction between each name in the list (like Hebrew does), or only before the last name in the list. See what you did for a similar list of names in Gen 10:26-29.


Gen 22:23 And Bethuel fathered Rebekah. Those {are} the eight {sons} Milcah bore for Nahor, the brother of Abraham.

And Bethuel fathered Rebekah.
“Bethuel was the father of Rebekah.” or “who has {a daughter named} Rebekah.” See how you translated “fathered” in Gen 11:27.

Those {are} the eight {sons} Milcah bore for Nahor, the brother of Abraham.
“Those {are} the eight {sons} {that} Milcah had for Abraham’s brother Nahor.” or “Those {are} {the names of} the eight {sons} whom Abraham’s brother Nahor and {his wife} Milcah had together.” or “{Altogether} Milcah bore/had eight sons for Abraham’s brother Nahor.”


 Gen 22:24 And his concubine, and her name {was} Reumah, and she also bore Tebah and Gaham and Tahash and Maacah.

And 
“In addition to that,” or “Besides that,”

his concubine, and her name {was} Reumah, and she also bore
“Nahor’s concubine Reumah also bore/had {some sons, whom they named}” or “Nahor and his servant wife Reumah also had {some sons, including}”

Tebah and Gaham and Tahash and Maacah.
“Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.” See how you connected the list of names in verse 22.

23:1-20 Sarah Dies And Abraham Buys A Cave To Bury Her

Gen 23:1 Now the life of Sarah was 127 years; the years of the life of Sarah. 

Now the life of Sarah was 127 years; 
“Sarah lived 127 years” or “Sarah lived to be 127 years old”

the years of the life of Sarah
“{Yes,} that is how long she lived” or “That is how old she lived to be”. Consider  whether it is better in your language to combine the last part of verse 1 with the beginning of verse 2 and say, “That is how old she was  2 when she died in Kiriath Arba, that is...” (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 23:2 Then Sarah died in Kiriath Arba, that is, Hebron, in the land of Canaan, and Abraham went to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her. 

Then Sarah died
“Then she died” or “before she died”. Decide whether or not it is best to begin a new sentence here in your language.

in Kiriath Arba,
“in {the city of} Kiriath Arba,” or “in {the city of} Kiriath-arba,” The name of this city means “city of Arba” or “city of the four”. You can spell this name as two words, as in the Hebrew text, or combine them into one word, with or without a hyphen. Be consistent with how you spell this name throughout the Bible. (See: translate-names)

that is, Hebron, 
“which is {also called/named} Hebron” or “also known as Hebron”. The city of Kiriath Arba was later named Hebron (Joshua 14:15).

in the land of Canaan,
“in the land/region of/called Canaan”. If it is more natural in your language to put a general location before a specific location, you could move this phrase before the phrase “in {the city of} Kiriath Arba”. (See: figs-infostructure)

and Abraham went
“Abraham went/came {to her}” or “Abraham went/came {to her side}”

to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her.
“to mourn and weep/cry for her.” or “and cried and mourned for her.” For some languages it is necessary to translate this using a verb form that expresses completion or past tense so that it is clear that Abraham actually did this. Do what is natural and clear in your language.


Gen 23:3 Then Abraham got up from beside his dead one and he spoke to the sons of Heth, saying, 

Then Abraham
“After a while, Abraham/he” or “Later he” 

got up from beside 
“got/stood up from {mourning} beside” or “left” 

his dead one
“her body” or “her” or “his wife’s body”

and he spoke to the sons of Heth, saying,
“and he {went to the city gates and} said to {the leaders/elders of} the Hittites {there},” or “and he {went} to {the leaders/elders of} the Hittites {at the city gates} {and} said to them,” In that culture, the leaders of a city would hold their meetings at the city gates, where they would make decisions on important matters such as this one. For some languages it is necessary to make it explicit here in verse 3 that Abraham went to the city gates to meet with the Hittites, rather than wait until verse 10. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-explicit)

the sons of Heth
“the descendants of Heth” or “the Hittites”. Heth was Canaan’s son (Genesis 10:15, 15:20). His descendants were the Hittites. Decide the best way to refer to them here in your language. (See: translate-names)


Gen 23:4 “I {am} a foreigner and a sojourner among you. Give to me property for a burial place among you, so that I can bury my dead from before me.” 

“I {am} 
“I {am coming to you as}” or “{As you know,} I {am}” or “{Since} I {am}”. The leaders of the city already knew that Abraham was a foreigner, so make sure your translation of this sentence does not sound like he is telling them something new that they did not know. (See: figs-explicit)

a foreigner and a sojourner
“a foreigner/outsider who has settled” or “a foreigner/outsider who is living”. See how you translated “foreigner” in Gen 15:13.

among you.
“among you {and I have no land/property of my own}” or “in your land {and/so I do not own any property here}.” It is implied by Abraham and understood by the Hittites that Abraham’s status as a foreigner means he owns no property. Consider whether or not to make this implied information explicit in your translation. (See: figs-explicit)

Give to me
“{Please} give/sell me” or “{Please} let me buy”. Make sure the way you translate this sounds polite, not rude or demanding. (See: writing-politeness)

property for a burial place among you, so that I can bury 
“{some} property/land among you where I can bury/put” or “{some} of your land/property so I have a place to bury/put”

my dead from before me.”
“my dead/deceased {wife} from view.” or “{the body of} my wife who has died.” Translate this in a way that shows respect for the person who has died.


Gen 23:5 Then the sons of Heth replied to Abraham, saying to him, 

Then the sons of Heth
“{The leaders/elders of} the Hittites” or “When {the leaders/elders of} the Hittites {heard that}, they”. See how you translated “the sons of Heth” in verse 3.

replied to Abraham, saying to him,  
“replied/responded to Abraham/him,” or “replied/responded,” (See: writing-quotations)


Gen 23:6 “Listen to us, my lord. You {are} a mighty prince among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our burial places. Each of us will not refuse from you his burial place to bury your dead.”

“Listen to us, my lord.
“{Please} listen to our proposal, my/our lord/master.” or “Sir, {please} listen to what we propose:” Abraham was not their actual lord or master, rather the Hittites are addressing him in a respectful manner. Also, it may be more natural or respectful to put the form of address “My lord” or “Sir” first in this quote. (See: grammar-honorifics)

You {are} a mighty prince among us.
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) “You {are} a powerful/important leader/man {living} among us.” or (2) “You {are} a leader/man of/from God {living} among us.” The interpretation that you do not follow in your translation could be put in a footnote.

Bury your dead in the choicest of our burial places.
“{So} {you may} bury/put your dead/deceased {wife} in {any} one of our best burial sites.” or “{So please choose} {any} one of our best burial sites and bury/put your dead/deceased {wife} there.” 

your dead
“your dead/deceased {wife}” or “{the body of} your wife who has died”

burial places
“places to bury {people who have died}” or “tombs”

Each of us will not refuse from you his burial place to bury
“Each of us is willing/happy to give you {some of} his land where you can bury” or “All of us are willing for you to use {any of} our burial sites to bury” (See: figs-litotes)

your dead.”
“your dead/deceased {wife}.” or “{the body of} your wife who has died.” or “her.” Look at the previous context of verse 6 and consider what is the most natural way to refer to Sarah’s body here in your translation.

_______________Paragraph Break___________________

Gen 23:7 Then Abraham got up and bowed before the people of the land, before the sons of Heth, 

Then Abraham got up
“Abraham got/stood up” or “So Abraham got/stood up”. Consider what is the best way to begin this sentence in your language in this context. Abraham and the leaders/elders of the Hittites were all sitting as they talked to each other.

and bowed
“and bowed {in respect}” or “and bowed down/low {to the ground} {in respect}” or “and kneeled and touched his forehead to the ground {in respect}”. We do not know how far Abraham bowed down. He may have bowed his upper body from a standing position, or he may have knelt down and touched his forehead to the ground with his arms outstretched. (See: translate-symaction)

before 
“before/to” or “in front of”

the people of the land, before the sons of Heth,
“{the leaders/elders of} the Hittites, who owned the land {in the area}” or “the leaders/elders over the Hittites”. The phrase “people of the land” is a term that refers to the leaders of that region who owned land in the area and were the ones to decide whether a foreigner could acquire land.


Gen 23:8 and he said to them, saying, “If it is your will to bury my dead from before me, listen to me and intercede for me with Ephron, the son of Zohar,

and he said to them, saying,
“and said to them,” or “Then he said to them,” Consider whether it is more natural in your language to have two verbs, or just one verb, in this quote margin. (See: writing-quotations) 

“If it is your will
“If you are willing” 

to bury 
“{for me} to bury” or “{to allow me} to bury” 

my dead from before me,
“my dead/deceased {wife} from view,” or “{the body of} my wife who has died,” See how you translated this in verse 4.

listen to me and intercede for me with Ephron, the son of Zohar
“{please} appeal to Ephron the son of Zohar on my behalf” or “{please} help me by asking Zohar’s son Ephron” 


Gen 23:9 so that he will give to me the cave of Machpelah, which {belongs} to him, which {is} at the end of his field. For full price let him give it to me among you as property for a burial place.”

so that he will give to me
“to give/sell to me”

the cave of Machpelah, which {belongs} to him, which {is} at the end of his field.
“his cave that is at the end/edge of his field in the Machpelah {area}.” Machpelah is the name of the area or neighborhood where Ephron’s cave and field were located (verse 17). (See: translate-names)

For full price let him give it to me
“Ask him to give/sell it to me for its full price/value” or “Ask him to sell it to me and I will pay him the full amount that it is worth” 

among you 
“in front of you {all}” or “with all of you {present/here} to witness the sale”

as property for a burial place.”
“so that I will have land/property to bury {the body of my deceased wife}.” or “That way I will have a place {here} where I can bury {the body of my wife who has died}.”  


Gen 23:10 Now Ephron was sitting among the sons of Heth, so Ephron the Hittite responded to Abraham in the ears of the sons of Heth, for everyone {who} had come to the gate of his city, saying, 

Now Ephron was sitting among the sons of Heth, so Ephron the Hittite 
“Now Ephron the Hittite was sitting {there} {at the meeting} among the {other} Hittite leaders/elders, so he” or “Ephron was one of the Hittite leaders/elders who had gathered {there} {at the meeting}, and/so he”

responded to Abraham
“replied to Abraham” (See: writing-quotations) 

in the ears of the sons of Heth,
“in the hearing/presence of {the leaders/elders of} the Hittites,” or “as/while the {other} leaders/elders listened,” (See: figs-idiom)

for everyone {who} had come to the gate of his city,
“including everyone {who} had gathered {there} at the/their city gate,” The pronoun “his” refers back to “everyone” who had gathered at the city gate. 

saying,
“He said,” or “This is what he said:” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. (See: writing-quotations)


 Gen 23:11 “No, my lord. Listen to me: I give to you the field, and I give to you the cave that {is} in it. I give it to you before the eyes of the sons of my people. Bury your dead.”

“No, my lord. 
“That is not necessary, sir.” or “Sir, there is no need for that.” Make sure your translation of this phase sounds polite. In some cultures it is rude to say “No” too directly. (See: writing-politeness)

Listen to me: 
“{Please} listen to this/my proposal:” or “{Please} accept this offer/proposal:” or “{Please} listen to what I am proposing:”

I give to you the field, 
I {hereby} give/offer you the {entire} field,” Ephron is making a formal proposal or offer. Consider how to communicate that in your language.

and I give to you the cave that {is} in it. 
“including the cave that {is} in it.” or “as well as the cave that {is} in it.”

I give it to you 
“I’m giving it/them to you {now/here}” 

before the eyes of the sons of my people.

Gen 23:12 Then Abraham bowed before the people of the land,

“before/to” or “in front of”

the people of the land,
“the people/leaders/elders who owned the land {in the area}” or “the leaders/elders {of/over the Hittites}”. See how you translated this phrase in verse 7. You could translate this slightly differently here since these people have been referred to repeatedly before this.


Gen 23:13 and he spoke to Ephron in the ears of the people of the land, saying, “Rather if you would, please listen to me. I will give the price of the field. Take it from me, then I will bury my dead there.”

“and he said to Ephron while the {rest of} the leaders/elders listened,” or “As/While they {all} listened, he/Abraham said to Ephron,” See how you translated “in the ears of” in verse 10. (See: writing-quotations)

“Rather 
“Rather {than that,}” or “Instead {of doing that,}” 

if you would, 
“If you are willing,” or “Since you are willing {to let me have the field},” In verses 9-15, Abraham and Ephron are bargaining indirectly with each other according to the customs of that culture and time. Keep that in mind as you translate their conversation.

“My lord, 
“Sir,” See how you translated this respectful form of address in verses 6 and 11. (See: grammar-honorifics)

listen to me. 
“{please} listen to me.” See how you translated this in verse 13. Make sure Ephron sounds polite here in your translation. (See: writing-politeness)

Land {worth} 400 shekels of silver,
“The land/field is worth 400 shekels of silver.” or “If I were selling that land, it would cost 400 shekels of silver.” Coins did not exist at that time. Rather people paid each other with shekels of silver or gold, which was a weight measurement. Four hundred shekels of silver was about 10 pounds (4.5 kilos) of silver. Many translation teams like to keep the same numbers that are in the Hebrew text in their translation, and then in a footnote give the equivalent amount in their own currency. Other teams put the equivalent amount in the text and put the literal phrase in a footnote. See how you translated “shekels of silver” in Gen 20:16. (See: translate-bmoney)

between me and you,
“{However/but} since you and I are friends,” or “{But} as far as you and I are concerned,”

what {is} that?
“what {significance} {is} that?” or “that {is} not important.” or “I would not ask you to pay that.” or “there is no need for that.” Decide whether or not a rhetorical question fits here well in your language. (See: figs-rquestion)

So bury your dead.” 
“So {go ahead and} bury your dead/deceased {wife} {there}.” Consider again how you translated “bury...dead” in verses 4, 6, 8, 11, 13 and 15.


Gen 23:16 So Abraham listened to Ephron, and Abraham weighed out to Ephron the price that he had mentioned in the ears of the sons of Heth, 400 shekels of silver, the currency among the merchants.

So Abraham listened to Ephron, 
“Abraham accepted Ephron’s price/offer,” or “Abraham agreed with Ephron’s price/offer,” Make sure it is clear in your translation that Abraham did not just hear what Ephron said, but also acted on it.

the price that he had mentioned
“the {amount of} silver that he/Ephron had stated/suggested”

before everyone who had come to the gate of his city.
“including everyone who had gathered at the city gate.” or “That included everyone who had met together at the city gate.” See how you translated a similar phrase in verse 10. The sentence in verses 17 and 18 is very long. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to break it into two or more shorter sentences and say, “That is how {Abraham bought} Ephron’s field, including the cave and all the trees that were within its borders. The field was in the Machpelah {area}, near {the city of} Mamre. Ephron sold the field 18 to Abraham in front of {the leaders of} the Hittites who had gathered at the city gates, so that they all witnessed/knew that the land was now Abraham’s property.”

Abraham buried Sarah his wife 
“Abraham/he put/placed {the body of} his wife Sarah”

So the field 
“So {that is how} that field,” or “So {in that way,} the field {of Ephron}”. Verse 20 is a concluding summary of chapter 23 and repeats parts of verses 17-18. Make sure the way you translate this does not sound like Abraham bought another property from the Hittites.

“including the cave that {was} in the field,”

were deeded to Abraham 
“was/were {officially/legally} sold to Abraham”. See how you translated this in verse 17.

as property for a burial place from the sons of Heth.
“by the Hittites as a burial place/site.” or “by the Hittites, so that he had a place where he could bury {his wife who had died}.” Consider again how you translated “a burial place” in verses 4, 9, and 20, and how you translated “the sons of Heth” in verses 3, 5, 7, 10, 16, 18, and 20.

24:1-67 Abraham Gets A Wife For Isaac

Gen 24:1 Now Abraham was old, advanced in days, and Yahweh had blessed Abraham in all {things}. 

Now Abraham was old, advanced in days,
“Abraham had lived a long time and was {now} {very} old,” or “Abraham was very old now. He had lived many years,” or “Now Abraham had become very old,” Verse one gives the setting for the new episode and begins with a doublet that emphasizes how old Abraham was. Try to preserve this emphasis in a way that is natural in your translation. (See: figs-doublet)

and Yahweh had blessed Abraham
“and Yahweh had blessed him” or “and Yahweh had caused him to prosper”. See how you translated “bless” in Gen 12:2-3.

in all {things}.
“in everything {he had done}.” or “in every way.”


Gen 24:2 Then Abraham said to his oldest servant of his house who was in charge of everything that {belonged} to him, “Please put your hand under my thigh, 

Then Abraham said to
“{One day} Abraham/he told”. Consider what is the best way to introduce the first event in this episode in your language. (See: writing-newevent)

his oldest servant of his house
“the oldest servant in his household” or “his senior/chief household servant”

who was in charge of 
“who managed” or “who took care of”
 
everything that {belonged} to him,
“everything that he owned,” or “his entire estate for him,” 

“Please put your hand under my thigh,
“Please put your hand under my thigh/leg {to show that you will do what I ask}”. You can make the meaning of this custom explicit in your translation, or you can put that information in a footnote. What Abraham asks his servant to do here is part of the vow-making process in verse 3. (See: translate-symaction)


Gen 24:3 and I will have you swear by Yahweh, the God of the heavens and the God of the earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites whom I am living among, 

and I will have you swear
“I want you to vow {to me}” or “and swear/vow {to me}” or “and make an unbreakable promise {to me}”. Decide the best way to translate this command in your language. Also, see how you translated “swear” in Gen 21:23, and see the note about that there. (See: figs-imperative)

by Yahweh, the God of the heavens and the God of the earth, 
“with Yahweh as your witness, the God who rules/created the heavens and the earth,” See how you translated “the heavens and the earth” in Gen 1:1.

that you will not take a wife for my son from
“that you will not get/find/choose a wife/woman for my son {Isaac} {to marry} from {among}” or “that you will not arrange for my son {Isaac} to marry”. For some languages it is clearer and more natural to make “Isaac” explicit here in verse 3, rather than wait until the end of verse 4. Do what is best in your language. Also, see how you translated the idiom “took a wife for” in Gen 21:21. (See: figs-idiom)

the daughters of the Canaanites whom I am living among,
“the Canaanite women whom we live among” or “{any of} the Canaanite women who live around us here”. Make sure your translation does not sound like Abraham was living by himself among the Canaanites; his family and servants also lived among them with him.


Gen 24:4 but you will go to my country and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son, for Isaac.”

but you will go
“Rather/Instead you must go” or “Rather/Instead I want you to go” (See: figs-imperative)

to my country
“to my {home} country” or “to the country/region where I grew up” or “to the country that I came from”

and to my relatives,
“to my relatives/family/kinfolk {who live there}”

“and find/choose a wife/woman {from there} for my son Isaac {to marry}.” or “and get/choose a wife/woman {from among them} for him {to marry}.” or “and arrange for him to marry one of their daughters.” The way you refer to Isaac here will depend on how you refer to him in verse 3.

Yahweh, the God of the heavens, 
“{because} Yahweh, the God who rules/created the heavens,” Make sure it is clear in your translation that verse 7 gives the reason for verse 6. Also, see how you translated “the God of the heavens” in verse 3.

‘To your offspring I will give this land,’ 
“I will give this land to your offspring/descendants” or “that he would give this land {where we live} to my descendants”. The phrase “this land” refers to the land of Canaan here, not the land where Abraham’s relatives lived. Make sure that is clear in your translation. Also, consider whether it is more natural here in your language to use a direct quote or an indirect quote. (See: figs-quotations)

he will send his angel before you, 
“He will send one of his angels ahead of you {to guide/help you},” If you begin a new sentence here, make sure that the previous sentence is well-formed and complete in your language. Also, see how you translated “angel” in Gen 22:11, 15.

and you will take 
“so that you will {be able to} find/choose” or “so that you can find/get”

a wife for my son from there.
“a wife/woman from my home country/land for my son {to marry}.” See how you translated “take/find a wife for” in verses 3-4.


Gen 24:8 But if the woman is not willing to come with you, then you are clear from this oath of mine. Only do not take my son back there!”

Gen 24:9 Then the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and swore to him concerning this matter. 

Then the servant 
“So the/Abraham’s servant”

put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master
“put his hand under his master/owner Abraham’s thigh/leg”. See how you translated a similar clause in verse 2. Also, in that culture, people owned servants and had complete authority over them. Make sure your translation of “master” and “servant” does not imply that the servant was mistreated. Servants were treated well, could hold important positions and were often considered as members of the master’s family. See how you translated a related term “mistress/owner” in Gen 16:4, 8-9. (See: translate-symaction)

and swore to him
“and vowed to him” or “and made an oath/vow to him” or “and made an unbreakable promise to him”. See how you translated “swore” in verse 7 and “swear” in verse 3.

“that he would do what he/Abraham had requested/told him to do.” or “that he would go get/find a wife/woman for Isaac.” Some languages need to make explicit what “this matter” refers to. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-explicit)


Gen 24:10 Then the servant took ten camels from the camels of his master and left, and all {kinds of} good {things} from his master {were} in his hand, and he got up and went to Aram Naharaim, to the city of Nahor. 

Then the servant 
“Then/Next he” (See: grammar-connect-time-sequential)

took ten camels from the camels of his master
“got ten of his master’s camels ready {for the trip}”. Make sure that your translation of “took” does not imply that the servant stole the camels or valuable things from Abraham. Rather, the “good things” that he loaded on the camels included things that he would give as gifts to Isaac’s relatives (verse 53). Also, see how you translated “camels” in Gen 12:16.

and left, and all {kinds of} good {things} from his master {were} in his hand, and he got up and
“and left {with some other servants}, taking with him many of his master’s valuable things {to give as gifts}. Then he” or “and after he loaded them with all kinds of valuable things from his master {to use as gifts}, he left {with some other servants} and”. For some languages, it is best to make it explicit here in verse 10 that other servants went with Abraham’s chief servant, rather than have them appear suddenly in verse 32. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-explicit)

went to
“made the {long} journey/trip to” or “traveled to”. This was about a 500 mile (800 kilometer) trip and would take camels about seventeen days to complete.

Aram Naharaim,
“{the region of} Aram Naharaim,”

to the city of Nahor.
“to Nahor’s city.” or “to the city where Nahor lived.” Nahor lived in the city of Haran (Gen 11:31-32). That information could be put in a footnote. Make sure your translation of this phrase does not sound like Nahor owned the city.


Gen 24:11 Then he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at evening time, at the time the women who draw water come out. 

Then he made the camels kneel down outside the city
“{When they arrived there,} Abraham’s servant had the camels kneel/lie down {to rest} outside the city”

by the well of water 
“near its well” or “by/near the {community/public} well {that was there}”. Each town or city had a well where people from the city came to get their water. See how you translated “well of water” in Gen 21:19. You might translate this slightly differently here because of the different context.

at evening time,
“It was evening time,” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

at the time the women who draw water come out.
“the time when the {young} women {of the city} came out to draw/get water {from the well} {for their families/homes}.” or “when the {young} women {of the city} were starting to come out {to the well} to draw/get water {for their families/homes}.” In that time and culture, there was no running water in homes so people had to come out to the city well to get water for their families.

Gen 24:13 Behold, I am standing by this spring of water, and the daughters of the people of the city are coming out to draw water. 

Behold, I am standing by
“Look/See, {here} I am, standing beside/near” or “As you see/know, I am standing {here} beside/near”. Make sure in your translation that what Abraham’s servant says here to Yahweh sounds polite and respectful, not rude, demanding or complaining. Also, he is not telling God something that God did not already know. (See: writing-politeness)

this spring of water,
“this spring/well,” or “this spring-fed well,” The phrase “spring of water” (here and in verse 16) refers to the same well that is referred to in verses 11 and 20, which means that this was probably a spring-fed well. Some translation teams use only one term to refer to this spring or well throughout this chapter in order to prevent confusion. Decide what is best in your language.

and the daughters of the people of the city
“and the daughters of the townspeople” or “and the young women of/from the city” 

are coming out to draw water.
“are coming out {here} to draw/get water.” See how you translated “draw/get water” in verse 11.


Gen 24:14 And let it be that the young woman whom I say to her, ‘Please let down your jar so that I may drink,’ and she says, ‘Drink and I will also water your camels,’ let her be the one you have appointed for your servant, for Isaac. And by her I will know that you have shown kindness toward my master.”

And let it be that 
“{Please} make it happen that”. Make sure that your translation of the servant’s request to God sounds polite. (See: writing-politeness)

the young woman whom I say to her, 
“when I say to one of the young women,” The phrase “young woman” is actually a single word in Hebrew (like the old English words “damsel” and “maiden”) and refers to a young woman who is old enough to get married, but has never been married before. Some languages have a single word for this; other languages prefer a phrase.

‘Please let down your jar 
“Please lower your {water} jar/jug/pot”. The water containers that people used were usually made out of clay.

so that I may drink,’
“so that I can drink {some water},” or “so that I can have/take a drink {of water},” 

and she says, 
“and/if she says/replies {to me},” or “she will say {to me},”

‘Drink and I will also water your camels,’
“Have/Take a drink, and I will also draw/get water for your camels”. For some languages it is clearer and more natural to make one or both of the two embedded direct quotes in this verse into indirect quotes. For example you could say, “{Please} make it happen that when I ask one of the young women to lower her jug so that I can have a drink {of water}, she will offer me a drink and will also offer to draw water for my camels.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-quotesinquotes)

“{as a wife} for your servant Isaac.” or “to be the wife of Isaac who serves you,”

And by her I will know that you have shown kindness toward my master.”
“and that you have been kind/gracious to my master {Abraham}.” See how you translated “show kindness toward” in verse 12.

Gen 24:15 Then it happened before he had finished speaking, then behold, Rebekah was coming out, who was born to Bethuel, the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, the brother of Abraham. And her water jar {was} on her shoulder.

Then it happened before he had finished speaking, 
“Before Abraham’s servant had {even} finished speaking/praying {to God},” Many translations omit the phrase “Then it happened”, but this phrase emphasizes the events that follow it and adds suspense, so that the audience wonders what the outcome will be. Do what is natural in your language.

then behold, 
“just then {he saw}” or “suddenly {he saw}”. This phrase spotlights Rebekah and shows that she is the center of attention. Consider the best way to communicate that in your language.

Rebekah was coming out, 
“{a young woman named} Rebekah coming out {of the city}”. Consider what is the best way in your language to introduce Rebekah here for the first time in this episode. Some translations use an exclamation mark to help show the excitement. (See: writing-participants)

who was born to Bethuel, 
“She was the daughter of Bethuel,” or “Her father was Bethuel,”

the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, the brother of Abraham.
“{who was} the son of Milcah and Abraham’s brother Nahor.” or “and his/Bethuel’s parents were Abraham’s brother Nahor and Milcah.” 

And her water jar {was} on her shoulder.
“She was carrying her/a water jug on her shoulder.” or “She had her/a water jar/jug on her shoulder.” It may be more natural to put this clause earlier in this verse and say, “Rebekah was coming out {of the city} with/carrying her/a water jar/jug on her shoulder.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 24:16 And the young woman {was} a very beautiful-looking virgin, and a man had not known her. And she went down to the spring, and filled her jar and came up.

And the young woman {was} a very beautiful-looking virgin, 
“She/Rebekah was a very beautiful unmarried young woman,” See how you translated “young woman” in verses 14 and 15.

and a man had not known her. 
“whom no man had ever slept with.” or “who had never slept with a man.” or “who had never had {marital/sexual} relations with a man.” See how you translated the idiom “not known a man” in Gen 19:8. (See: figs-idiom)

And she went down 
“She went/walked down”. Notice that the spring or well was at a place that was lower than the place where Abraham’s servant was standing.

“to the spring/well,” or “to the spring-fed well,” See how you translated “spring” in verse 13.

and filled her jar
“filled her jar/jug {with water}”

and came up.
“and came/walked {back} up {with/carrying it on her shoulder}.” If it is not clear, you may need to make it explicit in your translation that Rebekah still had the jar with her when she came up from the well or spring, especially since she lowers it from her shoulder in verse 18. (See: figs-explicit)

And she said, 
“She replied,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Drink, my lord.” 
“{Please} have a drink, sir.” or “{Certainly,} sir, {you may} have a drink.” Make sure that Rebekah’s reply is polite and respectful in your language, though the way she addresses Abraham’s servant should not make it sound like she is his slave. Also see how you translated “my lord” in Gen 23:6, 11, 15. (See: grammar-honorifics)

Then she hurried and lowered her jar to her hand{s}
“Then she quickly lowered her jar/jug {from her shoulder} to her hands” (See: figs-explicit)

into the trough,
“into the {animal} {drinking} trough/place {that was there},” or “into the {stone} trough/container/thing {that was there for animals to drink out of},” The drinking trough was a long, open stone container that several animals could drink from at the same time. (See: translate-unknown)

and she drew water for all his camels.
“until she had drawn/brought {enough} for all of the camels.” 


Gen 24:21 And the man watched her silently to know whether Yahweh had made his journey succeed or not.

And the man watched her silently 
“Meanwhile the/Abraham’s servant silently watched her/Rebekah {and waited}” or “While she/Rebekah was doing that, the/Abraham’s servant silently watched her”. Starting in verse 21 the Hebrew text takes Rebekah and Laban’s perspective and refers to Abraham’s servant as “the man”. This continues until verse 34, when the servant tells everyone that he is Abraham’s servant. For some languages this is confusing (because it sounds like two different people), so for those languages it is necessary to refer to him as “Abraham’s servant” or “the servant” throughout this chapter. (See: writing-participants)

to know whether Yahweh had made his journey succeed or not.
“to find out whether or not Yahweh had made him successful on his journey/trip {to find a wife for Isaac}.” or “to know/see for sure whether/if Yahweh had given him success on his journey/trip.” (See: figs-infostructure)

“the/Abraham’s servant”

took out a gold nose ring, its weight {was} a beka,
“brought out a gold nose ring weighing one beka {and gave it to Rebekah/her}” or “gave {Rebekah/her} a gold nose ring that weighed one beka”. Many translation teams keep the numbers and the names of weights that are used in the Bible text in their translation, and they may or may not put the modern equivalents in pounds or grams in a footnote. Other teams do the opposite. One beka was about 1/5 of an ounce (5.5 grams), and ten shekels (see below) was about 4 ounces (110 grams). (See: translate-bweight)

and two gold bracelets 
“He also gave her two gold bracelets”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. 

for her arms,
“for her wrists”. The Hebrew term is ambiguous here; it can refer to hands, arms or wrists. However in this context, the bracelets would have been put on the arms or the wrists.

their weight {was} ten shekels.
“that weighed ten shekels {each}.” or “Each bracelet weighed ten shekels.” (See: translate-bweight)


Gen 24:23 And he said, “Whose daughter {are} you? Please tell me. Is there a place at the house of your father for us to lodge?”

And he said,
“Then he said {to her/Rebekah},” or “Then he asked {her/Rebekah},” (See: writing-quotations)

“Whose daughter {are} you? Please tell me. 
“Please tell me who your father {is}.” The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. The phrase “Please tell me” can go: (1) with the previous question; or (2) with the following question. Since Abraham’s servant’s goal is to find a wife for Isaac who is one of Abraham’s relatives, the first interpretation seems most likely.

Is there a place at the house of your father
“{Also,} is there {enough} room/space at/in his house” or “{Also,} does your father have enough/any room in/at his house”. If you made “your father” explicit in the previous sentence, it may be more natural to refer to him with the pronoun “his” in this sentence. (See: writing-pronouns)

for us
“for me and my men”. The pronoun “us” includes other servants who came with Abraham’s chief servant (as verse 32 shows). If your language has inclusive and exclusive forms of this pronoun, you should use the exclusive form here. (See: figs-exclusive)

“to spend the night {there}?” or “to stay {there} tonight?”


Gen 24:24 Then she said to him, “I {am} the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah, whom she bore for Nahor.”

the son of Milcah, whom she bore for Nahor.” 
“{who is} a son of Milcah and Nahor.” or “{and he is} one of Nahor and Milcah’s sons.” or “and his parents are Nahor and Milcah.” Make sure the way you translate this does not sound like Bethuel was the only son of Milcah and Nahor; they had eight sons (Gen 22: 21-22). Also, in some cultures the father’s name is normally given first; in other cultures the mother’s name is normally first.


Gen 24:25 Then she said to him, “Plenty of both straw and fodder {are} with us. {There is} also a place to lodge.” 

Then she said to him,
“Then she added/continued,” Some languages leave this quote margin implied here, because the same person is still talking to the same person. Other languages can keep the quote margin (like the Hebrew text does), to emphasize what Rebekah says next. The quote margin may also indicate that Rebekah paused before she said what she says in verse 25. (See: writing-quotations)

“Plenty of both straw and fodder {are} with us.
“We have plenty of both straw and {other} feed {at our house} {for the/your camels to eat},” The term “fodder” refers to dry feed that is prepared for animals to eat; it can include chopped hay and grains such as oats and barley.
   
{There is} also a place 
“{and there is} also {enough} room {at/in his/our house} {for all of you}”

“to spend the night {there}.” or “to stay {there} tonight.” See how you translated this in verse 23.


Gen 24:26 Then the man bowed down and prostrated himself before Yahweh,

Then the man bowed down and prostrated himself before Yahweh,
“Then the/Abraham’s servant bowed to the ground and worshiped Yahweh”. See how you translated “bowed” in Gen 18:2; 19:1. The word “prostrated” means he bowed low to the ground and touched his face or forehead to the ground with outstretched arms, in an act of worship. When combined with “bowed down” as in this verse, it is usually translated as “worshiped”. (See: translate-symaction)


Gen 24:27 and said, “Praised be Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who has not abandoned his kindness and his faithfulness toward my master. {As for} me, Yahweh has led me on the road {to} the home of the relatives of my master!”

“saying,” or “He said,” The servant is worshiping God by bowing down and by what he says in verse 27.

“Praised be Yahweh,
“Praise Yahweh,” or “I praise Yahweh,” See how you translated this in Gen 9:26.

the God of my master Abraham,
“the God {who takes care} of my master Abraham” or “{who is} the God whom my master Abraham worships/serves”. See how you translated “God of my master Abraham” in verse 12.

who has not abandoned his kindness and his faithfulness toward my master. 
“He has never stopped being kind and faithful to my master” or “He has always been kind and faithful to my master”. See how you translated “kindness” in verses 12 and 14. The phrase “not abandoned” is a way of emphasizing that Yahweh had always been kind and faithful to Abraham. (See: figs-litotes)

{As for} me, Yahweh has led me on the road
“and he has guided me on the road/journey {here}” or “{Yes,} Yahweh/he guided me on the/my journey/trip {here}”. The last part of verse 27 is what Abraham’s servant is praising God for; it is an example of how God has been kind and faithful to Abraham.

“{to} the home of my master’s relatives/family!” or “{to} the home where my master’s relatives/family live!”

Consider the best way to express this in your language. For some languages it may be necessary to combine verses 29-30 and put the sentences in the order that things actually happened. For example, “Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban. When he saw the nose ring and the bracelets that she was wearing, and heard her tell what the man had said to her, he hurried out to meet the man. He found/saw him standing with his camels beside the well.” If you do this, you would mark these combined verses as 29-30. (See: translate-versebridge)

had seen the nose ring, and the bracelets on the arms of his sister
“had seen the nose ring that his sister was wearing and the bracelets on her arms” or “had seen the nose ring and the bracelets that his sister was wearing”. Some languages have a specific term for “younger sister” that fits well here. Also see how you translated “nose ring” and “bracelets” in verse 22.

and when he had heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, “This {is} what the man said to me,” 
“and had heard her announce/tell/report what the man {at the well} had said to her,” Consider whether it is more natural in your language to use a direct quote or indirect quote here. If you want to make it clear who “the man” refers to, you should still translate it generally, for example, “the man {I met at the well}” because when Rebekah 
said this, she did not yet know who he was. (See: figs-quotations) 

then he went to the man, 
“he went {out} to {where} the man/servant {was}” or “he went {out} to meet him” (See: writing-pronouns)

and behold, he was standing 
“and there he was, standing” or “He found/saw him standing”. The word “behold” emphasizes what follows it. Consider the best way to do this in your language.

by the camels at the spring. 
“with {his} camels at/beside the spring/well.” or “beside/near the spring/well with {his} camels.”


Gen 24:31 Then he said, “Come, blessed of Yahweh. Why are you standing out here? For I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.”

Then he said, 
“Then Laban said {to him},” or “Then Laban said {to the man/servant},” Make sure it is clear in your translation that Laban is the one talking here. Consider whether or not to include whom he is speaking to in this quote margin. (See: writing-quotations)

“Come, 
“Come {with me},” or “{Please} come {stay with us},”

blessed of Yahweh.
“{you who are} blessed by Yahweh.” or “you whom Yahweh has blessed.” 

Why are you standing out here? 
“There is no need for you to stand out here.” Laban is being polite here, not accusing or critical. For some languages a rhetorical question does not fit here. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-rquestion)

For I have prepared the house 
“I have gotten our house ready {for you and your men to stay with us}” or “because the house is prepared/ready {for you and your men to lodge/stay there}”. Consider whether or not it is necessary in your translation to make any implied information explicit in this sentence. (See: figs-explicit)

and a place 
“and {there is also} a place” or “and {we also have} room/space {there}”

for the camels.”
“for {your} camels {to stay}.” or “where your camels can stay.”

Gen 24:32 So the man went to the house. Then he unloaded the camels and gave straw and fodder to the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who {were} with him.

So the man
“Then the man/servant” or “So Abraham’s servant” 

went to the house. 
“went/came to Laban’s house.” or “went/came home {with Laban}.” The Hebrew verb can be translated “went” or “came”, depending on the perspective that is taken. Do what is most natural in your language. (See: figs-go)

Then he unloaded the camels
“{When they arrived there,} Laban unloaded the camels” or “There Laban took the loads off the camels”. The Hebrew text (“he”) is ambiguous here, but since Laban was the host it is most likely that he (or some of his servants) took care of the camels for his guests.

and gave straw and fodder to the camels,
“and he gave straw and {other} feed to them {to eat}” or “and fed them straw and {other] fodder/feed”. See how you translated “straw and fodder” in verse 25.

and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who {were} with him.
“{He} also {gave/brought} water to the/Abraham’s servant and the men who {were} with him, to wash {the dust/dirt off} their feet.” or “{He} also {brought} water for the/Abraham’s servant and his men to wash {the road dust/dirt off} their feet.” Make sure your translation does not sound like Abraham’s chief servant washed the feet of the other servants who were with him; each person washed off his own feet. See how you translated “wash {the dust off} your feet” in Gen 19:2. (See: figs-explicit)


Gen 24:33 Then food was set before him to eat, but he said, “I will not eat until I have spoken my words.” So he said, “Speak.”

Then food was set before him to eat, 
“Then they served/brought the servant {and his men} some food,” or “After that, {Laban’s family} served/provided them a meal to eat,” Consider whether it is best in your language to use a passive or active construction here. (See: figs-activepassive)

but he said,
“but the man/servant said {to them},” or “but the man/servant said {to Laban’s family},” (See: writing-quotations)

“I will not eat until I have spoken my words.”
“I will/must not eat {anything} until I have told you my message.” or “Before I will/can eat {anything}, I need to tell {you} why I am here.”

So he said,
“So/Then Laban replied,” or “Laban responded {to him},” (See: writing-quotations)

“Speak.”
“{Please} tell {us} {what you have/want to say}.” or “{Go ahead and} tell {us} {your message}.” Make sure the way you translate this sounds polite. (See: writing-politeness)

“I {am} a servant of Abraham.
“I {am} Abraham’s {chief/head} servant.” 


Gen 24:35 And Yahweh has greatly blessed my master so that he has become great. And he has given him flock{s} and herd{s}, and silver and gold, and men slaves and women slaves, and camels and donkeys.

“Yahweh has abundantly blessed/prospered my master”

so that he has become great.
“so that he is wealthy.” or “and as a result, he is {very} wealthy.” (See: grammar-connect-logic-result)

And he has given him flock{s} and herd{s},
“Yahweh has given him {many} sheep and cattle,” This is the beginning of a list of what Yahweh had given Abraham. Consider the most natural way to list items in your language. Also, see how you translated “flocks and herds” in Gen 13:5.

and silver and gold,
“{much} silver and gold,” See how you translated “silver and gold” in Gen 13:2.

and men slaves and women slaves,
“{many} men and women slaves/servants” or “{many} male and female slaves/servants,” See how you translated this phrase in Gen 20:14.

has given to him
“has given him” or “has given his/that son”

“made/had me vow {to do something for him}” or “asked me to make an unbreakable promise to him”. See how you translated “swear” in verse 3, and “swore’ in verses 7 and 9.

by saying,
“and he said {to me},” or “He said,” or “This is what he said {to me}:” (See: writing-quotations)

‘You must not take a wife for my son from

the daughters of the Canaanites
“the Canaanite women”

“whose land we have been living in” or “whom we live among in this land”. As in verse 3, make sure your translation does not sound like Abraham lived by himself among the Canaanites; his family and servants also lived among them with him.


Gen 24:38 but rather you must go to the house of my father, and to my clan, and take a wife for my son.’

but rather
“Rather/Instead”. Consider whether or not it is more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here. After you translate a section, it is a good habit to read through it at normal speed as you pay attention to where it is best to begin new sentences so that sentences and paragraphs flow well and it is easy for people to read.

And he said to me, 
“He answered/told me,” or “He replied to me,”

‘Yahweh, whom I walk before,
“Yahweh, whose presence I walk/live in,” or “Yahweh whom I serve/obey,” See how you translated “walk/live before” in Gen 17:1. This idiom implies that Abraham lived according to God’s will. (See: figs-idiom)

“will send one of his angels”. See how you translated this in verse 7.

“your journey successful,” or “you succeed on your journey,”

so that you will take a wife for my son from my clan,
“so that you will/can get/find/choose a wife for my son from {among} my relatives,” or “so that you can arrange for my son to marry a woman who is one of my relatives,” See how you translated “clan” in verse 38, and consider again how you translated “take a wife for my son” in verses 3, 4, 7, 37-38.

Then 
“At that/this time” or “But if this happens,” or “There is a situation/circumstance when”. The word “Then” is a special Hebrew word that can mean “at that time” and implies here that the servant’s question (in verse 39) is now being addressed specifically.

 you will be clear from my oath:

Gen 24:58 So they called for Rebekah and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” And she said, “I will go.” 

So they called for Rebekah 
“So they called for her” or “So/Then they summoned her”. Consider whether it is better to use a name or a pronoun to refer to Rebekah here in your language, especially considering how you referred to her in verses 53, 55, and 57. (See: writing-pronouns)

and said to her,
“and asked her,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Will you go with this man?”
“Are you willing to go {now] with this man?” or “Do you want to go {now} with this man?”

And she said, 
“She answered {them},” (See: writing-quotations)

“I will go.”
“{Yes,} I will go {now}.” or “{Yes,} I am willing to go {now}.”


Gen 24:59 Then they sent off Rebekah their sister and her nurse and the servant of Abraham and his men.

Then they sent off Rebekah their sister 
“So they {agreed/decided to} send their sister Rebekah”. Notice that Rebekah does not actually leave until verse 61. If this is not clear in your translation, you could include the implied information that they agreed or decided to send her with Abraham’s servant. (See: figs-explicit)

and her nurse 
“and her {personal} servant {who had helped raise her},” The term “nurse” refers here to a servant woman who probably nursed Rebekah as a baby, took care of her as she was growing up, and still served her now.

and the servant of Abraham and his men.
“with the servant of Abraham and his men/companions.”
 

Gen 24:60 And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, “Our sister, may you become thousands of myriads, and may your offspring possess the gates of {those} hating them!”

And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, 
“They blessed Rebekah by saying to her,” Make sure your translation of “blessed...and said” refers to the same event, not two separate events.

“Our sister, 
“{Dear} {little} sister,” This is a term of endearment that family members used to refer to Rebekah even though she was not the actual sister of all of them. This practice is common in many cultures. Do what is natural in your language.

“conquer the cities of {all} their enemies!” or “conquer/defeat {all} their enemies and rule over them!” See how you translated the phrase “possess the gates” in Gen 22:17. (See: figs-metonymy)


Gen 24:61 Then Rebekah got up and her maids, and they mounted the camels and went with the man. So the servant took Rebekah and left.

Then Rebekah got up and her maids, and they
“Then Rebekah and her maids/servants {who were going with her} got ready {to go} and/then” or “After Rebekah and her maids/servants {who were going with her} packed their things, they” 

mounted the camels 
“got up on the camels {they were going to ride}”

and went with the man.
“and went with Abraham’s servant.” Consider again how you translated “the man” in verses 21, 22, 26, 29, 30, 32, 61. See the note about this at verse 21. 

So the servant took Rebekah 
“So the/Abraham’s servant took Rebekah {with him}” or “So he took her {with him}”

and left.
“and left {to return home}.” or “and started the journey {back} home.”

Gen 24:62 Meanwhile Isaac came from going to Beer Lahai Roi, and he was living in the land of the Negev.

Meanwhile Isaac came from going to
“Meanwhile Isaac returned {home} from visiting” or “{While they were traveling,} Isaac returned {home} from a trip/visit {he had made} to”

Beer Lahai Roi,
“{the place/well called} Beer Lahai Roi”. See how you translated the name of this place in Gen 16:14. (See: translate-names)

and he was living 
“{At that time} he was living” or “and/so he was {back home} where he lived”

in the land of the Negev.
“in the Negev {Wilderness/Desert} region/area.” or “in the Negev {Wilderness/Desert}.” See how you translated “the land of the Negev” in Gen 20:1, and “the Negev” in Gen 12:9; 13:1, 3.


Gen 24:63 And Isaac went to meditate in the field as it was turning toward evening, and he lifted his eyes and saw that behold, camels were coming.

And Isaac 
“{One day} Isaac/he” or “{After Isaac/he had returned home, one day} he” or “{Sometime after Isaac had returned home,} he”. What Isaac does in verse 63 happened sometime after he returned from Beer Lahai Roi, but the Hebrew text does not say exactly when. So introduce this new event in a general way that is not too specific.

went to meditate in the field
“went out in/to the fields/countryside to meditate/pray” or “was meditating/praying out in the fields/countryside”

as it was turning toward evening
“as it was becoming evening/dusk” or “late in the afternoon”. For some languages it is more natural to put this time phrase earlier in this sentence and say, for example, “{One day} as it was becoming evening, Isaac/he went” or “One evening, Isaac/he went”. Do what is natural in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

and he lifted his eyes
“{As he was praying,} he looked up” (See: figs-idiom)

and saw that behold, 
“and saw {in the distance} that there were” or “and suddenly he saw {in the distance}”
 
camels were coming.
“{some} camels coming/heading {toward him}.” or “{some} camels approaching {him}.”


Gen 24:64 And Rebekah lifted her eyes and saw Isaac. Then she dismounted from the camel,

And Rebekah lifted her eyes and saw Isaac. 
“Rebekah {also} looked up and saw Isaac.”

Then she dismounted 
“Then she {quickly} jumped/got down” or “Immediately she got down”

from the camel,
“from/off the camel {that she was riding},” Consider again how you translated “camel” throughout chapter 24.


Gen 24:65 and she said to the servant, “Who {is} that man in the field who is coming to meet us?” And the servant said, “He {is} my master.” So she took the veil and covered herself.

and she said to the servant, 
“and asked {Abraham’s} servant,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Who {is} that man in the field who is coming to meet us?” 
“Who {is} that man in the field who is walking {this way} to greet us?” or “Who {is} that man walking towards us in the field?”

And the servant said, “He {is} my master.” 
“The servant answered {her}, “He {is} my master {Isaac}.” ” Abraham and Isaac were both the servant’s masters, especially since Abraham had already given Isaac all of his possessions (verse 36), which included his servants. Consider again how you translated “master/owner” throughout chapter 24.

So she took the veil and covered herself.
“So she took the/her veil and covered her face with it {to show modesty}.” or “So she covered herself with a/her veil {to show modesty}.” In that culture a bride-to-be wore a large veil to cover her entire body, especially her face, to show modesty and submission to her husband. (See: translate-symaction)

Gen 24:67 Then Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother, and he took Rebekah, and she became a wife to him. And Isaac loved her and he was comforted after his mother.

Then Isaac brought her 
“Then/So Isaac brought/took Rebekah” 

into the tent of Sarah his mother,
“into the tent where his mother Sarah had lived {before she died},” Make sure your translation of this phrase does not sound like Sarah still lived there; she had died three years previously (Gen 23:1-2).

and he took Rebekah, 
“and he married her,” (See: figs-idiom)

and she became a wife to him.
“so that she became his wife.” 

And Isaac loved her
“Isaac loved her/Rebekah” or “Isaac was/fell in love with her/Rebekah”

25:1-6 Abraham And Keturah’s Descendants 
 1 Chronicles 1:32-33

Gen 25:1 Then Abraham added and took a wife, and her name {was} Keturah. 

Then Abraham added and took a wife, and her name {was} Keturah. 
“Then Abraham married another wife/woman, who was named Keturah.” or “Then Abraham got married again, and his wife’s name {was} Keturah.” Abraham probably married Keturah after Sarah died (Gen 23:1-2) and after Isaac married Rebekah (Gen 24:67). Make sure your translation of this verse does not sound like Abraham had two wives named Keturah. (See: figs-idiom)


Gen 25:2 And she bore for him Zimran and Jokshan and Medan and Midian and Ishbak and Shuah. 

And she bore for him
“She/Keturah gave birth to sons for him/Abraham {whose names were}” or “She bore/had {sons} for/with him {whom they named}” or “They had sons together {whom they named}”. See how you translated “bore for him” in Gen 21:3; 24:47.

Zimran and Jokshan and Medan and Midian and Ishbak and Shuah. 
“Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.” See how you used commas and conjunctions in similar lists of names in Gen 22:22, 24. (See: translate-names) 


Gen 25:3 And Jokshan fathered Sheba and Dedan. And the descendants of Dedan were the Asshurim and the Letushim and the Leummim.

And Jokshan fathered 
“Jokshan was the father of” or “{Her/Keturah’s son} Jokshan had”. See how you translated “fathered” in Gen 11:27.

Sheba and Dedan.
“{sons named} Sheba and Dedan.” or “{sons whom they named} Sheba and Dedan.” (See: translate-names)

And the descendants of Dedan were the Asshurim and the Letushim and the Leummim.
“Dedan’s descendants were/became {people/ethnic groups named} the Asshurites, Letushites, and Leummites.” See how you translated the names of people groups in Gen 10:4, 13-14, 16-18, and see the note about that at 10:4. (See: figs-explicit)


Gen 25:4 And the sons of Midian {were} Ephah and Epher and Hanoch and Abida and Eldaah. All of those {were} the descendants of Keturah.

And the sons of Midian {were} 
“{Keturah’s son} Midian fathered/had sons {named}”

Ephah and Epher and Hanoch and Abida and Eldaah. 
“Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah.” (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)

All of those {were} the descendants of Keturah.
“All of those {were} Keturah’s descendants {whom she had with Abraham}.” or “All those {were} the descendants of Keturah {and Abraham}.” This phrase refers back to all the people listed in verses 2-4, which includes Keturah’s six sons, seven grandsons and three great grandsons. Make sure you spelled “Keturah” consistently in verses 1-4.

Gen 25:5 And Abraham gave everything that {belonged} to him to Isaac.

And Abraham gave everything that {belonged} to him to Isaac.
“Abraham left/willed everything that he owned to Isaac.” or “And Isaac inherited all/everything that Abraham owned/possessed.” Some languages have a specific word such as “left” or “willed” that means to give something as an inheritance. In that time and culture, a father would give his children their inheritance before he died.


Gen 25:6 And to the sons of the concubines who {belonged} to Abraham, Abraham gave gifts, and while he was still alive he sent them eastward to the land of Kedem, away from Isaac his son.

And to the sons of the concubines who {belonged} to Abraham, Abraham gave gifts, 
“Abraham/He also gave {valuable} gifts to the sons he had with his concubines,” or “Abraham/He also gave (valuable gifts) to the sons that his servant wives had {for/with him},” See how you translated “concubine” in Gen 22:24. The word “gifts” in this clause is very general and can include domestic animals, servants, gold, silver, and other things. (See: figs-infostructure)

and while he was still alive 
“then while he was still alive” or “then” or “and/but after that”

he sent them eastward to the land of Kedem,
““he sent them eastward to the land/region in the East” or “he sent them to the east country” or “he made them move away to the east country”. The Hebrew word “Kedem” means “east” and refers to the region east of Canaan and the Dead Sea. Consider whether it is best in your language to transliterate (copy) the Hebrew name or to translate the meaning. (See: translate-names)

away from Isaac his son.
“{to be/live} {far} away from his son Isaac.” or “{so that they would live/be} {far} away from his son Isaac.” (See: figs-explicit)


25:7-11 Abraham’s Death And Burial

 Gen 25:7 And these are the days of the years of the life of Abraham that he lived: 175 years.

And these are the days of the years of the life of Abraham that he lived: 175 years.
“The length of Abraham’s life that he lived was 175 years.” or “Abraham lived a total of 175 years.” or “Abraham lived to be 175 years old.”


Gen 25:8 Then Abraham exhaled and died at a good old age, elderly and full, and he was gathered to his people.

Then Abraham exhaled 
“Then Abraham/he breathed out {for the last time}” or “Then he breathed/took his last/final breath”

and died at a good old age, 
“and died at a ripe/very old age,” or “and died when he was very old,”

elderly and full, and
“an elderly/old man who had lived a full life, and” or “After he had lived a long and satisfying/blessed life,” The idiom “full” refers to a long life that was blessed by God. Also consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. (See: figs-idiom)

he was gathered to 
“he was gathered/taken {by God} to be with” or “{God} took his spirit to be with” or “he joined”. The phrase “gathered to his people” is a euphemism that refers to dying but also implies that God took his spirit to be with his ancestors who had already died. It is best to translate this phrase fairly literally since it teaches about life after death.

his people.
“his ancestors/relatives {who had already died}.” or “his ancestors/relatives {who had gone/died before him}.” or “his {deceased} ancestors/relatives.” Make sure your translation of this phrase does not sound like these ancestors were still alive. They had already died before Abraham died. (See: figs-explicit)


Gen 25:9 Then Isaac and Ishmael his sons buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which {was} before Mamre,

Then Isaac and Ishmael his sons 
“His sons Isaac and Ishmael”
 
buried him 
“buried/put/placed his body”

in the cave of Machpelah,
“in the cave of/in the Machpelah {area}”. See how you translated this phrase in Gen 23:9, and see the note about that there. Also see how you translated similar phrases in Gen 23:17, 19.

in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, 
“{which was} in the field that had belonged to Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite,” Ephron no longer owned the field (see verse 10).

which {was} before Mamre,
“east of {the city of} Mamre.” or “near {the city of} Mamre.” For some languages it is clearer or more natural to put this phrase earlier in this verse. Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated “before Mamre” in Gen 23:17, 19. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 25:10 the field that Abraham had bought from the sons of Heth. There Abraham was buried, and Sarah his wife. 

the field that Abraham had bought
“{That is} the {same} field that Abraham had bought” 

from the sons of Heth. 
“from the Hittites.” The Hebrew text has two different ways to refer to the Hittites; compare the phrase here with verse 9 where a single Hebrew word is used to refer to this people group. See how you translated “the sons of Heth” in Gen 23:20.

There Abraham was buried, and Sarah his wife. 
“Abraham was buried in that cave, where his wife Sarah had also been buried.” or “That is {the cave} where his/Abraham’s sons buried/put/placed his body next to {the body of} his wife Sarah {whom he had buried there before}.” or “That is where Sarah had been buried, and they buried Abraham {next to her}.” Abraham had already buried Sarah’s body in the cave (Gen 23:19). Make sure your translation of this sentence does not sound like Sarah was buried there a second time. (See: figs-explicit)

Gen 25:16 Those {were} the sons of Ishmael, and those {are} their names by their settlements and by their camps, twelve rulers according to their tribes. 

Those {were} the sons of Ishmael, 
“Those/They {were} Ishmael’s {twelve} sons”

and those {are} their names by their settlements and by their camps, twelve rulers according to their tribes. 
“who became the rulers/leaders of twelve tribes that were named after them, and each tribe lived in its {own} settlements/towns and camps/villages.” or “Each of them became the ruler/leader of a tribe that was named after him, and each tribe had its own towns/villages and {tent} camps/settlements.” The Hebrew words for “settlements” and “encampments” overlap in meaning. Both refer to temporary or permanent places where people settled, surrounded by some sort of wall or fence. (See: figs-infostructure)

rulers
“{original} leaders/chiefs”. Many translations have “princes” here, but these Ishmaelite rulers were not actually sons of a king. See how you translated “rulers” in Gen 17:20.

And they settled 
“His/Ishmael’s descendants settled/lived”

“{throughout the area that extended} from {the region of} Havilah to {the wilderness/desert of} Shur”. Be consistent here with how you spelled “Havilah” in Gen 2:11; 10:7, 29 and “Shur” in Gen 16:7; 20:1. The name “Shur” means “wall”. The Wilderness of Shur may have been named after a city or fortification named Shur that was located near the eastern border of Egypt (Gen 16:7). (See: translate-names)

that {is} near Egypt 
“that {is} east of {the country/land of} Egypt” 

as you go 
“as you go/head {from there}” or “as one goes/travels” 

toward
“to” or “in the direction of” or “all the way to”

Asshur.
“{the city of} Asshur {in Assyria}.” or “{the land/country of} Assyria.” Assyria and its capital city Asshur were far east of Shur. Consider again how you spelled “Asshur” in Gen 2:14; 10:11, 22; and 25:3, 18. 

He fell in the face of all his brothers.
The Hebrew text has an idiom here that is ambiguous in this context. It could mean (1) “He/They lived in hostility toward/against all his/their brothers/relatives.” or “They lived as enemies against all their brothers/relatives.” See how you translated a different idiom in 16:12 that probably has this meaning. (2) “They settled/lived in the presence of all their brothers/relatives.” or “They settled/lived among/near all their brothers/relatives.” (3) “He/Ishmael died in the presence of all his brothers/relatives.” or “He/Ishmael died when all his brothers were still alive.” (See: figs-idiom)


25:19-26 The Birth Of Isaac’s Sons Jacob And Esau

Gen 25:19 And these {are} the generations of Isaac the son of Abraham: Abraham fathered Isaac, 

And these {are} the generations of Isaac the son of Abraham:
“This/Here {is} {more of} the record/history of/about Abraham’s son Isaac and his descendants/family:” or “What follows tells {more} about Abraham’s son Isaac and his descendants/family:” We have already heard about much of Isaac’s history in previous chapters; now we are told even more. See how you translated “these are the generations of” in verse 12 and Gen 6:9.

Abraham fathered Isaac, 
“{After} Abraham fathered/had {his son} Isaac,” See how you translated “fathered” in verse 3.


Gen 25:20 then Isaac was a son of 40 years when he took Rebekah for himself as a wife, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan Aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean.

then Isaac was a son of 40 years when he took Rebekah for himself as a wife, 
“Isaac {grew up and} married Rebekah when he was 40 years old”. See how you translated “was a son of...years” in Genesis 21:5.

Gen 25:21 And Isaac entreated Yahweh on behalf of his wife because she {was} barren. So Yahweh was entreated by him, and Rebekah his wife conceived.

And Isaac entreated Yahweh on behalf of his wife because she {was} barren. 
“Isaac prayed {earnestly} to Yahweh for his wife {to have children} because she {was} barren/infertile.” or “But/However {for many years} Rebekah was not able to become/get pregnant, so Isaac prayed that Yahweh would give her children.” Isaac and Rebekah had been married for almost 20 years and they still had no children. See how you translated “barren” in Gen 11:30. Also, it may be clearer to change the order of the clauses in this sentence to put them in the order in which they happened. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

So Yahweh was entreated by him, 
“Yahweh answered his/Isaac’s prayer,” or “Yahweh did what he/Isaac prayed for,”

and Rebekah his wife conceived.
“so that Rebekah/she became pregnant {with twins}.” For some languages it is clearer to include here the fact that Rebekah was pregnant with two babies, rather than wait until verse 22. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-explicit)


Gen 25:22 And the children struggled against each other inside her, so she said, “Why {is this} so? Why {am} I {like} this?” And she went to inquire of Yahweh.

And the children 
“And/But the {two} babies” or “After a while the twins”

struggled against each other inside her, 
“wrestled with each other inside her,” or “inside her kept/started pushing/shoving against each other,”

so she said, 
“so she/Rebekah asked,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Why {is this} so? Why {am} I {like} this?” 
“Why is this happening to me?” or “What is happening inside me?”

And she went to inquire of Yahweh.
“Then she went/turned to Yahweh to ask him {what was happening}.” or “Then she prayed to Yahweh about it.”


Gen 25:23 And Yahweh said to her, “Two nations {are} inside your womb, and two peoples will be divided from inside your womb. And one people will be stronger than the other people, and the older will serve the younger.”

And Yahweh said to her, 
“Yahweh answered her,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Two nations {are} inside your womb, 
“{The ancestors of} two {future} people groups {are} inside you” or “Inside you {are} {the ancestors of} two people groups” or “{The two babies} inside your womb will become {the fathers/ancestors of} two nations”. Many translations put Yahweh’s words in poetry format in this verse. If your translation team decides to do this, see a Bible version that does this to know where to divide the clauses.

Gen 25:24 Then her days were fulfilled to deliver, and behold, twins {were} inside her womb.

Then her days were fulfilled to deliver, 
“Later when it was time for her/Rebekah to give birth,”

and behold, twins {were} inside her womb.
“sure enough, there were twin boys inside her!”


Gen 25:25 And the first came out red, all of him {was} like a garment of hair, so they called his name Esau.

And the first came out red, all of him {was} like a garment of hair, 
“When the first one/baby came out, he was covered with thick red hair so that he was as hairy as a fur coat/robe.” or “The first {one/baby} who was born was completely covered with thick red hair.” (See: figs-simile)

so they called his name 
“So his parents named him” or “So he was called/named”. The Hebrew text has “they” here, which probably refers to Esau’s parents and may include people in general after his parents named him. 

Esau.
“Esau {which means “hairy”}.” Consider whether or not to include the meaning of Esau’s name in the text or in a footnote. (See: translate-names)


Gen 25:26 Then after that, his brother came out and his hand was grabbing on to the heel of Esau, so he called his name Jacob. And Isaac {was} a son of 60 years when she bore them. 

Then after that, 
“Next” (See: grammar-connect-logic-sequential)

his brother came out 
“his brother was born”. Some languages have a specific term for a younger brother that fits here. See what you did in Gen 4:2.

and his hand was grabbing on to the heel of Esau,
“with his hand holding on {tightly} to Esau’s heel.” or “gripping Esau’s heel {tightly} with his hand.”

so he called his name 
“So they called/named him” or “So he was called/named”. See how you translated a similar clause in verse 25 that probably has the same meaning. 

Jacob.
“Jacob {which means “heel-grabber”}.” If you decide to include the meaning of Jacob’s name in the text or in a footnote, make sure it matches the way you translate “grabbing” earlier in this sentence. (See: translate-names)

And Isaac {was} a son of 60 years 
“Isaac {was} 60 years old”. See how you translated the idiom “was a son of...years” in verse 20. (See: figs-idiom)

when she bore them.
“when Rebekah gave birth to them.” or “when Esau and Jacob were born.”


25:27-34 Esau Sells His Birthright To Jacob

Gen 25:27 Then the boys grew up, and Esau became a man who knew hunting, a man of the field, and Jacob {was} a quiet man who stayed among the tents.

Then the boys grew up, and 
“When/As the boys grew up/older,”

Esau became a man who knew hunting, 
“Esau became a skilled/expert hunter,” or “Esau became good at hunting animals {for food},” See how you translated a similar phrase (“mighty hunter”) in Gen 10:9.

a man of the field, 
“and he enjoyed/preferred {being/working in} the open country,” or “and he was an outdoorsman,”

and Jacob {was} a quiet man
“but/whereas Jacob {was} a quiet/mild-mannered man/person” or “Jacob, on the other hand, had a quiet/mild-mannered personality/character”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Also, make sure that it is clear in your translation that Esau and Jacob are being contrasted. (See: grammar-connect-logic-contrast)

who stayed among the tents.
“and stayed/worked close to home.” or “and {liked/preferred} to be/work at/near home.”


Gen 25:28 And Isaac loved Esau, because {he liked} game meat in his mouth, but Rebekah loved Jacob.

And Isaac loved Esau, 
“Isaac loved Esau {most},” or “Isaac’s favorite son was Esau,” Your translation should not sound like Isaac and Rebekah did not love both of their sons. Rather, they each had their favorite son.

because {he liked} game meat in his mouth, 
“because he liked to eat the meat of wild animals/deer {that he/Esau hunted},” Make sure your translation of “he liked” refers here to Isaac, not Esau. For some languages it is clearer or more natural to put this clause first in this sentence and say, “Isaac liked to eat wild animal/deer meat, so his favorite son was Esau”. Do what is best your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

but Rebekah loved Jacob.
“but/whereas Rebekah loved Jacob {most}.” or “but/whereas Rebekah’s favorite son was Jacob.” See how you translated a similar clause earlier in this verse.

Gen 25:29 Now Jacob was cooking stew, and Esau came in from the field and he {was} exhausted.

Now Jacob was cooking stew, and
“{Once} Jacob was making/cooking {some} stew/soup, and” or “{One day} when Jacob was making {some} stew/soup,” According to verse 34, this stew (or thick soup) was made out of lentils, which are a type of bean; it may also have had pieces of meat in it. Consider what is the best way in your language to introduce the first event in this episode (following the background information in verses 27-28). (See: writing-newevent)

Esau came in from the field 
“Esau came home from {hunting/working out in} the fields/country”. See how you translated “field” in verse 27.

and he {was} exhausted.
“and he {was/felt} exhausted/weak {from hunger}.” or “and he {was/felt} exhausted/weak {and hungry}.” or “extremely/very tired {and hungry}.” The Hebrew word for “exhausted” means Esau was very tired (perhaps even feeling faint) from his hunting or work, as well as hungry and thirsty from lack of food. Some languages have an idiom for this that fits well here. Do what is best in your language.


Gen 25:30 Then Esau said to Jacob, “Please let me devour some of that very red stuff because I {am} exhausted!” For that {reason} they called his name Edom.

Then Esau said to Jacob, 
“So Esau asked Jacob,” or “So Esau requested from Jacob,” Consider what is the best way in your language to translate this quote margin. (See: writing-quotations)

“Please let me devour 
“Please let me eat/have”

some of that very red stuff 
“some of that very/dark red stew/soup {you are making}”

because I {am} exhausted!
“because I {am/feel} exhausted/weak {from hunger}!” or “because I {am/feel} {hungry and} exhausted/weak!” See how you translated “exhausted” in verse 29.

For that {reason} 
“That is why” or “Because he/Esau said that,”

they called his name 
“he/Esau was/is {also} called/nicknamed” or “his/Esau’s nickname was” or “they/people called/nicknamed him”

Edom.
“Edom, {which means “red.”}” You could include the meaning of “Edom” in your translation or in a footnote so that it is clear why Esau was given that name. (See: translate-names)


Gen 25:31 But Jacob said, “On this day sell your birthright to me.”

But Jacob said, 
“But Jacob said/replied {to him},” or “Jacob replied,” (See: writing-quotations)

On this day
“Today {right now} or “Right now” or “First”

sell your birthright to me.”
“give your birthright to me in exchange {for some stew/soup}.” or “trade your rights as the firstborn/oldest son to me {for the/some stew/soup,} {then I will give you some}.” Make sure it is clear in your translation that Jacob was offering the stew as payment for Esau’s birthright as the firstborn son. In Hebrew culture the firstborn son inherited twice as much as the rest of the children in the family (Deuteronomy 21:15-17). That information could be put in a footnote so that people understand what Esau was selling for a bowl of stew. (See: figs-explicit)


Gen 25:32 And Esau said, “Behold, I am about to die! So for what use {is} that to me, a birthright?”

And Esau said, 
“Esau said/responded {to him},” (See: writing-quotations)

“Behold, I am about to die!
“Look, I am about to die {from hunger}!” or “Look/Listen, {I am so hungry that I feel like} I am about/going to die!” Esau is using hyperbole or exaggeration here to emphasize how hungry he is. (See: figs-hyperbole)

So for what use {is} that to me, a birthright?
“So how will my birthright benefit me {if I die}?” or “So my birthright is of no use/value/benefit to me {right now}!” Esau uses a rhetorical question to emphasize his point about how hungry he is. Consider whether or not a rhetorical question works well here in your language. (See: figs-rquestion)


Gen 25:33 But Jacob said, “Swear to me on this day!” So he swore to him and sold his birthright to Jacob. 

But Jacob said,
“Jacob insisted,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Swear to me on this day!”
“{First} make an oath/vow to me today {before God} {that your rights are now mine}!” or “{You must first} vow/promise to me right now {that you sell/give your rights to me}.” See how you translated “swear to me by God” in Gen 21:23. (See: figs-explicit)

So he swore to him 
“So he/Esau swore/vowed to him/Jacob” or “So Esau made an unbreakable promise/vow to him/Jacob”. Make sure the way you translate this clause fits well with what Jacob just said.

and sold his birthright to Jacob.
“that he had sold/traded his rights as the firstborn/oldest son to Jacob/him {for the stew/soup}.” or “that he was selling/giving his firstborn-son-rights to Jacob/him {in exchange for the stew/soup}.” See how you translated “sell your birthright” in verse 31. Also see how Hebrews 12:16 is translated, which refers to the same event.


Gen 25:34 Then Jacob gave to Esau bread and lentil stew, and he ate and drank, and got up and left. So Esau despised his birthright. 

Then Jacob gave to Esau bread and lentil stew
“Then Jacob gave Esau {some} bread and {some of the} lentil stew/soup” or “Then Jacob gave Esau {some of the} lentil stew/soup and/with {some} bread”. Consider again how you translated “stew/soup” in verses 29 and 34. Lentils are small, round, flat, reddish-brown legume seeds that grow inside a pod (similar to peas or beans). If lentils are not known in your area, you could describe them as “a type of legume/bean called lentils”. (See: translate-unknown)

and he ate and drank, and got up and left.
“and Esau ate, drank, got/stood up and left.” or “and Esau {quickly/hurriedly} ate the meal and left.” Consider what is the most natural way to translate this series of actions that happened quickly one after the other and shows how flippantly Esau treated his birthright.

So Esau despised his birthright.
“So Esau showed that he did not value his rights as the firstborn/oldest son.” or “In that way, Esau treated his birthright {carelessly/flippantly} as if it had no value.” See how you translated “birthright” in verses 31-33.


26 

26:1-5 God Establishes His Covenant With Isaac

Gen 26:1 Then there was a famine in the land, besides the earlier famine that was in the days of Abraham. So Isaac went to Abimelech, the king of the Philistines, to Gerar.

Then there was 
“Then/Now there was”. Consider what is the best way in your language to begin this new episode. (See: writing-newevent)

a famine
“{another} famine” or “{another} extreme/serious shortage/lack of food” or “{another} {time of} extreme/severe food shortage”. See how you translated “famine” in Gen 12:10.
in the land,
“in the/that country/region” 

besides the earlier famine that was 
“in addition to the previous famine/one/shortage that occurred/happened” or “{This was} a different famine/shortage from the one that had happened {years} earlier/before,”

in the days of Abraham.
“during Abraham’s lifetime.” or “while Abraham was still alive.”

So Isaac 
“So Isaac {and his family}”. In your translation it should not sound like Isaac went alone to the city of Gerar; the rest of his family lived with him. (See: figs-explicit)

went to Abimelech, the king of the Philistines,
“went {for help} to {King} Abimelech, {who was} the king over the Philistines.” or “went to {King} Abimelech, who ruled the Philistines, {to ask him for help}.” See how you translated “Philistines” in Gen 10:14; 21:32, 34.

to Gerar.
“{He/Abimelech lived} in {the city of} Gerar.” or “{He/Abimelech ruled} from {the city of} Gerar{, which was the Philistines’ capital city}.” King Abimelech ruled all the Philistines from Gerar, their capital city. Make sure your translation does not sound like the only Philistines he ruled were the ones who lived in Gerar. For some languages it may be clearer to put the location (Gerar) earlier in this sentence and say, “So Isaac went to {the city of} Gerar to {ask for help from} King Abimelech who ruled over the Philistines.” Do what is best in your language. Also be consistent here with how you translated “{the city of} Gerar” in Gen 10:19; 20:1-2. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 26:2 Then Yahweh appeared to him and said, “Do not go down to Egypt; live in the land that I tell you.

Then Yahweh appeared to him
“Then Yahweh came to Isaac”. See how you translated “appeared” in Gen 12:7. Also consider whether it is more natural in your language to refer to Isaac here with his name or a pronoun. (See: writing-pronouns)

and said,
“and said {to him},” or “and told/commanded {him},” Consider what is the best way in your language to translate this quote margin. (See: writing-quotations)

“Do not go down
“Do not go/travel south” or “Do not go/travel”. Egypt was lower in elevation and also south of the land of the Philistines. Many translations leave that information implied. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-explicit)

to Egypt;
“to {the land/country of} Egypt” 

live in the land that I tell you.
“{rather} live/stay/reside in the/this land where/wherever I tell you {to live}.” or “{rather} live where/wherever I tell you to live.”


Gen 26:3 Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you and bless you. For to you and to your offspring I will give all these lands, and I will confirm the oath that I swore to Abraham your father.

Sojourn 
“You must live/stay/reside for a while” or “Live/Stay/Reside temporarily {as a foreigner/outsider}”. See how you translated this term in Gen 12:10 and 19:9. You may need to translate it slightly differently, depending on the context.

in this land,
“in this region,”

and I will be with you 
“and I will stay with you” or “and I will be/stay {right} beside you”. This means that God will guide, help, and protect Isaac, and provide for his needs.

and bless you.
“and prosper you.” or “cause you {and your family} to prosper.” (See: translate-keyterms)

For to you and to your offspring I will give all these lands,
“In fact, I will give all the {surrounding} lands/regions to you and your offspring/descendants,” Starting here (through verse 4) Yahweh explains how he will bless Isaac. Begin this sentence in a way that makes that clear in your translation. (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)

and I will confirm 
“and I will continue to keep/fulfill”

the oath that I swore to Abraham your father.
“the vow/promise that I made to your father Abraham.” Consider again how you translated “oath” in Gen 24:8 and 26:3.


Gen 26:4 And I will multiply your offspring as the stars of the heavens, and I will give to your offspring all these lands. And in your offspring all the nations of the earth will be blessed,

And I will 
“Yes, I will” or “I will”. Verse 4 gives the details of the oath that is referred to in verse 3.

multiply your offspring as
“multiply/increase {the number of} your offspring/descendants {so that they are as numerous/countless} as” or “make your offspring/descendants as numerous/many/countless as” or “give you so many offspring that they will be as numerous as”. See how you translated a similar clause in Gen 22:17. (See: figs-simile)

the stars of the heavens, 
“the {number of} stars in the sky,” 

and I will give 
“I will also give”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

to your offspring 
“to your descendants” or “to them”

all these lands.
“all these regions.” See how you translated this phrase in verse 3.

And 
“In fact,”

in your offspring
“through your offspring/descendants” or “because of your offspring/descendants” or “by means of your offspring/descendants”. See how you translated this phrase and the following clause in Gen 22:18.

all the nations of the earth will be blessed,
“all the people/ethnic groups on earth will be blessed {by me},” or “{I} will bless all the people/ethnic groups on the earth,” Consider what is the best way in your language to translate this passive clause. (See: figs-activepassive)


Gen 26:5 because Abraham obeyed my voice and kept my requirements, my commands, my decrees, and my laws.”

because
“{all} because” or “{I will do all that} because”. Verse 5 gives the reason that Yahweh will do everything that he says in verses 3 and 4. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

Abraham obeyed my voice 
“Abraham obeyed me” or “Abraham {always} obeyed/did what I told him”. The phrase “my voice” stands for what Yahweh said to Abraham and also represents Yahweh himself. (See: figs-metonymy)

and kept my requirements, my commands, my decrees, and my laws.”
“Yes, he kept/obeyed all my requirements, {including} {all} my commands, decrees, and laws.” or “and did everything that I ever commanded {him} {to do}.” This clause is another way of saying “obeyed my voice” in the previous clause, and emphasizes that Abraham always obeyed God in everything. Notice that the terms in this clause have much overlap in meaning. (See: figs-parallelism)


26:6-11 Isaac Lies About His Wife Rebekah To The Philistines

Gen 26:6 So Isaac stayed in Gerar.

So Isaac 
“So/Then Isaac {did/obeyed what God said/commanded and}”

stayed in Gerar.
“stayed/settled {with his family} in {the city of} Gerar.” In your translation it should not sound like Isaac lived alone; the rest of his family lived with him. (See: figs-explicit)


Gen 26:7 Then the men of the place asked about his wife, and he said, “She {is} my sister,” because he was afraid to say, “{She is} my wife.” {He thought,} “Lest the men of the place kill me on account of Rebekah, because she {is} beautiful of appearance.”

Then the men
“After a while the men” or “When the men”

of the place
“of/from that place/city” or “from there” 

asked about his wife, and
“started asking {Isaac/him} about Rebekah,”

he said, 
“he said/replied {to them}” or “he {lied and} told {them}” or “he {deceived them by} saying” (See: writing-quotations)

“She {is} my sister,”
“that she {was} his sister”. Consider whether it is more natural in your language to use a direct quote or an indirect quote here. (See: figs-quotations)

because he was afraid to say, “{She is} my wife.”
“He was afraid to say/admit that she was his wife,” Consider whether or not it is more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here. Also see how you handled the previous quote in this sentence. (See: figs-quotations)

{He thought,} “Lest the men of the place kill me
“He thought that the men of the/that city might kill him” or “He was afraid that the men in that place/city would kill him“. See how you translated “the men of the place” earlier in this verse. Also consider whether it is better in your language to use a direct or indirect quote here, and see what you did earlier in this verse. (See: figs-quotations)

on account of Rebekah,
“because of Rebekah,” or “so that they could take/have Rebekah,” 

because she {is} beautiful of appearance.”
“because she {is/was} very/so beautiful.” It may be more natural to put this clause first in this verse and say, “Now Rebekah {was} very beautiful, so the men in that city started asking {Isaac} about her. Isaac was afraid they might kill him in order to take/have her, so he {lied and} told {them} she {was} his sister.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 26:8 Then it happened when the days had been long for him there, then Abimelech the king of the Philistines looked down from a window and saw that behold, Isaac was laughing with Rebekah his wife.

Then it happened when the days had been long for him there, 
“{One day} when/after he/Isaac {and his family} had been/lived there a long time,”

then Abimelech the king of the Philistines 
“Abimelech {who was} king over the Philistines” or “the Philistines’ King Abimelech” or “King Abimelech”

looked down from a window
“looked down/out from a window {of his house/palace}”

and saw that behold, 
“and saw to his surprise” or “and was surprised to see”. In this context, “behold” means that King Abimelech was surprised at what he saw.

Isaac was laughing with Rebekah his wife.
“that Isaac was flirting with his wife Rebekah.” or “that Isaac was showing affection to his wife Rebekah.” There is a word play here in Hebrew (since “Isaac” and “laughing” come from the same root word). Isaac may have been laughing or flirting with Rebekah or physically touching her in an affectionate or intimate way, as a husband would do with his wife.


Gen 26:9 So Abimelech called for Isaac and said, “Behold, she {is} really your wife! So how could you say, ‘She {is} my sister’?” And Isaac said to him, “Because I said, ‘I might die because of her.’ ” 

So Abimelech called for Isaac 
“So/Then {King} Abimelech summoned Isaac” or “So/Then {King} Abimelech sent someone to bring Isaac to him”. King Abimelech probably sent a servant to tell Isaac that he wanted him to come talk to him.

and said,
“and said {to him},” or “and scolded {him} {by saying},” Consider what is the best way to translate this quote margin in your language. (See: writing-quotations)

“Behold, she {is} really your wife!
“It is clear/obvious that she/Rebekah {is} actually your wife!” The word “behold” emphasizes what follows it. Consider what is the best way in your language to translate this term in this context. (See: translate-keyterms)

So how could you say, ‘She {is} my sister’?” 
“So why did you tell us that she {is} your sister?” Consider whether it is more natural in your language to translate the embedded direct quote (“She is my sister”) with an indirect quote. (See: figs-quotesinquotes)

And Isaac said to him,
“Isaac answered him,” Consider what is the best way in your language to translate this quote margin. (See: writing-quotations)

Because I said, ‘I might die because of her.’ ”
“Because I thought that I might die because of her.“ or “{I said that} because I was afraid that someone might kill me in order to take/have her {as a wife}.” Consider whether it is better in your language to translate this embedded quote as a direct or indirect quote. (See: figs-quotesinquotes)


Gen 26:10 Then Abimelech said, “What {is} this you have done to us? One of the people might easily have lain with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us!”

Then Abimelech said, 
“Then Abimelech scolded {him} {further},” Consider what is the best way to translate this quote margin in your language to fit this context. (See: writing-quotations)

“What {is} this you have done to us? 
“Why did you treat us this way?” or “You have treated us very badly!” or “You should not have done this to us!” King Abimelech uses a rhetorical question here to show strong emotion and to emphasize that what Isaac did was wrong and should not have been done. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-rquestion)

One of the people might easily have 
“Sooner or later, one of the people/men {whom I rule} could/might have”

lain with your wife,
“slept with your wife,” or “had {physical/sexual} relations with your wife,” or “committed adultery with your wife,” See how you translated the idiom “lay with” in Gen 19:32-35. It may be necessary to translate this in slightly different ways, depending on the context. (See: figs-euphemism)

and you would have brought guilt on us!”
“with the result that you would have brought guilt/punishment on us!” or “and you would have caused us to be guilty {of adultery}!” The pronoun “us” in this verse refers to King Abimelech and the Philistines whom he ruled; it does not include Isaac. (See: figs-exclusive)


Gen 26:11 Then Abimelech ordered all the people by saying, “Whoever touches this man or his wife will surely be killed!” 

Then Abimelech ordered all the people by saying, 
“Then {King} Abimelech warned/told all {his} people,” 

“Whoever touches this man or his wife will surely be killed!”
“If anyone harms this man {Isaac} or his wife {in any way}, I will surely/definitely have that person killed/executed!” or “I will surely/definitely execute anyone who harms Isaac or his wife {in any way}!” In this context “touches” is used as an idiom that means “harms {in any way}”. Many languages have a similar idiom that fits well here. (See: figs-idiom)


26:12-33 Isaac Has Conflict With The Philistines Over His Wells

Gen 26:12 Then Isaac sowed seeds in that land, and in that year he acquired a hundredfold, and Yahweh blessed him.

Then Isaac sowed seeds in that land, 
“Isaac planted seeds/crops in that area,” To “sow seeds” means to plant seeds by scattering them by hand on the ground. If this method of planting is not known in your language area, you could translate this more generally and say, “planted seeds/crops” or “planted {large} fields”.

and in that year 
“and during that year” or “and that year” 

he acquired a hundredfold,
“he gathered/reaped {a huge harvest that was} a hundred times {more than what he had planted}” or “he harvested a very large crop/harvest”

and Yahweh blessed him.
“because Yahweh blessed him.” or “Yahweh continued to bless him,” Consider whether or not it is more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here that continues into verse 13.


Gen 26:13 And the man became great, and he continued to become even greater until he was exceedingly great.

And the man became great, and he continued to become even greater 
“In that way he/Isaac kept getting more and more wealthy” or “so that he grew/became richer and richer”

until he was exceedingly great.
“until {eventually} he was extremely/very wealthy/rich.”


Gen 26:14 And he had possession of flocks and possession of herds and many servants. So the Philistines envied him, 

And he had possession of flocks and possession of herds 
“He had/owned many flocks {of sheep} and herds {of cattle}” or “He had/owned many sheep and cattle”. See how you translated “flocks” and “herds” in Gen 24:35.

and many servants. 
“and {he also had/owned} many servants/slaves.” or “He also had/owned many servants/slaves.” The same Hebrew word is used for both “servant” or “slave”. Slaves and servants were owned by their masters but often they were treated as respected members of the family. An example of this was Abraham’s head servant who was sent to find a wife for Isaac (Gen 24). Keep this information in mind as you translate “servants” into your language. (See: translate-key-terms)

So 
“As a result,” or “Because of that,” (See: grammar-connect-logic-result)

the Philistines envied him,
“the Philistines were envious/jealous of him/Isaac” 


Gen 26:15 and the Philistines stopped up all the wells that the servants of his father had dug in the days of Abraham his father and filled them with dirt.

and the Philistines stopped up all the wells that the servants of his father had dug in the days of Abraham his father and filled them with dirt.
“and/so they stopped/plugged up all his father Abraham’s wells by filling them with dirt.” or “So they filled up with dirt all the wells that the servants of his father Abraham had dug while he was {still} alive.” or “and/so they filled up all his/Isaac’s wells with dirt {so that no one could use them anymore}. Those were the wells that Abraham’s servants had dug while he was still alive.” See how you translated “well” in Gen 21:30-31. (See: figs-infostructure)

Gen 26:16 Then Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from us, because you are more powerful than we {are}.”

Then Abimelech said to Isaac,
“Then/Finally {King} Abimelech said to Isaac/him,” Consider what is the best way to translate this quote margin in your language. (See: writing-quotations)

“Go away from us, 
“{Please} move away from us,” or “{We want you to} move {somewhere else} away from us,” Although King Abimelech is asking Isaac to leave, he is still trying to be polite. (See: figs-politeness)

because you are more powerful than we {are}.”
“because you are too powerful for us.” or “because you are so powerful {that you are a threat} to us.” For some languages it is more natural to put this clause first in this quote and say, “You are so powerful that we {are afraid of you and} want you to move away from us.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 26:17 So Isaac went from there and camped in the Valley of Gerar and settled there.

So Isaac went from there
“So Isaac moved {away} from {the city of} Gerar {with his family}”. In your translation it should not sound like Isaac moved by himself from the city of Gerar; his family moved with him. See what you did for a similar case in verse 1. (See: figs-explicit)

and camped 
“and pitched his tents” or “and set up his tents” 

in the Valley of Gerar 
“in the Gerar Valley” or “in the valley near Gerar”

and settled there.
“and stayed/lived there {for a while}.”


Gen 26:18 Then Isaac returned and dug out the water wells that they had dug in the days of Abraham his father and that the Philistines had stopped up after the death of Abraham, and he called them names like the names that his father had called them.

Then Isaac returned and dug out the water wells that they had dug in the days of Abraham his father and
“Then Isaac {had his servants} dig the dirt out of the wells that Abraham’s servants had dug and” or “Then Isaac’s servants re-dug his father Abraham’s wells”. Isaac had his servants re-dig the wells; he did not do that work by himself. (See: figs-metonymy) 

that the Philistines had stopped up after the death of Abraham, 
“that the Philistines had plugged up with dirt after Abraham had died,” or “that the Philistines had {just} filled {with dirt},” Be consistent with how you spelled or translated “Philistines” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 10:14; 21:32, 34; 26:1, 8, 14-15, 18. (See: translate-names)

and he called them names like the names
“He/Isaac gave the/those wells the same names” or “He/Isaac named the/those wells with the same names”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

that his father had called them.
“that his father had named/given them.”

Gen 26:19 Then the servants of Isaac dug in the valley and found a well of living water there.

Then the servants of Isaac dug in the valley 
“Next Isaac’s servants dug {at/in a new place} in the valley {of Gerar}” (See: figs-explicit)

and found a well of living water there.
“and discovered/struck/reached a source/spring of fresh/flowing water there.” The phrase “living water” is an idiom that means the well was spring fed and was a source of continually flowing, fresh water to drink. (See: figs-idiom)


Gen 26:20 But the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with the herdsmen of Isaac, saying, “The water {belongs} to us!” So he called the name of the well Esek, because they disputed with him.

But the herdsmen of Gerar 
“But the herdsmen from {the city of} Gerar”

quarreled with the herdsmen of Isaac, saying,
“argued/disputed with Isaac’s herdsmen and said/claimed”

“The water {belongs} to us!” 
“That well is ours!” or “that the water/well belonged to them.” or “that they owned that water/well.” Consider whether it is best in your language to use a direct quote or an indirect quote here. (See: figs-quotations)

So he called the name of the well 
“So Isaac named/called the/that well”

Esek,
“Esek, {which means “dispute/argument,”}” If you include the meaning of this well in your translation or in a footnote, make sure it fits with how you translate “disputed” in the next clause. This word is different from the word for “quarreled” earlier in verse 20 but it has the same meaning. (See: translate-names)

because they disputed with him.
“because they argued with him {about it}.” or “because they disputed/argued with his herdsmen {about it}.” The herdsmen from Gerar disputed with Isaac indirectly (verse 20b) when they quarreled with his herdsmen (verse 20a). Make sure in your translation that the two halves of this verse do not contradict each other.

Gen 26:21 Then they dug another well, but they quarreled over it too, so he called its name Sitnah.

Then they dug another well, 
“Then Isaac’s servants dug another well,”

but they quarreled over it too, 
“but {once again} the herdsmen from Gerar argued/disputed {with them} about that one/well too,” Be consistent here with how you translated “quarreled” in the first part of verse 20.

Then he moved from there 
“Then Isaac {and his family} moved from there”. In your translation it should not sound like Isaac moved by himself; his family moved with him. (See: figs-explicit)

and he dug 
“and he {had his servants/men} dig” or “and his servants dug”. See how you translated a similar phrase in verse 18.

“a new/third well,”

and they did not quarrel over it,
“but {this time} the herdsmen of/from Gerar did not quarrel/argue about it,” 

so he called its name 
“so he called/named it” or “so he called/named the/that well” or “so he gave it the name”. See how you translated this clause in verses 20 and 21.

Rehoboth,
“Rehoboth, {which means “space/room,”}” Be consistent here with how you spelled “Rehoboth” in Gen 10:11.

and he said, “Because now Yahweh 
“because he said, “Now/Finally Yahweh”

has made space for us
“has provided space/room for us” or “given our/my family {enough} space/room {to live}”

“so that we will prosper/flourish {here} in the/this land.”

Gen 26:23 Then from there he went up to Beersheba.

Then from there he went up to Beersheba.
“From there he/Isaac {and his family} went/moved south to {the city of} Beersheba.” or “{One day} he/Isaac {and his family} went/moved from there to {the city of} Beersheba.” The word “up” refers to the fact that Beersheba is higher in elevation from where they were; it is also south in direction. Some translations leave that information implied. Do what is best in your language.


Gen 26:24 And Yahweh appeared to him during that night and said, “I {am} the God of Abraham your father. Do not be afraid, because I {am} with you. And I will bless you and multiply your offspring for the sake of Abraham my servant.”

And Yahweh appeared to him during that night and said,
“That night Yahweh appeared/came to him and said {to him},” See how you translated “Yahweh appeared to him” in verse 2.

“I {am} the God of Abraham your father. 
“I {am} the God whom your father Abraham serves/worships.” or “I {am} the God {who takes care} of your father Abraham.”

Do not be afraid, because I {am} with you. 
“I {will always be} with you, so do not be afraid.” Some languages can do like the Hebrew text does and put the result clause (“do not be afraid”) before the reason (“I am with you”). Other languages prefer to put the reason before the result. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

And I will bless you 
“I will bless/prosper you”. See how you translated this phrase in verse 3. (See: translate-key-terms)

and multiply your offspring
“and multiply/increase {the number of} your offspring/descendants” or “and make your offspring/descendants numerous” or “and give you many/countless offspring/descendants”. See how you translated this phrase in verse 4.

for the sake of 
“because of {my promise/relationship to}” or “just as I promised to” or “in order to keep my promise to” 

Abraham my servant.”
“my servant Abraham.” or “Abraham who serves me.”


Gen 26:25 Then he built an altar there and called on the name of Yahweh. And he pitched his tents there, and the servants of Isaac dug a well there.

Then he built an altar there 
“Then/So Isaac built an altar there {at Beersheba}”. See how you translated “altar” in Gen 22:9.

and called on the name of Yahweh. 
“and {offered/burned sacrifices on it to Yahweh as he} worshiped/praised Yahweh/him by name.” Consider again how you translated the idiom “called on the name of Yahweh” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 4:26, 12:8, 13:4, 21:33, 26:25, and see the note about this at 4:26.

And he pitched his tents there, 
“He also set up his tents/camp there,” See how you translated a similar phrase in verse 17.

and the servants of Isaac dug a well there.
“and his servants started digging {another} well there {too}.” Notice that they did not finish digging this well until verse 32.

Gen 26:26 Then Abimelech came to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath his friend and Phicol the commander of his army.

Then Abimelech came to him from Gerar,
“Then {King} Abimelech came/went to him/Isaac from {the city of} Gerar” 

and Ahuzzath his friend 
“with his adviser Ahuzzath”. King Abimelech’s friend Ahuzzath was probably his adviser. 

and Phicol the commander of his army.
“and Phicol {who was} the commander/leader of his/Abimelech’s army/soldiers.” or “and his army/military commander/captain Phicol.” See how you translated this phrase in Gen 21:22, 32. 


Gen 26:27 And Isaac said to them, “Why have you come to me, since you hate me and you sent me away from you?”

And Isaac said to them, 
“Isaac asked them,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Why have you come to me, 
“Why did you come here,” or “I don’t understand why you came to see me,” Isaac probably wants to know why King Abimelech and his men are there, but this may also be a rhetorical question that shows his strong emotion. (See: figs-rquestion)

since you hate me 
“{especially} since you have treated me hatefully/meanly” or “{especially}
 since you have been hateful/unfriendly/hostile toward me” 

and you sent me away from you?”
“and forced me to move away from you!”


Gen 26:28 And they said, “We have clearly seen that Yahweh has been with you, so we said, ‘There should be an oath between us’—between us and you. So let us cut a covenant with you,

And they said, 
“They answered {him},” or “They responded/replied,” (See: writing-quotations)

“We have clearly seen 
“It is very obvious/clear to us”. Make sure your translation of the pronoun “we” does not include Isaac here. (See: figs-exclusive)

that Yahweh has been with you, 
“that Yahweh is with you {and blessing/prospering you},” See how you translated a similar phrase in verses 3 and 24.

so we said, 
“so we said {to each other}” or “so/and we decided”

‘There should be an oath between us’—between us and you. 
“that there should be an oath/vow between us and you.” or “that we should make a vow with you {to live in peace with one another}.” or “that we should make a vow to each other.” In the Hebrew text, the first “us” in this sentence includes Isaac, but the second “us” excludes him. Notice that in the first two alternate translations, the “us” or the “we” exclude him, but in the third alternate translation, the “we” includes him. (See: figs-exclusive)

So let us cut a covenant 
“So {please} let us make/establish a {peace} treaty/agreement”. See how you translated “cut a covenant” in Gen 21:27, 32. Notice that the pronoun “us” in this phrase either excludes Isaac or includes him, depending on whether you use “with you” or “with each other” for the following phrase. (See: figs-exclusive)

with you,
“with each other,”


Gen 26:29 that you will not do evil against us, just as we did not touch you, and just as we did only good to you and sent you away in peace. Now you are blessed by Yahweh.”

that you will not do evil against us, 
“that you will never harm us,” Verse 29 specifies the details of the covenant or treaty that they want Isaac to vow or promise.

just as we did not touch you, 
“just as we never harmed you {in any way},” See how you translated “touch” or “harm” in verse 11. (See: figs-idiom)

and just as we did only good to you 
“but only treated you well/kindly”

and sent you away in peace.
“and sent you away peacefully.” or “and in a peaceful manner asked you to leave.”

“Now {because of that,}” or “{with the result that} now” or “{As a result,} now”

you are blessed by Yahweh.”
“Yahweh has {greatly} blessed/prospered you.”

Then he made a feast for them, 
“Then Isaac prepared a feast,”

and they ate and drank. 
“and they {all} ate and drank {together}.” In your translation it should not sound like the feast was only for King Abimelech and his men; Isaac ate with them.


Gen 26:31 Then they got up early in the morning and swore to each other. Then Isaac sent them on their way, and they left from him in peace.

Then they got up early in the morning
“Early the next morning they got up”. See how you translated “got up early in the morning” in Gen 20:8; 21:14, 22:3.

and swore to each other.
“made unbreakable oaths/promises to each other {to keep their covenant/treaty}.” or “and made vows/oaths to one another {that they would keep their treaty/agreement}.” See how you translated “swore” in Gen 25:33. Also, if you make the implied information explicit, it should match the way you translate “covenant” or “treaty” in verse 28.

Then Isaac sent them on their way,
“Then Isaac said goodbye to them,” or “Then Isaac told them goodbye,”

and they left from him in peace.
“and they went home from him in peace.” or “and they left him on peaceful terms and went/returned home.”

And Esau was a son of 40 years, and
“Now Esau was 40 years old and” or “When Esau was forty years old,” Consider again how you translated “a son of...years” in the book of Genesis. See 5:32; 11:10; 12:4; 16:16; 17:1, 17, 24-25; 25:20-21 and 26:34.

27:1-29 Jacob Steals Esau’s Blessing From Their Father Isaac

Gen 27:1 Then it happened, when Isaac was old and his eyes were too dim to see, then he called Esau his older son and said to him, “My son.” And he said to him, “Behold me.”

Then it happened, when
“One day when” or “Now when”. The events in chapter 27 happened about 23 years after the end of chapter 26. Make sure your translation begins this verse in a way that fits with that fact. (See: writing-newevent)

Isaac was old
“Isaac was {very} old” or “Isaac was an old man”

and his eyes were too dim to see,
“and his eyes were so weak that he could not see,” or “and he could no longer see,” or “and he was almost blind,” Isaac was either totally blind or so blind that he could not recognize people anymore (see verses 18-27, 32-33).

then he called 
“he called/sent for” or “he summoned”. Isaac probably had a servant go and tell Esau to come to him.

Esau his older son and said to him, “My son.”
“his older son Esau and said, “Son.” ” 

And he said to him, 
“Esau answered him,” or “Esau replied,” Consider what is the best way in your language to translate this quote margin. (See: writing-quotations)

So now, 
“So then,” or “So” (See: grammar-connect-logic-result)

please take your weapons, your quiver, and your bow, 
“take/get your hunting gear, your quiver {of arrows}, and your bow,” or “take/get your bow and arrows”. Consider what is the most natural way to refer to a bow and arrows in your language.

and go out 
“then go out” or “go out”

{in} the field 
“into/to the fields” or “into/to the open country”. See how you translated “the field” in Gen 25:27.

Then prepare 
“Next/Then {use the meat to} cook/make” or “Next/Then {butcher the animal/deer and} cook/make”. For some languages it may be necessary to make explicit more of the steps that Esau needs to take to prepare the meal, so that it does not sound like the animal would be eaten alive or uncooked. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-explicit)

And Rebekah was listening while Isaac spoke to Esau his son,
“Rebekah overheard what Isaac said to his/their son Esau” or “Now while Isaac was speaking to his son Esau, Rebekah was listening/eavesdropping”. The phrase “his son” probably recalls the fact that Esau was Isaac’s favorite son (Gen 25:28). However make sure that your translation of this phrase does not sound like Esau was not also Rebekah’s son. (See: figs-infostructure)

then Esau went {to} the field to hunt game to bring it back.
“So after Esau went out to the fields/country to hunt/get {wild} animal/deer {meat},” or “So after Esau had left to go hunting in the open country,” Consider whether it is more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here that continues into verse 6.

“Behold, 
“Listen,” or “Listen to this:”

I heard your father

and prepare tasty food for me so that I can eat it
“and {use it to} cook a tasty/delicious meal for him to eat.” See how you translated this clause in verse 4.

and I can bless you in the presence of Yahweh, before my death.’
“Then before he dies he wants to bless him/Esau in Yahweh’s presence.” or “Then before he dies, he will ask Yahweh to bless/prosper Esau.” Be consistent in translating the parts of verse 7 as either a direct quote (using first person pronouns) or an indirect quote (using third person pronouns).

Gen 27:8 So now, my son, listen to my voice, to what I command you.

So now, my son,  
“So then, my son,” or “Now son,” See how you translated “So now” in verse 3. Also, make sure it is clear that Rebekah is no longer quoting Isaac’s words (whether directly or indirectly). If necessary, you could begin this verse with: “Rebekah continued,” or “Then Rebekah said {to Jacob},”

Gen 27:12 Suppose my father touches me? Then I will be in his eyes as a deceiver, and I will bring a curse on me and not a blessing.”

Suppose 
“What if” or “What will/would happen if” or “{I am afraid of} what will happen if” 

my father touches me?
“my father touches/feels my skin/arms”. If this sentence is translated as a statement, you could end it with a period or an exclamation point to show that Jacob is worried.

Then I will be in his eyes as a deceiver, 
“{Certainly} he will/would {recognize me and} know/realize that I am trying to deceive/trick him.” Make sure that your translation of verse 12 describes a hypothetical situation, not something that had happened yet. Some languages have a special verb form (such as “would”) to communicate this. (See: figs-hypo)

“Let your curse be on me, my son.
“My son, {if your father curses you,} may that curse be/fall on me {and not on you}.” or “{If that happens,} may God curse me instead of you, my son.” Make sure that your translation of “your curse” refers to the curse Jacob fears his father might say against him, and does not sound like Jacob cursed someone. Also, for some languages it is more natural to put an address like “my son” first in this quote. Do what is best in your language.

 Gen 27:15 Then Rebekah took the best clothes of Esau her older son that {were} with her in the house and put them on Jacob her younger son.

Then Rebekah 
“Rebekah/She also”

took the best clothes of Esau her older son
“took/got {out} her older son Esau’s best/finest clothes”

that {were} with her in the house 
“that she had in the house”

and put them on Jacob her younger son.  
“and had her younger son Jacob put them on.” or “and gave them to her younger son Jacob to put on.” Your translation should not sound like Rebekah dressed Jacob herself as if he were a little child. She probably gave him the clothes and asked him to put them on himself.


Gen 27:16 And she put the skins of the kid goats over his hands and over the smooth part of his neck.

And she put the skins of the kid goats over his hands and over
“Then she used the goat skins to cover his/Jacob’s arms and”. See how you translated “skins” in Gen 3:21. The skins still had the goat hair or fur on them.

the smooth part of his neck.
“the non-hairy part of his neck.” or “the part of his neck that had no hair {on it}.” See how you translated “smooth” in verse 11.

Gen 27:17 Then she gave the tasty food and the bread that she had made into the hand{s} of Jacob her son, 

Then she gave the tasty food and the bread that she had made into the hand{s} of Jacob her son,
“Then she/Rebekah gave/handed to Jacob/him the tasty/savory goat meat dish and some bread she had baked/made.” or “Then she gave/handed the tasty/delicious food/meal to Jacob/him, including some bread that she had baked/made.”


Gen 27:18 and he went to his father and said, “My father.” And he said, “Behold me. Who {are} you, my son?” 

and he went to his father 
“He/Jacob took the meal to his father”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

and said, “My father.” And he said, 
“and said, “Father.” His father answered/replied,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Behold me. Who {are} you, my son?”
“Here I am, my son. Who {are} you?” or “Yes? Which {one} of my sons {are} you?” See how you translated “Behold me” in verse 1. It may be necessary to translate this differently here because the context is different.


Gen 27:19 Then Jacob said to his father, “I {am} Esau, your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please get up, sit and eat some of my game, so that your soul will bless me.” 

Then Jacob said to his father,
“Jacob replied/lied to his father,” (See: writing-quotations)

“I {am} Esau, your firstborn. 
“I {am} Esau, your firstborn/oldest son.” The term “firstborn” is a key term in the Bible because the firstborn son had special rights, including the fact that he inherited his father’s authority and the largest portion of his father’s estate. Jacob is claiming those rights by using this term. See how you translated this term in Gen 25:13. (See: translate-key-terms)

I have done as you told me. 
“I have done what you told/requested me {to do}.”

Please get up, sit and eat some of my game, 
“{So now,} please sit up and eat some of the game/deer {meat} that I have prepared/cooked {for you},” See how you translated “game {meat}” in verses 3, 5 and 7.

so that your soul will bless me.”
“so that you can bless me.” See how you translated a similar clause in verse 4.


Gen 27:20 Then Isaac said to his son, “How {is} this you were quick to find {it}, my son?” And he said, “Because Yahweh your God caused {it} to happen before me.”

Then Isaac said to his son,
“But Isaac asked him,” (See: writing-quotations)

“How {is} this you were quick to find {it}, my son?” 
“How were you able to find/get {the deer/animal} so quickly, my son?” Consider whether it is more natural in your language to put the address “my son” first in this quote.

And he said, 
“Jacob answered {him},”

“Because Yahweh your God 
“{I was successful} because Yahweh, the God you worship/serve,” or “Yahweh, {who is} the God who takes care of you,”

caused {it} to happen before me.”
“helped me to hunt/find it.” or “helped me to succeed.” or “brought it to me.” See how you translated this clause in Gen 24:12.

Gen 27:21 Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come close, so that I can touch you, my son, {and know} whether you are really my son Esau or not.”

Then Isaac said to Jacob, 
“Then/But Isaac said to him,”

“Please come close, so that I can touch you, my son,
“Please come close/closer {to me}, my son, so that I can touch/feel you” or “My son, please come here so that I can touch/feel you”. Consider whether it is more natural in your language to put the address “my son” first or earlier in this quote. Also see what you did in verses 13 and 20.

{and know} whether you are really my son Esau or not.”
“and make/be sure/certain that you are really my son Esau.” or “{I want to know} {for sure} whether or not you really are my son Esau.” Consider whether it is more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here.


Gen 27:22 So Jacob went close to Isaac his father, and he touched him and said, “The voice {is} the voice of Jacob, but the hands {are} the hands of Esau.”

So Jacob went close to Isaac his father,
“So/Then Jacob came/stepped close/closer to his father Isaac,”

and he touched him 
“and his father touched/felt him” or “and his father touched/felt his hands/arms”. See how you translated “touch” or “feel” in verses 12 and 21.

and said,
“and said/thought {to himself},” 

“The voice {is} the voice of Jacob, 
“{Hmm,} the/his voice {sounds like} Jacob’s voice,” or “{Hmm,} he sounds/talks like Jacob,” (See: figs-metonymy)

but the hands {are} the hands of Esau.” 
“but the/his hands/arms {feel like} Esau’s hands/arms.” or “but he feels like Esau.” In Hebrew, the word for “hand” is the same word as for “arm”. Isaac probably felt Esau’s hands and arms.


Gen 27:23 So he did not recognize him because his hands were hairy like the hands of Esau his brother, and he was about to bless him.

So he did not recognize him because his hands were hairy like the hands of Esau his brother,
“So Isaac was not able to recognize/identify who he/Jacob was because his/Jacob’s hand/arms were/felt hairy like his brother Esau’s.” or “Since Jacob’s hands/arms were/felt hairy like the hands/arms of his brother Esau, Isaac did not recognize him.” Be consistent here with how you translated “hands” or “arms” in verses 16 and 22. Also consider whether it is more natural in your language to change the original order of clauses in this sentence, as in the second alternate translation above. (See: figs-infostructure)

and he was about to bless him.  
“Then Isaac was about/prepared to bless him/Jacob,” or “Isaac was getting ready to bless him/Jacob,” Consider whether it is more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here that continues into verse 24.


Gen 27:24 But he said, “{Are} you really my son Esau?” And he said, “I {am}.” 

But he said, 
“But {he still was not sure/certain, so} he asked {him},” or “but {first} {he wanted to be completely sure/certain, so} he asked {him},”
 
“{Are} you really my son Esau?”
“Are you really/truly/actually my son Esau?”

And he said, 
“Jacob answered {him},” (See: writing-quotations)

“I {am}.”
“{Yes,} I am {Esau}.” or “{Yes, Father/sir,} I am.”


Gen 27:25 Then he said, “Bring {the food} to me, and I will eat some of my son’s game, so that my soul will bless you.” Then he brought {it} to him and he ate, and he brought wine to him and he drank.

Then he said, 
“So Isaac said {to him},” or “So his father said {to him},” (See: writing-quotations)

“Bring {the food} to me, 
“{Please} bring/serve me {the food/meal},” Your translation of Isaac’s request should sound polite, not rude or demanding. It should also not sound like he was begging or pleading. (See: figs-politeness)

and I will eat some of my son’s game, so that my soul will bless you.”
“so that I can eat some of your {wild} animal/deer {meat} and bless you.” See how you translated a similar clause in verse 19.

Then he brought {it} to him and he ate,
“Then Jacob brought/served {the meal} to his father and he ate it.”

and he brought wine to him and he drank.
“Jacob also brought/served him wine and he drank it.” See how you translated “wine” in Gen 19:32-35.

Gen 27:26 Then Isaac his father said to him, “Please come close and kiss me, my son.” 

Then Isaac his father said to him, 
“Then his/Jacob’s father said to him,” or “Then Isaac said to him/Jacob,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Please come close 
“Come here” or “Come closer/near {to me}”. See how you translated this phrase in verse 21. 

and kiss me, my son.”
It was a Hebrew custom for relatives and close friends to greet each other with a kiss on each cheek. Also consider whether it may be more natural in your language to put the address “my son” first in this quote.


Gen 27:27 So he went close and kissed him. And he smelled the smell of his clothes, so he blessed him and said, “See, the smell of my son {is} like the smell of a field that Yahweh has blessed! 

So he went close 
“So/Then he/Jacob came/stepped close/closer {to his father}”. See how you translated “went close” in verse 22.

and kissed him.
“and kissed him {on the/his cheek/cheeks}.”

And he smelled the smell of his clothes, 
“Then Isaac smelled/recognized the fragrance/scent of Esau’s clothes {that Jacob was wearing}” or “{As he/Jacob did that,} his father smelled/recognized the fragrance/scent of Esau’s clothes”

so he blessed him 
“Then he/Isaac blessed him/Jacob”

and said,
“by saying {to/about him},” or “He said {to/about him},”

“See, the smell of my son {is} like 
“Ahh, my son smells {wonderful} like” or “Ahh, my son, you smell {wonderful} like”. Some translations put the words of Isaac’s blessing in poetry format (beginning here and through verse 29). Be consistent here with how your translation team decides to format passages like this.

the smell of a field 
“the fragrance of a {green/productive} field” or “the way a {green/productive} field smells”

that Yahweh has blessed! 
“that Yahweh has caused to flourish!” or “that Yahweh has caused to be very productive!”


Gen 27:28 And may God give to you from the dew of the heavens and from the fatness of the earth, and an abundance of grain and wine. 

And may God give to you 
“May God give/provide you {and your descendants}” or “I ask God to provide you {and your descendants}” or “I pray that God will give/provide you {and your descendants}”. In the Hebrew text, “you” is singular in verses 28-29 and refers to both Jacob and his descendants. If necessary, you could make that explicit in your translation. (See: figs-metonymy)

from the dew of the heavens and from the fatness of the earth, and
“{plenty of} dew/rain from the heavens/sky {for your crops and animals} and riches from the earth/land/soil, including” or “{plenty of} rain and rich/fertile land/soil, so that {you have}”

an abundance of grain and wine. 
“an abundance of grain/food and wine/drink.” or “abundant harvests/food and {much} wine.” (See: figs-metonymy)


Gen 27:29 May peoples serve you, and may nations bow down to you. Be master over your brothers, and may the sons of your mother bow down to you. {May} those {who} curse you be cursed, and {may} those {who} bless you be blessed.” 

May peoples serve you, and may nations bow down to you. 
“May people groups serve you {and your descendants}, and may they bow down to you {in respect/submission}.” or “I also ask God to cause nations to serve and honor you {and your descendants}.” If possible in your language, it is best to keep both halves of this parallelism, which is used to emphasize what Isaac is saying to Jacob. (See: figs-parallelism)

Be master 
“May you rule” or “You will {even} rule”

over your brothers,
“over your brother and his descendants,” Jacob only had one brother, so this phrase refers here to Esau and his descendants.

and may the sons of your mother
“Yes, may your mother’s descendants” or “and they will” or “Yes, they {too} will”. This is another way of referring to Esau and his descendants. (See: figs-parallelism)

bow down to you. 
“bow down to you {in submission}.” or “{submit to you and} bow down to you.” or “show you complete respect.” Consider again how you translated the singular “you” in verses 28-29. You could use a plural “you” here or you could say “you {and your descendants}”. (See: figs-metonymy)

{May} those {who} curse you be cursed, and {may} those {who} bless you be blessed.” 
“Whoever curses you will be cursed {by God}, and/but whoever blesses you will be blessed {by him}.” or “Whoever curses you {God }will curse, but whoever blesses you {he} will bless.” or “I ask {God} to curse those who curse you, and/but I ask {him} to bless those who bless you.” See how you translated “curse” in Gen 12:3.


27:30-40 Esau Gets “Blessed” Too By Isaac

Gen 27:30 Then it happened, just as Isaac finished blessing Jacob, and it happened, scarcely had Jacob just left from the presence of Isaac his father, then Esau his brother came in from his hunt. 

Then it happened, just as Isaac finished blessing Jacob, 
“Just as Isaac finished blessing Jacob,” or “As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob,”

and it happened, scarcely had Jacob just left from the presence of Isaac his father, then
“and right after Jacob had left his father’s presence/tent,” or “and no sooner had Jacob left his father than”

Esau his brother 
“his/Jacob’s brother Esau” 

came in from his hunt.  
“came back from hunting.” or “returned {home} from hunting.”


Gen 27:31 Then he too prepared tasty food, and he brought {it} to his father and said to his father, “Let my father get up and eat from his son’s game, so that your soul can bless me.” 

Then he too prepared tasty food, 
“Then he/Esau also prepared/cooked a tasty/delicious meal {with/from the meat he had hunted},” Consider again how you translated “prepared tasty food” in verses 4, 7, 9, 14, 31 and “tasty” in verse 17.

and he brought {it} to his father 
“and he took/carried {it} to his father {Isaac}”

and said to his father,
“and said to him,” or “and requested,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Let my father get up 
“Father, {please} sit up”. Esau’s request to his father should sound polite in your translation, not rude or demanding. (See: writing-politeness)

and eat from his son’s game, 
“and eat some of your son’s {wild} animal/deer meat” or “and eat some of my {wild} animal/deer meat,” Make sure it is clear in your translation that Esau is referring to himself in this phrase. (See: figs-123person)

so that your soul can bless me.”
“so that you can bless me.” or “and then you can bless me.” See how you translated a similar phrase in verses 4, 19, 25 and 31.


Gen 27:32 But Isaac his father said to him, “Who {are} you?” And he said, “I {am} your son, your firstborn Esau.”

But Isaac his father said to him,
“But/Then his father asked him,” or “But his father responded/asked,” For some languages it is more natural to make “Isaac” explicit in verse 31 and leave it implied here in verse 32. Do what is best in your language.

“Who {are} you?”
“Which son {are} you?!” or “Which of my sons {are} you?!” Isaac knew from what Esau just said in verse 31 that one of his sons was talking to him. Also, Isaac is very upset, so some translations add an exclamation mark after the question mark to help communicate that. Do what is best in your language.
   
And he said, 
“Esau answered {him},” or “Esau replied,” (See: writing-quotations)

“I {am} your son, your firstborn Esau.” 
“I {am} your firstborn/oldest son Esau.” or “I {am} Esau, your firstborn/oldest son.” See how you translated “firstborn” in verse 19.


Gen 27:33 Then Isaac trembled a very great tremble and he said, “Then who {was} it that hunted game and brought {it} to me? And I ate from {it} all just before you came, and I blessed him. Indeed he will be blessed.”

Then Isaac trembled a very great tremble 
“Then Isaac {became so upset that he} trembled/shook very violently/noticeably” or “Then Isaac {was very upset, so that he} began to tremble/shake all over”

and he said,
“and he asked {Esau},” (See: writing-quotations)

“Then who {was} it 
“Who {was} it then” or “Then where {is} the one”

that hunted game and brought {it} to me?
“that/who hunted game/deer meat and brought a meal to me?” or “that/who brought to me a meal made from wild animal/deer meat?” Consider again how you translated “game” in Gen 27:3, 5, 7, 19, 25, 31 and 33. It may be necessary to translate it slightly differently, depending on the context.

And I ate from {it} all just before you came, 
“Just before you came {to me}, I finished eating the meal” or “I finished eating it just before you came {here}”

and I blessed him. Indeed he will be blessed.”
“and then I blessed him. And/So God will definitely bless him.” or “Then I asked God to bless him, and/so God will definitely bless him.” Consider where it is most natural in your language to begin a new sentence here. (See: figs-activepassive) 


Gen 27:34 When Esau heard the words of his father, then he cried out a great and exceedingly bitter cry and said to his father, “Bless me, me too, my father!” 

When Esau heard the words of his father, 
“When Esau heard what his father said {to him{,”

then he cried out a great and exceedingly bitter cry
“he shouted/burst out with an extremely/very loud and bitter/distressed cry/shout” or “he was so distressed/upset that he cried/yelled out loudly/bitterly”

and said to his father, 
“and begged his father,” or “and begged him,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Bless me, me too, my father!”
“{Please} bless me too, father!” or “Father, {please} bless me too!” For some languages it is more natural to put the address “My father” or “Father” first in this sentence. Do what is best in your language.


Gen 27:35 And he said, “Your brother came in deceit and took your blessing.” 

And he said, 
“But his father responded/replied {to him},” (See: writing-quotations)

“Your brother came in deceit and took your blessing.”  
“Your brother came {to me} and deceived/tricked {me} and stole the blessing that I was planning to give you.” or “Your brother deceived/tricked me so that I blessed him instead of you!”


Gen 27:36 Then he said, “Is it because his name is called Jacob that he has defrauded me these two times? He took my birthright, and behold now he has taken my blessing!” Then he said, “Have you not reserved a blessing for me?”

Then he said, 
“Then Esau exclaimed {bitterly/angrily},” or “{When Esau heard that,} he said/exclaimed {bitterly/angrily},”

“Is it because his name is called Jacob that he has defrauded me these two times? 
“It is no wonder that he is called Jacob, since he has cheated me two times!” or “The name Jacob fits him exactly, because he has tricked me like this two times {now}!” Esau uses a rhetorical question here to show his strong emotion. Do what is most natural in your language. (See: figs-rquestion)

Jacob
In order to help readers understand why Esau said this about Jacob, some translations include a footnote like the following: The name “Jacob” means “heel-grabber” and can imply deception. He was given that name because when he was born, he was grabbing hold of Esau’s heel (Genesis 25:26).

He took my birthright, and 
“{First} he stole my rights as the oldest son, and” or “Not only did he take/steal my birthright, but”

behold now 
“now look/see {what he has done}:” 

he has taken my blessing!”
“he has {also} stolen my blessing!” or “he has tricked/deceived you into blessing him instead of me!”

Then he said, 
“Then he/Esau begged {his father},” or “Then he/Esau pleaded {with his father},”

“Don’t you still have at least one blessing left for me?” or “Is there still a/some way you can {ask God to} bless me?”
 

Gen 27:37 But Isaac responded and said to Esau, “Behold, I have made him master over you, and I have given all his brothers to him as servants. And I have sustained him with grain and wine. So then, what can I do for you, my son?” 

But Isaac responded and said to Esau, 
“Isaac responded/replied to Esau/him,” or “Isaac answered him,”

“Behold, I have made him master over you, 
“Look/Listen, I have {already} appointed Jacob to be your master”. See how you translated “master” in verse 29.

and I have given all his brothers to him as servants. 
“In fact, I said that you and all your descendants will serve him.” or “In fact, I have asked {God to make it so} that you and your descendants will serve him {and his descendants}.” See how you translated “brothers” in verse 29.

And I have sustained him 
“Besides that, I have {also} supplied/blessed him” or “I have {also} asked God to provide/supply/bless him”

with grain and wine. 
“with {abundant} harvests/food and wine/drink.” or “with {plenty of} food and wine/drink.” See how you translated “grain and wine” in verse 28. (See: figs-metonymy)

So then, what can I do for you, my son?”  
“So then, there is no way left for me to bless you, my son!” or “So my son, there is no blessing left for you!” Isaac uses this rhetorical question to emphasize that there is no blessing left for Esau. (See: figs-rquestion)


Gen 27:38 But Esau said to his father, “Is there one blessing that you have, my father? Bless me, me too, my father!” Then Esau lifted his voice and sobbed. 

But Esau said to his father, 
“But Esau continued to beg his father {and said},” or “But again Esau begged/pleaded/asked,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Is there one blessing that you have, my father?
“Father, isn’t there {just/even} one way that you can bless {me}?” or “Father, don’t you have at least one blessing left to give me?” It may be more natural to put “my father” or “Father” first in this quote. See what you did in verse 34.

Bless me, me too, my father!” 
“{Please} bless me too, father!” or “Father, {please} bless me too!” See how you translated this sentence in verse 34.

Then Esau lifted his voice and sobbed.  
“Then/And Esau started sobbing/crying loudly.” See how you translated “lifted...voice and sobbed” in Gen 21:16. (See: figs-idiom)


Gen 27:39 Then Isaac his father responded and said to him, “Behold, your dwelling will be away from the fatness of the earth and away from the dew of the heavens from above.

Then Isaac his father responded and said to him,
“Finally/So his father Isaac responded/said to him,” or “His father replied,” (See: writing-quotations]

“Behold, your dwelling will be
“Listen, you {and your descendants} will live”. What Isaac says in verses 39-40 applies to Esau and his descendants. See what you did for a similar case in verses 28-29. (See: figs-metonymy)

away from the fatness of the earth and away from the dew of the heavens from above. 
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean (1) “away from the fatness of the earth and away from the dew of the heavens from above.” or “in a place/region where the earth/land/ground is not rich/fertile and where there is very little dew/rain.” or “in a place/region where the land/soil is not good {for farming} and where there is not much rain.” (2) “of the fatness of the earth and of the dew of the heavens from above.” or “in a place where the land is good/fertile {for farming} and where there is {plenty of} dew/rain.” See how you translated “fatness of the earth” and “dew of the heavens” in verse 28.


Gen 27:40 And you will live by your sword, and you will serve your brother. But it will happen when you become restless, then you will break his yoke off of your neck.” 

And you will live by your sword, 
“You {and your descendants} will survive by using your swords {to protect yourselves},” or “You {and your descendants} will have to fight battles to stay alive,” or “You {and your descendants} will continually be fighting battles {with other peoples/nations},” The phrase “live by your sword” is an idiom that means Esau and his descendants will have violent conflict with others, often in order to survive. (See: figs-idiom)

and you will serve your brother. 
“and you {and your descendants} will serve your brother {and his descendants}.” or “and you {and your descendants} will be servants/slaves for your brother {and his descendants}.” 

But it will happen when you become restless,
“But when you rebel/revolt {against him/them},” Consider again how you translated the singular “you” in verses 39-40. You could use a plural “you” here or you could say “you {and your descendants}. See what you did for a similar case in verses 28-29. (See: figs-metonymy)

then you will break his yoke off of your neck.”
“you will break/get free from his/their control/rule over you.” or “you will no longer be under his/their control/rule.” The metaphor “break his yoke off of your neck” means Esau and his descendants will be free from the control of Jacob and his descendants. A yoke is a wooden collar that is placed around the necks of work animals to control them as they pull a plow or cart. (See: figs-metaphor)


27:41-28:5 Jacob Flees From Esau

Gen 27:41 Then Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing that his father had blessed him with, and Esau said in his heart, “The days of the mourning of my father are near, then I will kill Jacob my brother.” 

Then Esau hated Jacob 
“After that, Esau held a grudge against Jacob” or “Esau continued to be very angry with/at Jacob”

because of the blessing that his father had blessed him with, 
“because his/their father had given his blessing to Jacob.” or “because their father had blessed Jacob {instead of him}.” Consider again how you translated the terms “bless” and “blessing” in chapter 27. See verses 4, 7, 10, 19, 23, 25, 27, 29-31, 33-36, 38 and 41. (See: translate-key-terms)

and Esau said in his heart, 
“So Esau said/thought to himself,” (See: writing-quotations)

“The days of the mourning of my father are near, then 
“Soon my father will die and we will have a time of mourning for him, but after that” or “Soon my father will die; then after we {bury him and} mourn for him,” In that culture, they had the custom of mourning the death of a loved one for a certain period of time, anywhere from a week to a month or more. See how you translated “mourn” in Gen 23:2.

I will kill
“I am going to kill” or “I plan to kill”

Jacob my brother.”
“my brother Jacob.” or “Jacob.”


Gen 27:42 But the words of Esau her older son were told to Rebekah, so she sent and called for Jacob her younger son and said to him, “Behold, Esau your brother is consoling himself about you, planning to kill you. 

But the words of Esau her older son were told to Rebekah, so 
“But/Then someone told Rebekah what Esau was saying/planning, so” or “But/Then Rebekah heard about what her older/oldest son Esau was planning, so” or “When Rebekah heard what Esau was planning {to do},” It was probably a servant who told Rebekah about Esau’s plan to kill Jacob. (See: figs-activepassive)

she sent and called for Jacob her younger son 
“she sent for her younger/youngest son Jacob {to come to her}” or “she sent a messenger to tell Jacob {to come to her}” or “she summoned her son Jacob”

and said to him, 
“and told/warned him,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Behold, Esau your brother is consoling himself about you, planning to kill you. 
“Look/Listen, your brother Esau is making himself feel better by planning to kill you.” or “Listen, your brother Esau is planning to take revenge on you and kill you.”


Gen 27:43 So now, my son, listen to my voice and get up, flee for yourself to Laban my brother in Haran! 

So now, my son, 
“So then, my son,” or “Now son,” See how you translated “So now” in verses 3 and 8.

listen to my voice
“listen to me:” or “obey what I tell you:” See how you translated this phrase in verses 8 and 13. It may be necessary to translate it differently here because of the context. (See: figs-metonymy)

and get up, flee for yourself 
“get ready immediately and flee/escape” or “Hurry {and} flee/escape” or “Flee/Escape immediately”

to Laban my brother in Haran!  
“to my brother Laban {who lives} in {the city of} Haran!” or “to {the city of} Haran, to {the house of} my brother Laban!” For some languages, it is more natural to put the location (Haran) before the person who lives there (Laban). Do what is best in your language.


Gen 27:44 And stay with him for a few days until the fury of your brother turns away, 

And stay with him for a few days
“Stay/Live with him for a short time”

until the fury of your brother turns away, 
“until your brother’s fury/anger subsides/stops” or “until your brother is no longer furious/angry {with you}”. Consider whether it is more natural in your language to end this sentence here or to continue the sentence into verse 45. Also, the phrase “turns away” is used here as an idiom that means “becomes less” or “goes away”. (See: figs-idiom)


Gen 27:45 until the anger of your brother turns away from you and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send and get you from there. Why should I also lose both of you {in} one day?”

until the anger of your brother turns away from you
“until his anger against you is gone” or “When he is not angry with you anymore” or “After a while, when your brother is no longer angry with you”. The Hebrew word for “anger” here is different from the stronger word (“fury”) in verse 44. (See: figs-idiom)

and he forgets what you have done to him. 
“and he forgets what you did to him” or “and he no longer thinks about what you did” or “and he doesn’t hold a grudge against you anymore”. Rebekah is not saying that Esau would totally forget what Jacob did, but that at some point he would not hold it against him anymore.

Then I will send and get you from there. 
“I will send word that it is safe for you to come {back home} from there.” or “I will send someone to tell you when/that it is safe to come back {home}.” 

Why should I also lose both of you {in} one day?”
“I do not want to lose both of you {on} the same day!” or “I do not want both my sons to be killed!” Rebekah knew that if Esau were to kill Jacob, he himself would have been killed for that crime. Consider whether it is best in your language to use a rhetorical question or an exclamation to emphasize Rebekah’s concern. (See: figs-rquestion)


Gen 27:46 Then Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am disgusted with my life because of the daughters of Heth! If Jacob takes a wife from the daughters of Heth like these, from daughters of the land, what {would} life {be} to me?”

Then Rebekah said to Isaac, 
“Then Rebekah complained to Isaac,” or “{Soon} after that, Rebekah said/complained to Isaac,” (See: writing-quotations)

“I am disgusted with my life
“My life is {very} miserable” or “I do not enjoy living” or “I am very upset”. Rebekah is exaggerating how she feels to influence Isaac to do what she wants. (See: figs-hyperbole)

because of the daughters of Heth! 
“because of the Hittite women {whom Esau married}!” or “because of our Hittite daughters-in-law {whom Esau married}!” To show that Rebekah is speaking with strong emotion, you could use an exclamation point at the end of this sentence and the following one.

If Jacob takes a wife from the daughters of Heth like these, from daughters of the land,
“If Jacob {also} marries a Hittite woman from around here,” or “If Jacob were to {also} marry a local Hittite woman like that,”

what {would} life {be} to me?”
“my life will/would not be worth living!” or “I would not want to keep on living!” Rebekah uses a rhetorical question and hyperbole to emphasize how upset she would be if Jacob married a Hittite woman. (See: figs-rquestion)


28

Gen 28:1 Then Isaac called for Jacob and blessed him, and commanded him and said to him, “Do not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan. 

Then Isaac 
“So Isaac” or “{Because of what Rebekah said,} Isaac” (See: grammar-connect-logic-result)

called for Jacob 
“called/sent for Jacob {to come to him}” or “summoned Jacob” (See: writing-quotations)

and blessed him,
“blessed him,” or “{When/After Jacob/he came,} Isaac blessed him”. For some languages it may be necessary to make it explicit that Jacob arrived. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-explicit)

and commanded him and said to him,
“and told/instructed him,” or “and said to him,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Do not
“You must not“

take a wife from the daughters of Canaan. 
“take/marry a woman who is a descendant of Canaan.” or “take/choose a wife from among the Canaanite women.” or “marry a Canaanite woman.” If the word “woman” is used here in your translation, make sure it refers to a virgin woman who has never been married, or is general enough to include that.


Gen 28:2 Get up, go to Paddan Aram, to the home of Bethuel the father of your mother, and take a wife for yourself from there, from the daughters of Laban the brother of your mother. 

Get up, go 
“{Rather} get up/ready and go” or “{Instead} you must go right away”. See how you translated “get up” in Gen 27:43. (See: grammar-connect-logic-contrast)

to Paddan Aram, 
“to {the land/region of} Paddan Aram,” Be consistent here with how you translated “Paddan Aram” in Gen 25:20. (See: translate-names)

to the home of Bethuel the father of your mother, 
“to the home/family of your mother’s father Bethuel,” or “to your grandfather Bethuel’s home/family,”

and take a wife for yourself from there, from
“and choose/find a woman from there to marry from among” or “and marry one of”

the daughters of Laban the brother of your mother.
“the daughters of your mother’s brother Laban.” or “your uncle Laban’s daughters.” Laban was Rebekah’s older brother. Some languages have a special term for this that is used here. (See: translate-kinship)


Gen 28:3 And may God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you so that you become a community of peoples. 

And may God Almighty bless you 
“I pray that Almighty God will bless/prosper you” or “I ask God, {who is} all-powerful, to bless/prosper you” or “I pray that God, {who is} all-powerful, will bless/prosper you”. Most translation teams translate the meaning of God’s title here (for example, “God Almighty”). Other teams transliterate the title as “El Shaddai” (as if it were a name) and put the meaning of the title in a footnote. See how you handled “God Almighty” in Gen 17:1.

and make you fruitful 
“and give you many children” or “and enable you to have many children” 

and multiply you
and increase {the number of} your descendants” or “so that you have many descendants and”. See how you translated “fruitful and multiply” in Gen 17:20. It may need to be translated differently depending on the context.

so that you become a community of peoples. 
“so that you become {the ancestor of} many people groups.” or “so that many people groups will descend/come from you.” or “so that they become many people groups.”


Gen 28:4 And may he give the blessing of Abraham to you, to you and to your offspring with you, so that you possess the land of your sojournings, which God gave to Abraham.” 

And may he 
“I {also} pray that he/God will” or “I {also} ask him/God to”

give the blessing of Abraham to you, to you and to your offspring with you,
“give Abraham’s blessing to you and your descendants,” or “bless you and your descendants the same way that he blessed Abraham,”

so that you possess the land
“so that you will own the/this land” or “so that you will take possession of the/this land” 

of your sojournings,
“where you have been living/residing as a foreigner/outsider,” or “where you {and your ancestors} have been living as foreigners/outsiders,” See how you translated “land of your sojournings” in Gen 17:8; it may be necessary to translate this differently here because of the different context.

which God gave to Abraham.” 
“{the same land} which God gave/promised to Abraham/him.”


Gen 28:5 Then Isaac sent Jacob, and he went to Paddan Aram, to Laban, the son of Bethuel the Aramean and the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.

Then Isaac sent Jacob, 
“Then Isaac sent Jacob {on his way},” or “Then Isaac said good-bye to Jacob,”

and he went 
“and he/Jacob left to go/travel” or “and/so Jacob started traveling”. Make sure your translation of this phrase does not sound like Jacob had already arrived at Paddan Aram.

to Paddan Aram, to Laban
“to/toward {the land/region of} Paddan Aram, to Laban” or “to/toward {his uncle} Laban{‘s house} {which was} in {the land/region of} Paddan Aram.” Consider whether is more natural in your language to refer to Paddan Aram first or to Laban first in this sentence. Also see how you translated “to Paddan Aram” in verses 2 and 5. (See: figs-infostructure)

the son of Bethuel the Aramean
“{who/Laban was} the son of Bethuel the Aramean”. Be consistent with how you spelled the name “Bethuel” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 22:22-23; 24:15, 24, 47, 50; 25:20; 28:2, 5.

and the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.
“and {also} the brother of Rebekah, {who was} Jacob and Esau’s mother.”
 

28:6-9 Esau Takes Another Wife
 
Gen 28:6 Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and had sent him to Paddan Aram to take a wife for himself from there, {and that} when he blessed him, then he commanded him, saying, “Do not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan.”

Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and had sent him to Paddan Aram
“Now Esau had seen/observed Isaac bless Jacob and send him to {the land/region of} Paddan Aram”

to take a wife for himself from there, 
“to choose/marry a wife from {among his relatives} there” or “to marry a woman from there”

{and that} when he blessed him, then he commanded him, saying,
“{and that} when/as Isaac was blessing him/Jacob, he told/instructed him/Jacob,” or “When/As Isaac was blessing him/Jacob, {Esau heard} him tell/instruct him/Jacob,” Consider whether or not it is more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here. Also see how you translated “commanded” in verse 1.

“Do not 
“You must not” 

take a wife from the daughters of Canaan.”
“take/marry a woman who is a descendant of Canaan,” or “take/choose a wife from among the Canaanite women,” or “marry a Canaanite woman,” See how you translated this sentence in verse 1.


Gen 28:7 and {that} Jacob listened to his father and to his mother and went to Paddan Aram. 

and {that} Jacob 
“and {also} {saw/observed that} Jacob” or “{Esau also saw/noticed that} Jacob”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

listened to his father and to his mother 
“obeyed his/their father and mother” or “obeyed his/their parents”

and went to Paddan Aram.
“and {immediately} left to go to Paddan Aram.” or “and started traveling to Paddan Aram.”


Gen 28:8 Then Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan were displeasing in the eyes of Isaac his father.

Then Esau saw that
“That is when/how Esau realized/understood that”

the daughters of Canaan were displeasing in the eyes of Isaac his father.
“his father Isaac did not approve of {his sons marrying} Canaanite women.” or “his father Isaac did not want {his sons to marry} Canaanite women.”


Gen 28:9 So Esau went to Ishmael and he took as a wife Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebaioth, in addition to his wives {who belonged} to him.

So Esau went to Ishmael 
“So/Then Esau went/traveled to {the family/clan of} Ishmael” or “So/Then Esau went to {the region where} Ishmael’s descendants were living”. Most likely Ishmael was already dead by this time, so that Esau went to the region where Ishmael’s children and other descendants were living.

and he took as a wife Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael Abraham’s son, 
“and married Abraham’s granddaughter Mahalath, who was Ishmael’s daughter” or “and married Mahalath, who was the daughter of Abraham’s son Ishmael”. It may be more natural to move “Abraham’s son” earlier in this sentence and say, “So/Then Esau went to {the family of} Abraham’s son Ishmael and married Ishmael’s daughter Mahalath, whose brother was Nebaioth.” (See: figs-infostructure)

the sister of Nebaioth, 
“and {who was} the {younger} sister of Nebaioth,” or “and whose {older} brother was Nebaioth,” Be consistent here with how you spelled “Nebaioth” in Gen 25:13. Since Nebaioth was Ishmael’s oldest child, Mahalath was his younger sister, probably from the same mother. Use a kinship term here in your language for “sister” or “brother” that fits with those facts. (See: translate-kinship)
 
in addition to his wives {who belonged} to him.
“besides the {two} wives he already had.” Consider whether it is better in your language to put this phrase earlier in this sentence and say, “So, in addition to the {two} wives he already had, Esau...” (See: figs-infostructure)

 
28:10-22 Jacob’s Dream At Bethel

Gen 28:10 And Jacob left from Beersheba and set out for Haran.

And Jacob left from Beersheba and set out for 
“{After} Jacob left from {his family’s home in} {the city of} Beersheba, he started traveling to/toward” or “{Meanwhile} Jacob had left {the city of} Beersheba and was traveling to/toward”. Verse 10 refers back to verse 5, where Jacob had left his parents’ home in Beersheba to go to Paddan Aram. Make sure your translation does not sound like he left a second time here in verse 10. (See: figs-explicit)

Haran.
“{the city of} Haran {in the region/land of Paddan Aram}.” Make sure it is clear in your translation that Jacob was heading toward the same place that his father had told him to go to in verse 2. The author assumed here that his audience knew that Haran was a city located in the Paddan Aram region. It may be helpful to include a map in your translation that shows the locations of the city of Haran and the region of Paddan Aram. (See: figs-explicit)


Gen 28:11 Then he reached a {certain} place, and he stopped there because the sun had gone. And he took {one} of the stones of the place and put it under his head, and he lay down in that place.

Then he reached a {certain} place, and he stopped there 
“{That evening} he reached a {good} place {to camp/sleep}, so he stayed/spent the night there” or “{Late that evening} he came to a place where he stopped/stayed {for the night}”

because the sun had gone. 
“because the sun had gone {down}.” or “because the sun had set.” For some languages it is more natural to put the information in this clause first in this sentence and say, “After the sun went down, he reached a good place {to camp/sleep}, so he stopped/stayed there {for the night}.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

And he took {one} of the stones of the place 
“He chose {one} of the stones that was there” or “He picked out a large {flat} stone {that he found} there”. The way you translate “stone” should refer to something that would be large enough to support Jacob’s head, but not so large that it would be too heavy for him to lift. For example in English, a pebble is too small and a boulder is too big.

and put it under his head, 
“and rested his head on it {as a headrest/pillow}” or “and used it as a headrest/pillow” or “to use as a headrest/pillow”

and he lay down in that place. 
“then he lay down there {and went to sleep}.” or “Then he lay down there {on the ground} {and went to sleep}.” or “then he went to sleep there.”


Gen 28:12 And he dreamed, and behold, a stairway was set up on the earth and its top reached to the heavens, and behold, angels of God were ascending and descending on it.

And he dreamed, and
“And {as} he dreamed,” or “{As/While he slept,} he had a dream and” or “While he was dreaming,”

behold, a stairway was set up on the earth 
“he saw a stairway/staircase whose base was resting on the ground” or “he saw a stairway/staircase. The bottom/base of the stairway was/rested on the ground”. This stairway was wide enough for there to be angels moving up and down on it at the same time. (See: translate-unknowns)

and its top reached to the heavens,
“and its top reached up to heaven,” or “and the top of it went/reached {all the way} up into the heavens/sky,”

and behold, angels of God were 
“and there were angels of/from God who were” or “and he saw God’s angels”. See how you translated “angel” in Gen 24:7, 40. (See: translate-key-terms)

ascending and descending on it.
“going up and coming down on the stairway.” or “going up and down on the stairway.”


Gen 28:13 And behold, Yahweh was standing above it, and he said, “I {am} Yahweh, the God of Abraham your grandfather and the God of Isaac. The land that you are lying on I will give to you and to your offspring. 

And behold, Yahweh was standing above it,
“Then suddenly Yahweh was standing at the top {of the stairway},” or “And there standing at the top {of the stairway} was Yahweh,” or “And Yahweh was {also} there, standing at the top {of the stairway}”. The phrase for “above it” in the Hebrew text is ambiguous. It could mean: 1) “above it” or “at the top {of the stairway}”; or 2) “above/beside him/Jacob”. The interpretation that is not followed in your translation could be put in a footnote.

and he said, “I {am} Yahweh, 
“and he/Yahweh said {to him/Jacob}, “I {am} Yahweh,” (See: writing-quotations)

the God of Abraham your grandfather and the God of Isaac. 
“the God whom your forefathers/ancestors Abraham and Isaac serve/worship.” or “the God {who takes care} of your forefathers/ancestors Abraham and Isaac.” Abraham was Jacob’s grandfather and ancestor.

The land that you are lying on I will give to you and to your offspring.
“The/This land where you are lying/sleeping I am giving to you and your descendants.” or “I will give you and your descendants this land that you are lying/sleeping on.” In the Hebrew text, “the land that you are lying on” comes first in this sentence in order to emphasize it and show its importance. Do what is natural in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 28:14 And your offspring will be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south. And in you and in your offspring all the families of the earth will be blessed.

And your offspring will be 
“And your descendants will be” or “They will be” or “You will have so many descendants that they will be”

like the dust of the earth,
“{as numerous/many} as the dust {specks} on the ground,” See how you translated “dust” in Gen 13:16. (See: figs-simile)

and you will spread out 
“and your descendants/people will spread out” or “so that they expand {their territory}” or “so that they live throughout this land”. In this clause “you” refers to Jacob’s descendants. Make sure that is clear in your translation. (See: figs-metonymy)

to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south. 
“to the west, east, north and south.” or “to the north, south, east and west.” or “in every direction.” See how you translated the names of the directions “west”, “east”, “north” and “south” in Gen 13:14. Notice that they are in a different order there.

And in you and in your offspring
“In/Through you and your offspring/descendants” or “Because of you and your offspring/descendants” or “By means of you and your offspring/descendants”. Be consistent here with how you translated “your offspring” in Gen 22:18 and 26:4.

all the families of the earth will be blessed.
“all the families/people on the earth will be blessed {by me}.” or “{I} will bless all the families/clans/people in the world.” For some languages it may be better to change the order of phrases in this sentence and say, “And {I} will bless all the families in the world through you and your offspring/descendants.” or “I will use you and your offspring/descendants to bless all the families on earth.” See how you translated similar Messianic blessings in Gen 12:3, 18:18, 22:18, and 26:4. (See: figs-activepassive)


Gen 28:15 And behold, I {am} with you, and I will watch over you in every {place} that you go, and I will bring you back to this land. For I will not leave you until I have done what I have spoken to you.” 

And behold, 
“Listen to this:” or “Remember that” 

I {am} with you,
“I {will always be/stay} with you.” or “I {promise to always be/stay} with you {and help you}.” See how you translated “I {am} with you” in Gen 26:24 and “I will be with you” in Gen 26:3.

and I will watch over you 
“I will protect/guard you” or “I will take care of you”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

in every {place} that you go,
“everywhere that you go/live,” or “wherever you go/live,”

and I will bring you back to this land. 
“and I will lead/guide you back to this land.”

For I will not leave you 
“In fact, I will never leave/abandon you”

until I have done what I have spoken to you.”
“and I will do everything that I have promised you {that I will do}.” Make sure your translation of “until” does not sound like God will only be with Jacob up to the time that he fulfills his promises. Rather the focus is on the period of time between now when God is speaking to Jacob and the time later on when Jacob would see the fulfillment of God’s promises to him.


Gen 28:16 Then Jacob woke up from his sleep and said, “Surely Yahweh is in this place, but I did not know {it}!” 

Then Jacob woke up from his sleep and said,
“Suddenly Jacob woke up from his dream and said/exclaimed {to himself},” or “When Jacob woke up from his dream, he said/exclaimed {to himself},”

“Surely Yahweh is in this place,
“Certainly Yahweh is/lives {here} in this place,” or “Yahweh definitely lives here,”

but I did not know {it}!”
“but I did not know/realize {it} {before now}!” or “but I was not aware of {that} {before}!”


Gen 28:17 So he was afraid and said, “How awesome this place is! This is nothing other than the house of God, and this {is} the gateway of heaven!”

So he was afraid and said,
“He was afraid, so he {also} said/exclaimed,”

“How awesome this place is! 
“This is an awesome/terrifying place!” or “This place is terrifying!” The word “awesome” refers here to the terror that Jacob was feeling from being in the holy presence of Almighty God.

This is nothing other than the house of God, 
“This/It can only be God’s house!” or “This/It must be the house/place where God himself lives!” 

and this {is} 
“This/It {can only be}” or “This/It {must be}”. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin a new sentence here.

the gateway of heaven!”
“the gateway/entrance to heaven!”

_____________________Paragraph Break_____________________

Gen 28:18 Then in the morning Jacob got up early, and he took the stone that he had put under his head and stood it up {as} a pillar, and he poured oil on its top.

Then in the morning Jacob got up early, 
“Early the next morning Jacob got up,” or “Jacob got up early the next morning,”

and he took the stone that he had put under his head 
“took the stone that he had used as a headrest/pillow”. See how you translated “stone” and “under his head” in verse 11.

and stood it up 
“and stood/set it up {on its end}”

{as} a pillar,
“{as} a monument” or “{as} a memorial stone” or “to commemorate/mark the/that place {where God had appeared to him}”. The word “pillar” refers here to a stone that is used to commemorate something. In this case, Jacob used a stone to mark and help him remember the place where God had appeared to him.

and he poured oil on its top.
“Then he poured {some} {olive} oil on top of the stone/pillar {to dedicate the place to God}.” In Bible times people poured olive oil on a person’s head or on objects (as here) to dedicate that person or object to God. Make sure that the way you translate “oil” does not refer to motor oil. (See: translate-symaction)


Gen 28:19 And he called the name of that place Bethel, even though Luz {had been} the name of the town at first.

And he called the name of that place Bethel, 
“He named that place Bethel, {which means “God’s house,”}” Be consistent here with how you spelled “Bethel” in Gen 12:8 and 13:3.

even though Luz {had been} the name of the town at first.
“even though originally/previously that town was named/called Luz.” or “Originally/Previously the name of that town {had been} Luz.” Consider whether or not it is more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here.

_____________________Paragraph Break_____________________

Gen 28:20 Then Jacob vowed a vow, saying, “If God will be with me and watch over me on this road that I am walking on and he gives to me bread to eat and clothes to wear,

Then Jacob vowed a vow, saying,
“Then Jacob/he made a vow/pledge/promise {to God} and said,” See how you translated a clause that has a similar meaning (“swear to...”) in Gen 21:23, 31. 

“If God will be with me 
“God, if {you,} will be/stay with me”. Since Jacob is making this vow to God, for some languages it is more natural to address God directly (as “you”) throughout verses 20-22, rather than only in the last half of verse 22 (as the Hebrew text does). Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-123person)

and watch over me 
“and protect/guard me” or “and take care of me”. See how you translated “watch over” in verse 15.

on this road that I am walking on
“on/during this {long} journey I am taking” or “as I travel on this {long} journey”. The way you translate this phrase should reflect that fact that Jacob’s journey from his home to the city of Haran was about 725 kilometers (450 miles) long. 

and he gives to me bread to eat and clothes to wear,
“and if you give/provide me food to eat and clothes to wear,” or “and if you provide me with food and clothes”. In this context “bread” refers to food in general, not just bread. (See: figs-metonymy)


Gen 28:21 and I return in peace to the home of my father, then Yahweh will be God to me, 

and I return in peace 
“and {if} I come back safely” or “so that I return safely”

to the home of my father, 
“to my father’s/family’s home,” or “to my family,”

then Yahweh will be God to me,
“then Yahweh, {you} will be the God whom I serve/worship,” or “then I will serve/worship {you} Yahweh as my God,” (See: figs-123person)


Gen 28:22 and this stone that I have stood up {as} a pillar will be the house of God, and all that you give to me I will tithe a tenth to you.”

and this stone that I have stood up {as} a pillar will be the house of God,
“This stone that I have set up will be your house and will mark the/this place {where you appeared to me},” or “and this memorial stone that I set up will remind people that you live here,” See how you translated “as a pillar” in verse 18. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

and all that you give to me I will tithe a tenth to you.”
“and everything that you give to me, I will give a tenth of it back to you.” or “and I will give back to you ten percent of everything that you give to me.” Consider again how you translated the way Jacob refers to Yahweh in verses 20-22; see the note about this at verse 20. Also see how you translated “tithe” in Gen 14:20. (See: figs-123person)

29:1-14 Jacob Meets Rachel And Laban In The City Of Haran

Gen 29:1 Then Jacob lifted his feet and went to the land of the sons of the east. 

Then Jacob lifted his feet and went to
“Then Jacob left {Bethel} and continued traveling {until he came} to” or “Then Jacob continued traveling until he came to”

the land of the sons of the east. 
“the land in the east where various people/ethnic groups lived.” or “the land/region that was east {of the land of Canaan} where the eastern people/ethnic groups lived.” This land was located east of the land of Canaan and included the region of Paddan Aram where Jacob’s uncle Laban lived in the city of Haran (Gen 27:43; 28:5). See how you translated “east” in Gen 28:14.


Gen 29:2 And he looked and behold, a well {was} in the field, and behold, three flocks of sheep were lying there near it, because from that well the flocks were watered, and the stone over the mouth of the well {was} large. 

And he looked 
“Then he looked {around}” or “{When he arrived/got there,} he looked {around}” or “{When he arrived at a place near the city of Haran,} he looked {around}”. Jacob was now near the city of Haran (verse 4) which was in the land east of Canaan (verse 1). (See: figs-explicit)

and behold, a well {was} in the field, 
“and saw a well in an {open} field/area” or “and there in an {open} field/area {was} a well”. The word “field” refers to an open area of land, not a fenced-in area. See how you translated this term in Gen 25:27, 29.

and behold, three flocks of sheep were lying there
“He saw three flocks of sheep that were lying {down}” or “There were three flocks of sheep lying {down}”. Consider whether or not it is more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here.

near it, 
“near/beside the well {waiting for water}” (See: figs-explicit)

“because that was the well where the shepherds drew/got water for the sheep/flocks,” or “That was the well that flocks/sheep drank water from,” Consider whether or not it is more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here. 

and the stone over the mouth of the well {was} large.
“but the stone covering the opening/top of the well {was} large {and heavy}.” or “but there was a {heavy} large stone over/covering the opening/top of the well.” This stone would have been very large and heavy, and probably had been cut into a circular shape to cover the round opening of the well. You could include here in your translation a picture of a well with a round, flat stone covering it. (See: translate-unknown)


Gen 29:3 And all the flocks would be gathered there, then they would roll the stone from over the mouth of the well and water the sheep. Then they would return the stone to its place over the mouth of the well.

“{Every day} shepherds would bring all the/their flocks {of sheep} there. They would {work together to}” or “{Whenever/After} all the shepherds brought their flocks there, {together} they would”. Verse 3 tells what happened regularly every day. Consider the best way to communicate this in your language.

Gen 29:4 Then Jacob said to them, “My brothers, where {are} you from?” And they said, “We {are} from Haran.”

Then Jacob said to them, 
“Jacob asked/greeted the shepherds,” (See: writing-quotations)

“My brothers, 
“My friends,” or “Friends,” This is a polite, friendly idiom used as a greeting; it does not mean that the shepherds were actually Jacob’s relatives. Many languages have a similar greeting. (See; figs-idiom)

where {are} you from?”
“where do you live?”

And they said, 
“They replied {to him},” or “They answered {him},” (See: writing-quotations)

“We {are} from Haran.” 
“We {are} from {the city of} Haran.” or “We live in {the city of} Haran.” Your translation should not sound like the city of Haran was far away from there; it was nearby.


Gen 29:5 Then he said to them, “Do you know Laban the grandson of Nahor?” And they said, “We know him.” 

Then he said to them, 
“So Jacob asked them,” or “So Jacob asked,” Consider what is the most natural way in your language to translate quote margins in a conversation that goes back and forth quickly like the one in verses 4-8. After the conversation gets started, it often sounds more life-like and natural to shorten the quote margins and leave implied some of the references to the people who are being talked to (as long as it is still clear who is talking to whom). (See: figs-quotations)

“Do you know Laban the grandson of Nahor?”
“Do you know Laban, Nahor’s grandson?” or “Do you know Nahor’s grandson Laban?” Consider the best way to order this question in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

And they said, 
“They answered/replied,” (See: writing-quotations)

“We know him.”
“{Yes,} we know him.” or “{Yes,} we do.” Hebrew does not have a single word for “Yes”, but rather repeats words from what was asked. Do what is natural in your language.


Gen 29:6 Then he said to them, “Are {things} well for him?” And they said, “{Things are} well. And behold, Rachel his daughter is coming with the sheep.”

Then he said to them, 
“Then/So Jacob asked,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Are {things} well for him?”
“Are {things} going well for him?” or “Is he doing well?” Jacob is asking about Laban’s general well-being, not just his health.

And they said, 
“They answered {him},”

“{Things are} well. 
“{Yes,} {things are} well/good {for him}.” or “{Yes,} {he is} well.”

And behold, Rachel his daughter is coming with the sheep.” 
“Look, there/here is his/Laban’s daughter Rachel {now} with {his} sheep.” or “In fact, here comes his/Laban’s daughter Rachel {now}, bringing {his} sheep.”


Gen 29:7 Then he said, “Behold, the day {is} still large. {It is} not time for the livestock to be gathered. Water the sheep, and go pasture {them}.” 

Then he said, 
“Then Jacob said {to them},” or “Then Jacob urged {them},” (See: writing-quotations)

“Behold, the day {is} still large. 
“Look, it is still the middle of the day” or “Look, the sun is still high/bright {in the sky}” or “There is still a lot of daylight/sunlight left”. This is an idiom that means there are still many more hours of daytime left. Consider whether your language has an idiom for this. (See: figs-idiom)

{It is} not time for the livestock to be gathered.
“and/so {it is} too early/soon to gather the livestock/flocks {for the night}.”

Water the sheep, 
“{You ought to} draw/get water for them” or “{It seems like you should} water the/your sheep” or “So why not water the/your sheep”. For some languages it sounds too rude for Jacob to make a direct command here, so it is better to make this a suggestion, or even a rhetorical question. Do what is best in your language. (See: writing-politeness)

and go pasture {them}.” 
“and/then take {them} {back} out {to the fields} to graze {some more}.” or “then you can take them out to eat {more} grass.”
 

Gen 29:8 But they said, “We can’t until all the flocks are gathered and they roll the stone from over the mouth of the well. Then we will water the sheep.”

But they said,

Gen 29:11 Then Jacob kissed Rachel and lifted his voice and cried.

Then Jacob kissed Rachel 
“Then he kissed Rachel {on the/her cheek}” or “Then he greeted Rachel warmly/enthusiastically {as one of his relatives}”. In that culture it was common to greet a relative with a kiss on the cheek (or both cheeks). However, if it would be offensive in your culture for Jacob to kiss Rachel here, you could translate this more generally (see the second alternate translation above). Also see how you translated “kiss” in Gen 27:26-27.

and lifted his voice and cried. 
“and he started crying aloud/loudly {because he was so happy}.” or “and {he was so happy that} he started crying.” See how you translated the idiom “lifted his voice” in Gen 27:38. However, here Jacob is crying because he is happy, not upset. Make sure that is clear in your translation.


Gen 29:12 Then Jacob told Rachel that he {was} a relative of her father and that he {was} a son of Rebekah. Then she ran and told her father.

29:14b-30 Jacob Works For Laban To Marry Rachel And Leah

Then he stayed with him 
“Then Jacob stayed {and served/worked} with/for him/Laban” or “After Jacob had stayed with Laban {and worked for him}”. Your choice here in verse 14 will determine whether or not this sentence continues into verse 15. Do what is best in your language.

Gen 29:17 And the eyes of Leah {were} delicate, but Rachel was lovely of form and beautiful of appearance.

And the eyes of Leah {were} delicate, 
“Leah’s eyes {were} delicate/pretty/weak,” or “Leah had pretty eyes,” The Hebrew word for “delicate” is ambiguous in this context. It can have: 1) a positive meaning of “pretty” or “lovely”; or 2) a negative meaning of “weak”, which implies that Leah’s eyes were plain, dull or unattractive.

but Rachel was lovely of form and beautiful of appearance. 
“but/whereas Rachel’s face and figure/shape were lovely/beautiful.” or “but/whereas Rachel was extremely beautiful in every way.”

“had marital/sexual relations with her/Leah.” or “slept with her/Leah.” or “spent the night with her/Leah.” See how you translated the euphemism “went to” in Gen 16:4 (and “go to” in Gen 16:2 and 29:21). Translate this in a way that is natural, clear, and acceptable for reading in public. (See: figs-euphemism)


Gen 29:24 And Laban gave to her Zilpah his maidservant, to Leah his daughter, {to be} a maidservant.

And Laban gave 
“Laban also gave” or “In addition, Laban gave”. It is not clear in the Hebrew text when Laban gave Zilpah to Leah, so it is probably best to keep it that way in your translation. Some translations say that Laban “had {already} given” Zilpah to Leah before the wedding night. However according to Jewish history (outside the Bible), it was on the wedding night that Laban did this as part of his plan to deceive Jacob -- Zilpah was younger than Bilhah, so everyone would expect her to be given to Rachel as the younger sister; seeing Zilpah (instead of Bilhah) would help Jacob think that his veiled bride was Rachel. Since we do not know for sure which interpretation is right, it is probably best to be like the Hebrew text and not specify when Laban gave Zilpah to Leah. Some translations put this verse in parentheses because it seems to interrupt the telling of the main events.

“But the next morning” or “The next morning”

behold she {was} Leah! 
“{Jacob} saw/found that his {new} wife was Leah!” or “{Jacob was shocked to} see/discover that it was Leah {he had married}!” Translate “behold” in a way that shows Jacob’s surprise at finding out that he had married Leah instead of Rachel. Also, make sure that your translation of “she” refers here to Leah, not Zilpah (who was mentioned in verse 24). (See: writing-pronouns)

So he said to Laban,
“So/Then he/Jacob complained to {his father-in-law} Laban,” or “So/Then he/Jacob rebuked/confronted Laban and said,” Some languages use an honorific title such as “his father-in-law” here now that Jacob is married. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-honorifics)

“What {is} this you have done to me?
“Why have you treated me like this?” or “You have treated me very badly!” In this verse, Jacob uses rhetorical questions to communicate how angry and upset he is.

Gen 30:1 Now Rachel saw that she was not bearing {children} for Jacob, so Rachel envied her sister, and she said to Jacob, “Give me children, and if not, I will die!”

“Now/Meanwhile when Rachel saw/realized that she was not able to bear/have {any} {children} for Jacob,”

Rachel envied her sister, 
“she was envious/jealous of her sister {Leah},”

and she said to Jacob, 
“and she pleaded with Jacob,” or “and she demanded of Jacob,” Use a quote margin here in your language that fits the context well. (See: writing-quotations)

“Give me children, and if not,
“Help me have children, or else” or “Help me get pregnant! Otherwise”

I will die!”
“I want to die!” or “I have no reason to live!” Rachel is using hyperbole (exaggeration) to show how desperate and deeply ashamed she feels about not having children. You could include a footnote here in your translation that explains how in that culture it was considered very shameful for a woman to be barren (see Gen 30:23). (See: figs-hyperbole)

 
Gen 30:2 And Jacob’s anger burned against Rachel, and he said, “Am I in the place of God, who has kept the fruit of the womb from you?”

“I am not in the place of God, who has kept/prevented you from having children!” or “I am not God! He is the one who has kept/prevented you from having children!” Jacob uses a rhetorical question here to show that he is upset with Rachel and to strongly emphasize his point.

Gen 30:3 Then she said, “Behold my servant woman Bilhah. Go to her, so that she will bear {children} on my knees, and I also will be built up from her.”

“Behold my servant woman Bilhah. 
“Here is my servant Bilhah.” or “You can take/have my servant Bilhah {as a/another wife}.”

Go to her,

so that she will bear {children} 
“so that she will/can give birth {to children}” or “so that she will/can have children”

on my knees, 
“{for me} {who will sit} on my knees/lap” or “as my surrogate/substitute” or “for me”. The idiom “bear children on my knees” means that Bilhah’s children would be considered Rachel’s children. It may come from the custom of immediately putting a newborn child on the lap of the father and mother to symbolize that the child belonged to them. (See: figs-idiom)

and I also will be built up from her.”
“so that from/through her {children} I too can/will build/have a family.” or “so that I too can/will build/have a family.” See how you translated “built up from her” in Gen 16:2.

And she gave to him Bilhah her maidservant 
“So Rachel gave Jacob her servant/maid Bilhah”. See how you translated “maidservant” in Gen 29:24, 29. Also see how you translated a different word (“servant woman”) in verse 3 that has the same meaning. Some translations use the same term in both verses to prevent confusion. Do what is best in your language.

“Yes indeed, he has heard/answered my prayer/request/plea and given me a son!”

For that {reason} 
“That is why” or “Because of that”

she called his name 
“she called/named him” or “she gave him the name” or “she named her baby/son”. Make sure it is clear here in your translation that Rachel is naming Bilhah’s son, not God (who was the subject of the previous sentence). See how you translated “called his name” in Gen 29:32.

Gen 30:8 So Rachel said, “{With} mighty wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister. Indeed I have prevailed!” And she called his name Naphtali.

So Rachel said,
“So/Then Rachel exclaimed,”

“{With} mighty wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister.
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean (1) “I have had a mighty/difficult struggle/contest with my sister” or “I have struggled intensely/hard with/against my sister”. That would be the meaning if the Hebrew word “elohim” in this phrase is used as an adjective that means “mighty/powerful”. (2) “I have wrestled/struggled with God because of my sister”, which could refer to a struggle against her sister praying to God for children. That would be the meaning if the word “elohim” in this phrase means “God”.

Indeed I have prevailed!” 
“and I have won!” or “and/but now I have defeated her!” or “and/but now I am prevailing/winning!”

And she called his name 
“And/So she called/named him” or “Then/So she called/named that son” or “So she gave him the name”. See how you translated “called his name” in verse 6.

“I am truly/greatly blessed!” or “{God} has truly/greatly blessed me!” Although many translations have “happy” in this verse instead of “blessed”, the Hebrew noun (and the verb it is based on) is more general and has to do with a person’s blessed state (which results in joy and happiness). The same Hebrew word is used in Psalm 1:1, and the equivalent Greek word is used in Luke 1:48 and Matthew 5:3-11. 

For women will call me blessed.”

For {there was} little that was yours before me, and it has prospered to abundance, 
“Before I came, you had very little {wealth}, but now you are prospering abundantly/greatly.” or “The few {animals} that you owned before I came have multiplied/increased dramatically/greatly.” or “Before I worked for you, you owned very few animals, but now you have a huge/large number of animals.”

“That is how Yahweh has blessed/prospered you” or “Yes, Yahweh has blessed/prospered you”. See how you translated “blessed” in verse 27.

I will pass through all your flock{s} today 
“Let me go/look through all your flock{s} today” or “Today I will go/look through all your sheep and goats”

to remove from there
“and separate out from them” or “and take away from them”

every speckled and spotted lamb and every dark-colored lamb among the sheep, 
“all the lambs that are speckled, spotted or dark-colored,” or “all the lambs that have speckles or spots, or that are dark-colored,” The Hebrew word for “speckled” refers to small spots, whereas “spotted” refers to medium-sized and bigger spots. In that part of the world, most sheep were white and most goats were solid brown or black. So Jacob was asking for the irregular animals for himself, including white sheep with dark marks, dark-colored goats with light marks and dark-colored lambs. You could put some of this information in a footnote.

and the spotted and speckled {young} among the goats. 
“and {all} the young/kid goats that are spotted or speckled.”

And that will be my wages.
“They will be my wages/pay.” or “Those animals will be my wages/pay.”
 

Gen 30:33 So my righteousness will testify for me in future days when you go over my wages in front of you: any that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and dark-colored among the sheep, it was stolen {if it is} with me.”

So my righteousness will testify for me in future days 
“Also, in the future you will know whether or not I am being righteous/honest” or “That way {too}, in the future it will be easy {for you/everyone} to know whether {or not} I am being honest”. The phrase “my righteousness” is referred to here as if it can testify like a person can. Some languages cannot personify righteousness like that. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-personification)

when you go over my wages in front of you: 
“whenever you check the animals you have paid/given me.” For some languages it is more natural to move this clause earlier in this sentence and say, “Also, in the future, whenever you check the animals you have paid/given me, you will know whether or not I am being honest.” Do what is best in your own language. (See: figs-infostructure)

any that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and dark-colored among the sheep, 
“{If you see} that I have any {sheep or} goats that are not speckled or spotted, or any sheep/lambs that are not dark-colored,” or “{If you see/find} any {sheep or} goats {among my flocks} that do not have speckles or spots, or any sheep/lambs that are not dark-colored,”

it was stolen {if it is} with me.”
“{you will know that} I stole them {from you}.” or “{it will be obvious that} I stole them {from you}.”

Gen 30:35 Then on that day he removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, any that {had} white on it, and all the dark-colored {ones} among the lambs. Then he gave {them} into the hand of his sons, 

Then on that day 
“But that {same/very} day,” What Laban does in verse 35 does not follow the agreement he just made with Jacob in verses 32-34. (See: grammar-connect-logic-contrast)

he removed 
“Laban removed/separated {from his flocks}”. Make sure it is clear in your translation that this phrase refers to Laban, not Jacob (as verse 36 confirms).

the male goats that were streaked and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, 
“{all} the he-goats that had streaks or spots, and all the she-goats that had speckles or spots,”

any that {had} white on it, 
“any/all that {had any} white {marks} on them,” The goats were normally dark brown or black, so if they had streaks or spots on them those marks would be white. In the Hebrew text, there is a pun (play-on-words) in verses 35 and 37: the name “Laban” means “white”, so verse 35 literally says that any goats with “Laban” (“white”) on them became Jacob’s. You could include that information in a footnote.

and all the dark-colored {ones} among the lambs.
“together with all the dark-colored lambs.” or “as well as all the lambs that were dark-colored.”

Then he gave {them} into the hand of his sons,
“Then he had his sons tend {them},” or “Then he put his sons in charge of {them},” or “Then he told his sons to take care of {them},” (See: figs-idiom)

“Then Jacob cut {some} branches”

of poplar and almond and plane trees, 
“from poplar {trees}, almond/hazel {trees} and plane/chestnut {trees},” or “from three different kinds of trees,” If the three kinds of trees are not known in your language area, you could transliterate the names of the trees, or be more general and leave out the names (if they are too distracting). (See: translate-unknowns)

and peeled white stripes in them, 
“and peeled/stripped off long strips/pieces of bark,” or “and made white stripes/streaks on them {by stripping/peeling off long strips/pieces of bark},”

Then he put the branches that he had peeled in the troughs,
“Then he put/set those {striped/streaked} branches in all the {stone} drinking/watering troughs/tubs/places”. See how you translated “trough” in Gen 24:20.

in the water troughs where the flock{s} came to drink, 
“where the flock{s} came to drink,” or “that the flock{s} would come to drink from,” The way you translate this should allow for the fact that the animals came to the watering troughs repeatedly or regularly throughout the day, not just one time.

in front of the flock{s}. 
“in front of them.” or “so that the flock{s} would see the branches {there}.”

And they were in heat when they came to drink,
“The flocks {often} mated when they came {to the troughs/tubs} to drink,” or “{That way, whenever} the animals that were ready to mate/breed came {to the troughs/tubs} to drink,” The way you translate this clause will determine whether you begin the next verse with a conjunction (“and” or “so”) or without a conjunction. Do what is best in your language.


Gen 30:39 and the flock{s} would mate by the branches, and the flock{s} would bear streaked, speckled and spotted {young}. 

and the flock{s} would mate by the branches, 
“and/so they would mate in front of the branches,” or “they would mate where they could see the branches,” or “they would see the branches as they were mating/breeding,” Make sure your translation of the verbs in this verse refers to a repeated or habitual activity, not a one-time event.

and the flock{s} would bear streaked, speckled and spotted {young}.
“As a result, they would bear/have {young/offspring that were} streaked or speckled or spotted.” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. See how you translated “speckled” and “spotted” in verses 32-33 and 35. Also consider what is the most natural way in your language to refer to the flocks in verses 38 and 39. (See: writing-pronouns)


Gen 30:40 Then Jacob set apart the lambs, and he made the faces of the flock{s} look at the streaked and all the dark-colored {animals} in the flock{s} of Laban. And he put flocks for himself by themselves, and he did not put them with the flock{s} of Laban.

Then Jacob set apart the lambs, 
“Then Jacob separated those young animals {from Laban’s flocks} {to form/make new flocks for himself},” (See: figs-explicit)

and he made the faces of the flock{s} look at 
“and he put {the rest of} the flock{s} with”. The Hebrew text uses an idiom here that means Jacob put the marked and unmarked animals together (so that they would mate). (See: figs-idiom)

the streaked and all the dark-colored {animals} 
“all the streaked animals and dark-colored {animals}”. See how you translated “streaked” in verses 35 and 39, and how you translated “dark-colored” in verses 32-33 and 35.

in the flock{s} of Laban. 
“{that were} in Laban’s flock{s} {so that they would mate and have young/offspring/babies that were streaked or dark-colored}.” You may need to make it explicit in your translation why Jacob put the unmarked sheep and goats with Laban’s streaked and spotted animals, so that people understand what Jacob was doing. (See: figs-explicit)
 
And he put flocks for himself by themselves, 
“In that way, {over time} he created/formed/made separate flocks {of sheep and goats} for himself”

the face of Laban and behold he was not with him as
“that Laban no longer looked at him in a kind/friendly way as/like he did” or “that Laban was no longer pleased/happy with him as/like he used to be” or “that Laban no longer acted friendly toward him the way he used to”. The clause “he was not with him” is an idiom that means Laban was no longer happy with Jacob, or that he no longer liked him. Consider whether your language has a similar idiom that fits well here. (See: figs-idiom)

yesterday and three days ago.
“previously/before.” or “in the past.” (See: figs-idiom)


Gen 31:3 Then Yahweh said to Jacob, “Go back to the land of your fathers and to your relatives, and I will be with you.”

and changed my wages ten times. 
“by changing what he pays me ten times.” or “and ten times he has changed what he said that he would pay me.”

However God has not allowed him to harm me.
“However God has not permitted him to harm/hurt me.” or “However/But God has prevented/kept him from harming/hurting me.” or “However/But God has protected me so that he/Laban did/could not hurt/harm me.” In this context, “harm” especially refers to financial harm, but it can also include physical harm.


Gen 31:8 If he said like this: ‘The speckled animals will be your wages,’ then all the flock{s} bore speckled young. But if he said like this: ‘The streaked ones will be your wages,’ then all the flock{s} bore streaked young. 

If he said like this: 
“{For example,} if/whenever he told {me}” or {For example,} every time that he told {me}”. The examples Jacob is describing in verse 8 took place repeatedly (as verse 7 indicates). 

‘The speckled animals will be your wages,’
“that {only} the speckled animals would be my wages/pay,” or “that he would pay me by giving me {only} the animals with speckles on them,” Consider whether it is best in your language to translate this embedded quote as a direct or indirect quote. Also, see how you translated “speckled” in Gen 30:32, 33, 35, 39. (See: figs-quotations)

then all the flock{s}

Gen 31:10 And it happened in the season the flock{s} were in heat, and I lifted my eyes and saw in a dream that behold, the he-goats that were mounting the flock{s} {were} streaked, speckled and spotted. 

And it happened
“One time/night”

“during the season/time” or “during the time of year”

the flock{s} were in heat, and
“that/when the female sheep and goats were in heat,” or “that/when the flock{s} {of sheep and goats} were mating/breeding,”

I lifted my eyes and saw in a dream that behold,
“I had a dream and {in the dream} I looked around and saw that” or “I had a dream. {In the dream} I looked around and was surprised to see that”. The word “behold” emphasizes what Jacob saw and might also express that he was surprised at what he saw.

the he-goats that were mounting the flock{s} 
“the {only} male goats {and sheep} that were mating with the female goats {and sheep}”. Some languages have special terms for male and female goats or sheep. For example, billy goats and nanny goats (for male and female goats) and rams and ewes (for male and female sheep). Choose terms in your language that are natural and well-known.

{were} streaked, speckled and spotted.
“{were} streaked/striped, speckled or blotched.” or “had a streaked/striped, speckled or spotted/blotched pattern {in their fur/hair}.” It may be more natural to put this phrase earlier and say, “...saw that the male goats {and sheep} that were streaked, speckled and spotted were the {only} ones that were mating with the female goats {and sheep}.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 31:11 Then an angel of God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob!’ and I said, ‘Behold me.’

“Then/And an angel from God called to me in the dream {and said}, ‘Jacob!’ ” or “Then in the dream, one of God’s angels said/called to me, ‘Jacob!’ ” In some languages it is more natural to put “in the dream” earlier in this clause. Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated “an angel of God” in Gen 21:17. (See: translate-key-terms)

and I said, 
“and I answered/responded,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Then the angel said {to me},” or “The angel said/replied,” (See: writing-quotations)

‘Please lift up your eyes
“Look around you” or “Look carefully”. See how you translated this idiom in Gen 22:13. Also see how you translated Gen 22:2, another passage where Yahweh uses “Please”. (See: figs-idiom)

“{I, Yahweh, have caused that to happen,} because I have observed/noticed”. Sometimes an angel says “I” as God’s representative, but in this context, it seems to be Yahweh himself (in the form of an angel) who is speaking to Jacob (see verse 13). That information could be put in a footnote, and you could make “Yahweh” explicit in the text to make that clear. (See: figs-explicit)

where you vowed a vow to me.
“{and} where you made a vow/pledge/promise to me.” See how you translated “vowed a vow” in Gen 28:20. (See: translate-key-term)

Now get up, go out from this land 
“{So} now/then, get up/ready and leave this land/region {immediately}” or “Now go/leave at once from this land/region”. The phrase “get up” means that Jacob should immediately get ready to go and then leave; see how you translated this phrase in Gen 27:43. 

and return to 
“and go/travel back to”

the land of your birth.’ ”
“the land where you were born.” or “the land where your relatives live.” or “your native/home land.” The Hebrew word for “birth” in this phrase can also be translated as “relatives” here (as in verse 3). See how you translated this phrase in Gen 24:7.

“We no longer have any part/share in the inheritance” or “We will not/never inherit anything”. This rhetorical question expects the answer “no”. It also expresses Rachel and Leah’s strong emotion and emphasizes that there is nothing for them to inherit from their father. Consider whether or not a rhetorical question fits well here in your language. (See: figs-rquestion)

“from our father’s house/estate {when he dies}!” or “from our father {when he dies}” 
 

Gen 31:15 Are we not regarded by him {as} foreigners? For he sold us, and he has indeed completely eaten up our silver.

Are we not regarded by him 
“Doesn’t he regard/treat us” or “It is obvious that he regards/treats us” or “He obviously is treating us”. This rhetorical question expects the answer “yes” and expresses Rachel and Leah’s anger at how their father treats them. Consider whether or not it is natural in your language to use a rhetorical question here. (See: figs-rquestion)

{as} foreigners?
“like foreigners/strangers {not family}” or “as if we were foreigners/strangers {instead of family}”

For he sold us,
“For example, he sold us {to you},” or “After all, he sold us {to you},” This sentence is an example of how Laban treated his daughters like foreigners. 

and he has indeed completely eaten up 
“and then he spent all” or “and then he used up all”. The phrase “eaten up” is used here as an idiom that means Laban had spent or kept for himself all the wealth he had gained from Jacob’s 14 years of working for him. Many languages have a similar idiom that could be used here. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-idiom)

“the money/wealth that should have been ours.” or “the money/wealth that belonged to us.” In that culture at that time, silver was a currency used to buy and sell things. (See: translate-unknown)

“{rightfully/actually} {belongs} to us and our children.” or “{should have been given} to us and our children {anyway}.”

So now, do 
“So then, {you should} do” or “So {go ahead and} do” or “So {we totally agree that you should} do”. The words “So now” introduce Rachel and Leah’s conclusion that is based on what they just said. Do what is best in your language to communicate that.

“to go/return to his father Isaac’s house in the land/region of Canaan.” or “to go/return to Canaan, to {the home of} his father Isaac.” or “to the land/region of Canaan, where his father Isaac lived.” For some languages it is more natural to put this clause earlier in this verse and say, “Then he {started} driving/herding {the camels} and all his {other} animals to/toward the land/region of Canaan where his father Isaac lived. {He took with him} all his possessions that he had accumulated, {including} all the livestock that he had acquired/accumulated {while living} in {the land/region of} Paddan Aram.” Do what is best in your language.

Gen 31:19 Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep, so Rachel stole the idols that {belonged} to her father,

Now Laban 
“Now {before that,} Laban {the Aramean}”. Make sure it is clear in your translation that the events in verse 19 happened before Jacob and his family had left. Also, for some languages it is more natural to first make “the Aramean” explicit here in verse 19, rather than wait until verse 20. Do what is best in your language. (See: writing-background)

had gone to shear his sheep, 
“had gone away {for several days} to cut the wool off his sheep”. In that culture, sheep wool was very important since it was used to make clothing and blankets. The process of shearing many sheep would have taken several days. You could include some of this information in a footnote.

so Rachel 
“so {while he was gone,} Rachel” or “{While he was gone,} Rachel”. Consider whether it is more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here. 

stole

the idols that {belonged} to her father,
“his {household/family} idols/gods” or “the idols/gods that he had/worshiped”. These idols were statues made of wood or precious metals. They were small enough to be used in a private home. In this chapter these statues are referred to as “idols” (in verses 19, 34, 35 when the author refers to them) and “gods” (in quotes in verses 30 and 32 when Laban or Jacob talk about them). If it is confusing in your language to switch back and forth between these two terms, you could use “gods” throughout this chapter, since Laban would not have called them idols, nor would Jacob have used that term in his presence. However, if possible, it is best to translate the two terms the way the Hebrew text has them. (See: translate-unknown)


Gen 31:20 and Jacob stole the heart of Laban the Aramean by not informing him that he was fleeing.

“by not informing/telling him that he was fleeing/leaving.” or “by fleeing/leaving {secretly} without informing/telling him that he was leaving.” (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 31:21 And he fled and all that {belonged} to him. And he got up and crossed the River and set his face {toward} the mountain{s} of Gilead.

And he fled
“So Jacob {and his family} ran away” or “So {in that way} Jacob ran away {with his family}”. This statement summarizes an event that already happened (see verses 18 and 20). Make sure your translation of this verse does not sound like Jacob left a second time. To make this clear you could say, “After Jacob {and his family} ran away with everything that they owned, they {quickly} crossed the {Euphrates} River and headed toward the hill country of Gilead.” 

and all
“with all/everything” or “and {took/brought} all/everything”

that {belonged} to him.
“that {belonged} to them.” or “that he/they had/owned.” Make sure that your choice of pronouns throughout this verse fits with how you translate the beginning of this sentence. (See: writing-pronouns)

And he got up and crossed the River 
“He/They quickly crossed the {Euphrates} River”. The Euphrates River was also called “the River” because it was large and well-known. It was about 50 miles (80 kilometers) from Haran where Laban lived. This information could be put in a footnote. (See: figs-explicit)

and set his face {toward} 
“and headed toward” or “and went/traveled in the direction of” (See: figs-idiom)

the mountain{s} of Gilead.
“the mountain region of/called Gilead.” or “the hill country of/called Gilead.” The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can (1) refer to mountains or hill country (2) refer to a specific mountain (“Mount Gilead”).

Gen 31:25 And Laban overtook Jacob, and Jacob had pitched his tent{s} in the mountain{s}, so Laban with his relatives pitched {theirs} in the mountain{s} of Gilead.

And Laban overtook Jacob, and 
“So {when} Laban overtook Jacob,” or “{By the time that} Laban caught up with Jacob,” Make sure that the way you translate this clause does not sound like Laban overtook Jacob a second time. This is referring to what already happened in verse 23. See how you translated “overtook” there. (See: writing-background)

Jacob had pitched his tent{s}
“Jacob {and his family} had {already} set/put up his/their tents” or “Jacob {and his family} had {already} set up camp”. Make sure it is clear in your translation that Jacob had already pitched his tents before Laban arrived. Also see how you translated “pitched his tent” in Gen 12:8 and 26:25. (See: writing-background)

Gen 31:26 Then Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done? And you have stolen my heart and carried away my daughters like captives of the sword!

Then Laban 
“Then {the next day} Laban {went/came to Jacob and}” or “{The next day} Laban {met with Jacob and}”

said to Jacob,
“complained to Jacob/him,” or “{rebuked/confronted Jacob/him and} said to him,” See how you translated a similar quote margin in 29:25, when the roles were reversed and Jacob confronted Laban. (See: writing-quotations)

“What have you done? 
“Why have you done this?” or “Look what you have done!” or “What you have done is wrong!” Laban uses a rhetorical question here to express his anger at Jacob. Do what is best in your language to communicate that. (See: figs-rquestion)

And you have stolen my heart 
“You have deceived/tricked me” or “You have acted deceitfully toward me”. See how you translated the idiom “stole the heart of” in verse 20. (See: figs-idiom)

and carried away my daughters 
“and dragged away my daughters {with you}” or “and forced my daughters to leave {with you}”. Laban uses exaggeration to show he is angry and to try to make Jacob feel guilty for what he did. (See: figs-hyperbole)

like captives of the sword!
“like prisoners of war!” or “as if you had captured them in battle!” (See: figs-simile)


Gen 31:27 For what {reason} did you secretly flee and deceive me, and not tell me, so that I could have sent you with joy and with songs, with tambourines and with lyres?

For what {reason} did you secretly flee and deceive me, 
“Why did you deceive/trick me and secretly run away” or “Why did you deceive me by secretly running away” (See: figs-infostructure)

and not tell me
“without telling me {you were leaving}?” or “{Why} didn’t you tell me {that you were leaving}?” or “You should have told me {you were leaving}”. Verse 27 is one long rhetorical question in the Hebrew text that expresses Laban’s anger at Jacob. For some languages, it is better to break it up into two or more sentences. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-rquestion)

so that I could have sent you with joy and with songs, 
“{If I had known,} I/we could/would have {held a feast and} sent you {on your way}, singing joyful songs {together},” or “{If I had known,} I/we could/would have sent you {on your way} by {having a feast and} singing joyful songs {together},” If you begin a new sentence here in your translation, make sure it flows well with the rest of the verse. Also make sure it is clear that the events in this clause are contrary-to-fact (hypothetical). (See: figs-hypo)

with tambourine{s} and with lyre{s}?
“with tambourines and lyres/harps playing” or “with/to the music/sound/playing of musical instruments”. See how you translated “lyres” or “harps” in Gen 4:21. (See: translate-unknown)


Gen 31:28 And you did not let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters! Now you have acted foolishly by doing {that}!

And you did not let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters! 
“You did not {even} let me kiss my daughters and my grandchildren {goodbye} {before they left}!” or “{You left so secretly that} I wasn’t even able to say goodbye to my daughters and grandchildren!” For some languages, it may be more natural to mention the daughters before the children. Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated “kiss” in Gen 27:26-27, and see the note about that at 27:26. (See: figs-infostructure)

Now you have acted foolishly by doing {that}!
What you have done is {very} foolish/stupid!” or “You acted foolishly when you left {secretly} like that!”


Gen 31:29 It is in the power of my hand to do harm to you, but last night the God of your father said to me, saying, ‘Keep yourself from speaking with Jacob either good or bad.’

It is in the power of my hand to do harm to you, 
“I {and my relatives/men} have the power/ability to harm {all of} you,” The pronoun “you” is plural here, so it probably refers to Jacob and everyone in his household. (See: figs-yousingular)

but last night 
“but last night {in a dream}”. For some languages it may be more natural to put this time phrase later and say “…said to me {in a dream} last night”. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

the God of your father 
“the God whom your father serves”. See how you translated a similar phrase (“the God of my father”) in verse 5.

So now, you have surely gone
“Now then, {I know/understand that} you left” or “Now, {I know/understand that} you went/ran away”. Begin this verse in a way which shows that Laban is introducing a new topic. Also notice that “you” shifts to singular here in verse 30. (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)

because you greatly long
“because you longed so much” or “because you were so/very homesick”

for the house of your father. 
“to return to your father’s household/family,” or “to return home to your father {and other relatives},” This phrase refers to the people in Jacob’s father’s household and other relatives living nearby. (See: figs-metonymy)

For what {reason} did you steal my gods?”
“{but} what is the reason that you stole my gods?” or “{but} why did you steal my gods?”

Now Rachel had taken the idols and put them inside the camel’s saddle
“Now/But Rachel had put the idols inside {her} camel saddlebag {to hide them}” or “But Rachel had hidden the idols inside her camel saddlebag”. This kind of saddle was used as a seat and also had compartments or bags for carrying things. Make sure it is clear in your translation that Rachel had hidden the idols before Laban entered her tent. Also see how you translated “idols” in verse 19. (See: writing-background)

Make sure you translate “my lord” in a way that is appropriate for a daughter to show respect to her father; it should not sound like she was Laban’s slave or servant. The word “burn” is used here as an idiom that means to be angry. Consider whether your language has a similar idiom that would work well here. Also see how you translated this idiom in Gen 30:2.

“and at night {I suffered from} the frost/cold, so that” or “and during the nights it was so cold that”

my sleep fled from my eyes.
“I could not sleep.” or “I could hardly sleep.”


Gen 31:41 That {is how it was} for me twenty years in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock{s}, and you changed my wages ten times. 

That {is how it was} for me 
“That {is what it was like} for me” or “{It was like} that for me” 

twenty years in your house. 
“{for/during the} twenty years that I worked for you.” or “{during the entire} twenty years that I was with you.”

I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, 
“I worked for you for fourteen years in order to marry your two daughters,” or “For fourteen years I worked for you {in exchange} for {marrying} your two daughters,”

and six years for your flock{s}, 
“and {I worked} {another} six years to earn flocks {of animals} from you,” or “and for six {more} years {I worked for you} to earn flocks {of sheep and goats} from you,”

and you changed my wages ten times.
“even though you changed my wages/pay ten times.” or “even though ten times you changed what you said you would pay me.” See how you translated a similar phrase in verse 7.
 

Gen 31:42 If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed. God has seen my affliction and the toil of my palms, and he judged {you} last night.”

If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac,
“If God, the Revered/Awesome One, whom my father Isaac and {grandfather} Abraham serve/worship” or “If God whom my ancestors Abraham and Isaac serve/worship and fear/revere”. The phrase “the Fear of Isaac” is a title for God that is ambiguous in Hebrew (and English). It could mean: 1) “the One/God whom Isaac fears/reveres”; or 2) “Isaac’s God whom {people/others} are afraid/terrified of”. The interpretation that is not used in your translation could be put in a footnote. Make sure it is clear in your translation that Jacob is only talking about one God in this verse, not two or three. Also notice that “my father” and “Isaac” both refer to Jacob’s father Isaac, not two different people.

had not been with me, 
“had not been with me {taking care of me},” or “had not been with me {protecting me and guiding me},” Make sure it is clear in your translation that the events in this sentence are contrary-to-fact (hypothetical). (See: figs-hypo)

surely now you would have sent me away 
“you would certainly be sending me away now” or “there is no doubt/question that I would now be leaving”

empty-handed.
“with {absolutely} nothing.” or “without anything {at all}.”

God has seen my affliction 
“{But} God knows how much I have suffered {under you}” or “{But} God knows how {much} you have afflicted/oppressed/mistreated me”

and the toil of my palms, 
“and the hard work I did with my hands {for you},” or “and how hard I have worked {for you},” (See: figs-synecdoche)

and he judged {you} last night.”
“so last night he judged {against you} {in my favor}.” or “so last night he rebuked {you}.” See how you translated “judge” in verse 37. It may be necessary to translate this word in different ways, depending on the context.
 

31:43-55 Jacob And Laban Cut A Covenant
 
Gen 31:43 And Laban responded and said to Jacob, “The daughters {are} my daughters, and the children {are} my grandchildren, and the flock{s} {are} my flock{s}. And everything that you see {belongs} to me! But what can I do today about these daughters of mine or about their children whom they have born? 

And Laban responded and said to Jacob,
“Then Laban responded to Jacob,” or “Laban replied to Jacob,” (See: writing-quotations)

“The daughters {are} my daughters, and the children {are} my grandchildren, 
“These women {are} my daughters and their children {are} my grandchildren,” or “These {are} my daughters and my grandchildren,”

and the flock{s} {are} my flock{s}.
“and these flock{s} {are} {also} mine.” or “and these flock{s}/animals {also} belong to me.”

And everything that you see {belongs} to me! 
“In fact, everything/all that you see {here} is mine!” or “Yes, everything that is here with you is {actually} mine!” Laban is lying or exaggerating here to make it sound like he was wronged, when actually he is the one who was dishonest in his dealings with Jacob. (See: figs-hyperbole)

But what can I do today 
“But/Yet there is nothing I can do today/now” or “But I can’t do anything now”. Laban uses this rhetorical question to express his emotions and emphasize that there is nothing that he can do. Consider whether or not a rhetorical question fits well here in your language. (See: figs-rquestion)

about these daughters of mine or about their children whom they have born?
“to keep my daughters and their children near me {any longer}!” or “to keep my daughters and grandchildren from leaving!”


Gen 31:44 So now, come, let us cut a covenant, I and you, and let it be a witness between me and you.” 

So now, come, let us cut a covenant, I and you, 
“So then, you and I should make a {peace} covenant/treaty {with each other},” or “So I invite you to make a covenant/treaty with me,” For some languages it may be more natural to put “I” and “you” earlier in the sentence. Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated “So now” in verse 16 and “cut a covenant” in Gen 26:28. (See: figs-infostructure)

and let it be 
“and let there be” or “and there should be”. The subject of the Hebrew verb in this phrase is masculine singular, so it cannot refer to “covenant”, which is feminine singular. It is probably best to translate this phrase in a more general way (see the alternate translations above).

a witness between me and you.”
“a witness/memorial to remind us {of our treaty/covenant}.” or “something to remind us {to keep that covenant/treaty}.” If your language has a dual pronoun for “us”, you could use it in this verse. Also, if your language distinguishes exclusive and inclusive pronouns, you could use the inclusive form of “us” here. (See: figs-exclusive)


Gen 31:45 So Jacob took a stone and set it up {as} a pillar.

So Jacob took a stone 
“So Jacob picked out a {large} stone”. See how you translated “stone” in Gen 28:18.

and set it up {as} a pillar. 
“and set/stood it up {on its end} {as} a monument {to mark the place where they made their treaty/covenant}.” or “and set/stood it up {as} a memorial/reminder stone {to mark the place as special}.” See how you translated “pillar” in verse 13 and “set it up as a pillar” in Gen 28:18, 22. 


Gen 31:46 Then Jacob said to his relatives, “Gather stones.” So they took stones and made a heap. Then they ate there by the heap. 

Then Jacob said to his relatives, 
“Then Jacob/he told his relatives,” These relatives would have included Jacob’s sons, as well as Laban and his men who had come with him. See how you translated “relatives” in verses 23, 25, 32, 37.

“Gather stones.”
“Gather {some more} stones.” or “{Please} gather {some} stones.” Make sure that your translation of Jacob’s request sounds polite here, not rude or demanding, but also not begging. (See: figs-politeness)
 
So they took stones and made a heap. 
“So they {all} gathered/brought/got stones and put them in a {large} pile/mound.”

Then they 
“Then they {all}” or “Then everyone”. Make sure your translation does not sound like Jacob ate without Laban and his men.

ate there 
“ate {a meal together} there”

by the heap. 
“near the heap/pile {of stones}.” or “next to the pile/mound {of stones}.”


Gen 31:47 And Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed. 

And Laban called it 
“Laban gave the heap/pile/place the {Aramaic} name”

Jegar Sahadutha, 
“Jegar Sahadutha {which means “witness heap/pile/mound”},” or “Jegar Sahadutha {which means “heap/pile that reminds”},” If the meaning of “Jegar Sahadutha” and “Galeed” is included in your translation or in a footnote, be sure that it fits with how you translate “heap/pile/mound” in verses 46 and 48, and “witness” in verse 48. (See: translate-names)

but Jacob called it Galeed.
“but/whereas Jacob gave it the {Hebrew} name Galeed {which has the same meaning}.”
 

Gen 31:48 And Laban said, “This heap {is} a witness between me and you today.” For that {reason} he called its name Galeed. 

And Laban said, 
“Then Laban said {to Jacob/him},” or “Laban said {to him/Jacob},” (See: writing-quotations)

“This heap {is} a witness between me and you today.” 
“This heap/pile {of stones} is to remind us {to keep our peace treaty/covenant}.” or “{Starting} today, when we see this pile/mound {of stones}, we will remember {our peace treaty/covenant}.” 

For that {reason} 
“That is the reason” or “That is why”

he called its name Galeed.
“they/people call it Galeed.” or “that place is called Galeed.” or “the name of that place is Galeed.” The phrase “he called its name” is used here as an idiom that is very general and means “they/people call it”; it does not refer to Laban. Make sure that is clear in your language. See how you translated this idiom in Gen 11:9.


Gen 31:49 {It is} also Mizpah, because he said, “May Yahweh watch between me and you when we are hidden one from the other.

{It is} also Mizpah, 
“{It is/was} also {called/named} Mizpah,” or “People also call {the place,} Mizpah,” or “{Another name for the place is} Mizpah, {which means “watchtower,”}”

because he said,
“because Laban said {to Jacob},” Make sure that your translation of “he” refers here to Laban. (See: writing-pronouns)

“May Yahweh watch between me and you
“May Yahweh watch both/each of us” or “May Yahweh keep watch on/over us”

 when we are hidden one from the other. 
“while we are out of each other’s sight {and hold both of us responsible for keeping our covenant/treaty with each other}.” or “{to make sure we keep our covenant/treaty} while we are apart/away from each other.” The pronoun “we” is inclusive here and includes both Laban and Jacob. Some languages have a dual pronoun that fits here well. Do what is natural in your language. (See: figs-dualpronoun)


Gen 31:50 If you afflict my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, {even though} there is not someone with us, behold, God {is} a witness between me and you.”

If you afflict my daughters, 
“If you treat my daughters badly,” or “If you mistreat/oppress my daughters,” See how you translated “afflict” in Gen 15:13 and 16:6, and how you translated a related word (“affliction”) in verse 42.

or if you take wives besides my daughters, 
“or if you marry {other} wives/women besides them,”

{even though} there is not someone with us, behold, 
“{even if} no one {else} is watching us, don’t forget {that}” or “remember {that} {even if} no one {else} is watching us,” See how you translated the pronoun “we” in verse 49. (See: figs-dual)

God {is} a witness between me and you.”
“God is {always} watching both of us {to hold us accountable}.” or “God always sees/watches us {and will punish us if we break our covenant/treaty}.” In his role as witness, God would also punish anyone who broke the covenant. You could make this information explicit in your translation, or put it in a footnote. (See: figs-explicit)

Gen 31:51 Then Laban said to Jacob, “Behold this heap, and behold the pillar which I set up between me and you. 

Then Laban said to Jacob,
“Then Laban {also} said to Jacob,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Behold 
“See” or “Here is” or “Look at”

this heap, 
“this heap/pile/mound {of stones},” See how you translated “heap” in verses 46 and 48.

and behold 
“and here is” or “and see” or “and look at”

the pillar 
“this monument” or “this memorial/reminder stone”. See how you translated “pillar” in verse 45.

which I set up between me and you.
“which I {helped} set up between us {to remind us to keep our peace treaty}.” or “which we set/stood up between us {to remind us about our peace covenant/treaty}.” Jacob set up the stone as a pillar, but Laban and Jacob, along with their relatives, worked together to make the pile of stones.


Gen 31:52 This heap {is} a witness and the pillar {is} a witness that I will not pass by this heap to you, and that you will not pass by this heap and this pillar to me, to do harm. 

This heap {is} a witness and the pillar {is} a witness 
“This heap/pile {of stones} {is} a witness/reminder and this pillar {is} {also} a witness/reminder” or “This pile/mound {of stones} and this monument/memorial {both} remind us”. See how you translated “witness” in verses 44 and 48.

that I will not pass by this heap to you, 
“that I will/must never go past this heap/pile/mound to {harm/attack} you,” Laban and Jacob could go to each other’s homes in peace, but not to harm each other.

and that you will not pass by this heap and this pillar to me, to do harm.
“and that you will/must never go past this heap/pile/mound and this monument/memorial to harm/attack me.” 


Gen 31:53 May the God of Abraham and the gods of Nahor, the gods of their father, judge between us!” Then Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac, 

May the God of Abraham 
“May {your grandfather} Abraham’s God” or “May the God whom your grandfather Abraham served/worshiped”. See how you translated a similar phrase in Gen 28:13.

and the gods of Nahor, the gods of their father, 
“and {my grandfather} Nahor’s gods, {which were also} their/his father {Terah}’s gods,” or “and the gods that {my grandfather} Nahor and his father {Terah} worshiped/served”. Abraham trusted in Yahweh, the one and only true God (Gen 15:6). Terah worshiped other gods (Joshua 24:2), and so did Laban (verses 19, 30), which suggests that Nahor served the same gods that his father Terah served, and then taught his son Laban to do the same thing. In spite of that, many translations still capitalize “God” all three times here in verse 53. Be consistent here with how you spelled “Nahor” in Gen 29:5 and 31:53.

judge between us!”
“judge between us {and punish us if we break this/our covenant/treaty}!”

Then Jacob swore 
“But Jacob swore” or “Then/But Jacob made/vowed a vow”. Jacob refused to swear by the gods of Nahor and Terah. See how you translated “swore” in Gen 26:31, and compare that to how you translated a related phrase (“vowed a vow”) in 31:13. (See: translate-key-term)

by the Fear of his father Isaac,
“by the God whom his father Isaac feared/revered, {that he would keep their treaty,}” or “with the Fear/God of his father Isaac as his witness/enforcer,” See how you translated “the Fear of Isaac” in verse 42.


Gen 31:54 and Jacob sacrificed a sacrifice on the mountain. Then he called his relatives to eat bread. Then they ate bread and spent the night on the mountain.

and Jacob sacrificed a sacrifice 
“and Jacob/he offered an animal sacrifice {to God} {on an altar}” or “and Jacob/he burned {the body of} an animal {on an altar} as a sacrifice {to God}”. Make sure your translation does not sound like Jacob burned the animal while it was still alive. Also see how you translated “sacrificed” in Gen 22:13. 

on the mountain.
“on the/a mountain/hill.” 

Then he called his relatives to eat bread. 
“Then he invited his relatives to eat a meal {together} {there}.” In the Bible, “bread” is often used as an idiom that refers to food in general. In this context, it was a meal that they shared together. Make sure that is clear in your translation. (See: figs-synecdoche)

Then they ate bread and spent the night on the mountain.
“Then after they had eaten the meal, they spent the night {there} on the/that mountain/hill.” or “So they {all} ate the meal {together} and spent the night there.” As in Genesis 26:30, eating together was an important part of the covenant or treaty process, since it shows unity and close relationship as if they were part of the same family. Some of that information could be included in a footnote. (See: translate-symaction)

Gen 31:55 Then in the morning Laban got up early and kissed his grandchildren and his daughters, and he blessed them. Then Laban left and returned to his place.

Although verse 55 is the last verse of chapter 31 in most modern Bibles, it is the first verse of chapter 32 in the Hebrew text. We suggest that you follow the verse numbering in the Bibles in your national language or in other well-known languages in your area.

“The next morning Laban got up early” or “Early the next morning Laban got up”. See how you translated a similar clause in Gen 28:18.

32:1-21 Jacob Prepares To Meet Esau

Gen 32:1 Then Jacob went on his way, and angels of God met him.

Then Jacob went on his way,
“Then/Meanwhile Jacob {also} {left from there and} went/continued on his way/journey {home} {with his family},” You can make implied information explicit in your translation if it is necessary to make the meaning accurate and clear. (See: figs-explicit)

and angels of God met him.
“and {some} angels from God met/encountered him.” Translate “met” in a way that allows for the fact that no conversation is recorded between the angels and Jacob, and that the angels were probably not hostile, but may have been sent by God to escort and protect him. 

   
Gen 32:2 And when he saw them, Jacob said, “This {is} God’s camp!” So he called the name of that place Mahanaim.

And when he saw them, Jacob said,
“When Jacob saw the angels, he said/exclaimed {in surprise},” Make sure that you refer to Jacob and the angels here in a way that is accurate and natural in your language. (See: writing-pronouns)

“This {is} God’s camp!”
“God’s camp/army must be here/nearby!” or “God’s army is {stationed/camping} here!”

So he called the name of that place Mahanaim.
“So he named that place Mahanaim, {which means “two camps/armies.”}” If you include the meaning of the name “Mahanaim” in your translation or in a footnote, be sure it matches the way you translated “God’s camp” earlier in the verse, so that it is clear why Jacob gave the place that name. Also see how you translated “he called the name of that place” in Gen 28:19. (See: translate-names)

And he commanded them, saying,
“{Before/As they left,} he ordered/instructed them,” (See: writing-quotations)

“This {is what} you will say to my lord, to Esau: 
“This {is what} you must tell my master Esau:” or “I want you to tell Esau whom I highly respect:” Jacob uses “my lord” and “your servant” in verse 4 and 5 to show his brother Esau great respect. Do this in a way that is natural in your language. (See: figs-honorifics)

‘This {is what} your servant Jacob says, 
“I, your servant Jacob, want you to know that” or “This is a message from Jacob who wants to serve you:” Verses 4 and 5 have two levels of embedded quotes. Some languages need to use indirect quotes for one or both of those levels. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: “Your servant Jacob wants you to know that he has been sojourning/staying with {your uncle} Laban all this time.” (See: figs-quotesinquotes)

“I have been sojourning with Laban and have remained there until now.
“I have been staying with {our uncle} Laban all this time.” or “Since we last saw each other, I have been staying/living with {Uncle} Laban.”

And I have sent {messengers} to speak with my lord,
“I have sent this message to {you,} sir,” or “Sir, I sent these messengers to you,” If you use indirect quotes in this section, make sure each part fits with the other parts, especially in your choice of pronouns. It is helpful if you read your translation aloud to check for accuracy and naturalness. Alternate translation: “Also {tell him that} I have/own...., and that the reason I sent messengers to him is that I want to serve him and I hope I will find favor in his eyes.” (See: figs-honorifics)

Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated “I will cause things to prosper with you” in verse 9, and how you translated “as the sand” in Gen 22:17. (See: figs-quotesinquotes)

And also say, ‘Behold, your servant Jacob {is} behind us.’ ”
“Especially be sure to tell {him}, ‘Your servant Jacob is following us {here}.’ ” or “Especially be sure to tell {him} that his servant Jacob is following you {there}.” See how you translated “is behind us” in verse 18. (See: figs-quotesinquotes)

For he said, 
“{Jacob did all that,} because he said/thought,”

“I will cover his face with
“I will/can appease/pacify Esau by sending” or “Perhaps Esau will stop being angry at me if I send”. The idiom “cover his face” means to try to calm someone’s anger by doing something to please him. Consider whether your language has a similar idiom you could use here. (See: figs-idiom)

the gift that is going before me, 
“him this gift/present {of animals} ahead of me” or “this gift {of animals} to him ahead of me”. For some languages it is more natural to use an indirect quote here and say, “because he thought that if he sent the gifts {of animals} ahead of himself {to Esau}, then Esau would stop being angry at him.” Notice that this alternate translation also changes the clause order. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

and after that, when I see his face, perhaps he will receive my face.”
“After that, perhaps he will {forgive me} and welcome/accept me when we see each other face-to-face.” or “He was hoping that when Esau saw the gifts, he would {forgive him and} welcome him when they met in person.” Make sure that the way you translate this clause fits with how you translated the previous clauses as either a direct or indirect quote. (See: figs-quotations)


Gen 32:21 Then the gift went before him, and he himself stayed for that night in the camp.

Then the gift went before him, 
“Then/So the {animal} gifts {for Esau} were taken ahead of Jacob {by his servants},” or “So Jacob’s servants {went} ahead of Jacob with the {animal} gifts {for Esau},” See how you translated “gift” in verses 13, 18, 20.

32:22-32 Jacob Wrestles With God, Who Names Him Israel

Gen 32:22 Then during that night he got up and took his two wives and his two maidservants and his eleven sons and crossed over the ford of the Jabbok.

Then during that night 
“{Later} that {same} night” or “{Sometime} during that night”. Make sure it is clear in your translation that this is the same night that was referred to in verse 21.

he got up and took
“Jacob got/woke up and took”. The phrase “got up” often refers to initiating an action, but here it may also imply that Jacob got up out of bed after sleeping for a while.

his two wives and his two maidservants and his eleven sons
“his two wives, his two servant wives and his eleven sons” or “his two wives, two concubines and eleven sons”. Consider what is the best way in your language to list these people. See what you did for a similar list of people in Gen 7:13.

and crossed over 
“and waded/walked across” or “across”

the ford of the Jabbok.
“a shallow place on/in the Jabbok {Stream/River}.” or “a place in the Jabbok {Stream/River} that was shallow.” A ford is a very shallow place in a stream that is fairly easy and safe for people and animals to walk across. The Jabbok Stream was a small river that flowed from east to west into the Jordan River about halfway between the Dead Sea and the Sea of Galilee. Jacob took his wives and children from the north side of the stream to the south side; his brother was coming towards them from further south. It might be helpful to include a map here in your translation that includes the places named in this chapter and shows where Jacob and Esau were coming from.


Gen 32:23 So he took them and had them cross over the stream, then he sent what {belonged} to him across.

So he took them and had them cross over the stream, then 
“{After} he had taken them across the stream/river,” or “After he did that,” Verse 23 refers back to what already happened in verse 22. Make sure your translation does not sound like Jacob’s wives and children crossed the Jabbok Stream twice in verses 22-23.

he sent 
“he {went back and} had his servants take”. At some point, Jacob went back to the north side of the Jabbok Stream, while his family waited for him on the south side. (See: figs-explicit)

what {belonged} to him 
“{all} his {livestock/animals and other} belongings/possessions” or “{everything} that he owned”. These belongings included the animals that Jacob had not sent ahead to Esau, as well as all his other possessions.

across. 
“across {the stream/river} {too}.”


Gen 32:24 Then Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until the dawn came up.

Then Jacob was left alone, 
“Then Jacob was {there} by himself {for a while},” or “After that, Jacob was alone {there} {for a while},”

and a man wrestled with him 
“and/but {then} a man {came and} wrestled/fought with him”. At some point, Jacob realized that this man was Yahweh in the form of a man (verse 30), so translation teams that capitalize references to God capitalize all the pronouns that refer to him in verses 24-29, and may or may not capitalize “Man” in these verses. See what you did for a similar case when Yahweh appeared as a man to Abraham in Gen 18. (See: grammar-honorifics)

until the dawn came up.
“until dawn/daybreak.” or “until daylight started to appear.” The word “dawn” refers to the time before sunrise when the sky begins to get light.


Gen 32:25 And he saw that he was not prevailing over him, so he touched {him} on the socket of his hip, so that the socket of Jacob’s hip was dislocated as he wrestled with him.

And he saw that he was not prevailing over him, so 
“Then the man realized that he could not overpower/defeat him/Jacob, so” or “When the man saw/realized that he was not able to defeat him/Jacob,” Make sure it is clear in your translation who is being referred to in verses 25-29. (See: writing-pronouns)

he touched {him} on the socket of his hip, 
“he struck/hit {him/Jacob} on his hip,” or “he touched/struck his/Jacob’s hip joint,” (See: writing-pronouns)

so that the socket of Jacob’s hip 
“so that it” or “and his hip joint”. Consider whether it is more natural in your language to use a noun phrase or a pronoun here to refer to Jacob’s hip joint. (See: writing-pronouns)

was dislocated
“was wrenched/knocked/put out of place” or “went out of place”. Consider whether it is better in your language to use an active or passive clause here. (See: figs-activepassive)

as he wrestled with him.
“as he/Jacob wrestled/fought with the man.” or “as they wrestled/fought with/against each other.” 


Gen 32:26 Then he said, “Release me, because the dawn has come up!” But he said, “I will not release you unless you bless me!”

Then he said,
“Then the man said {to him/Jacob},” or “Then the man demanded,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Release me, 
“Let go of me,” or “{You must} let me go {now},”

because the dawn has come up!” 
“because it is dawn/daybreak!” or “because daylight is beginning to come!” See how you translated “the dawn came up” in verse 24.

But he said, 
“But Jacob said/replied {to him},” (See: writing-quotations)

“I will not release you unless you bless me!”
“{No!} I will not let go of you until you {first} bless me!” or “{No!} {First} you must bless me, then I will let you go!” or “Only if/after you bless me will I let you go!” (See: grammar-connect-exceptions)


Gen 32:27 So he said to him, “What {is} your name?” And he said, “Jacob.”

So he said to him, 
“So/Then the man asked him/Jacob” (See: writing-quotations)

“What {is} your name?” 
“Tell me your name.” or “what his name was.” Consider whether it is better to use a direct or indirect quote here in your language. (See: figs-quotations)

And he said, “Jacob.”
“He/Jacob answered {him}, “{My name is} Jacob.” ” or “And he told him his name was Jacob.” or “And Jacob told him his name.” Make sure in your translation that Jacob’s reply sounds respectful. Also consider whether it is better to use a direct or indirect quote here in your language. (See: figs-quotations)
 

Gen 32:28 Then he said, “Your name will not be called Jacob any more, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with men, and you have prevailed.”

Then he said, 
“Then the man said {to Jacob},”

“Your name will not be called Jacob any more,
“Your name will no longer be Jacob,” or “You will no longer be called/named Jacob,” The wording here is similar to what God said when he changed Abram’s name to Abraham (Gen 17:5) and Sarai’s name to Sarah (17:15). After that, Abraham and Sarah were no longer called by their previous names. In the case of Jacob, he continues to be referred to by both of his names in this chapter (“Jacob” in verses 29-30, 32; “Israel” in verse 32) and throughout the rest of the Bible, including by God (Gen 46:2). It could be that although God was changing Jacob’s primary name to “Israel”, he was still known by his previous name too. You could put some of that information in a footnote.

but Israel, 
“but {rather} {it will be} Israel, {which means “he who struggles/contends with God,”}” If you include the meaning of the name “Israel” in your translation or in a footnote, make sure it fits with how you translate “struggled” in the following clause. (See: translate-names)

because you have struggled with God and with men, 
“because you have struggled/contended with/against {both} God and men/people,” The Hebrew word for “struggled” here is more general than the word for “wrestled” in verses 24 and 25.

and you have prevailed.”
“and you have won/overcome.” See how you translated “prevailed” in verse 25 and Gen 30:8. It may be necessary to translate this term in slightly differently ways, depending on the context.

Gen 32:29 Then Jacob asked and said, “Please tell {me} your name.” But he said, “Why {is} this you are asking for my name?” Then he blessed him there.

Then Jacob asked and said, 
“Then Jacob asked him” or “Then Jacob asked the man”. Consider again whether or not you have capitalized references to the man in verses 24-29. See the note about this at verse 24. (See: grammar-honorifics)

“Please tell {me} your name.”
“What is your name?” or “what his name was.” or “to tell him his name.” Consider whether it is better to use a direct or indirect quote here in your language. (See: figs-quotations)

But he said, 
“But he replied,” or “But the man replied,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Why {is} this you are asking
“There is no need for you to ask” or “You do not need to ask”. This rhetorical question probably means that there was no need for Jacob to ask the man what his name was; he should have known without asking. Consider whether or not it is best to use a rhetorical question here in your language. (See: figs-rquestion)

“{me} to tell you my name!” or “{me} what my name is!”

Then he blessed him there.
“Then the man blessed Jacob there.” (See: writing-pronouns)


Gen 32:30 So Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, because {he said}, “I saw God face-to-face, but my life was preserved!”

So Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, 
“So/Then Jacob named the/that place Peniel, {which means “face of God,”}”

because {he said},
“because {he exclaimed},”

“I saw God face-to-face,
“I saw God’s face {here},” or “I saw/met God in person {here},” (See: figs-idiom)

but my life was preserved!”
“but/and {yet} my life was spared {by him}!” or “but/and {yet} he has allowed me to live!”
Jacob was amazed that he was still alive, because although there were exceptions (Exodus 33:11; Judges 13:22), normally people could not see God face-to-face and live (Exodus 33:20). You could put that information in a footnote so that readers understand why Jacob was surprised.

And the sun rose on him 
“The sun shined on Jacob” or “The sun was rising/shining”

as he passed Penuel, 
“as he/Jacob left Penuel {and returned to his family}.” Penuel is another name for the place that is called Peniel in verse 30. That information could be put in a footnote. Or you could use the same spelling in both verses to avoid confusion; “Penuel” is the spelling in the rest of the Old Testament. (See: translate-names)

33:1-20 Jacob Reconciles With Esau And Settles In Shechem

Gen 33:1 Then Jacob lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, Esau was coming, and with him 400 men. Then he divided the children among Leah and Rachel and the two maidservants.

Then Jacob lifted his eyes and looked, 
“Then Jacob looked up and saw” or “Then Jacob looked {ahead of him} and saw”. Make sure your translation of this idiom does not mean that Jacob looked straight up, rather he probably looked carefully to the south (the direction that his brother was coming from). (See: figs-idiom)

and behold, Esau was coming, 
“{in the distance} that Esau was coming {toward him},” or “that Esau was {in the distance} coming/heading {his direction/way},” Esau was still a fair distance away, which gave Jacob time to do everything that he does in verses 1-3.

and with him 400 men. 
“and with him {were} 400 men!” or “with 400 men!” or “and that he had 400 men with him!”

Then he divided the children among Leah and Rachel and the two maidservants.
“Then/So he/Jacob {quickly} separated/put his children into groups with {their own mothers,} Leah, Rachel and {his} two servant wives.” or “Then/So he/Jacob had his children {quickly} gather/stand with their own mothers, so that Leah, Rachel and {his} two concubines were each with her own children.” Each of the women had her own children with her (verse 2). See how you translated “divided” in Gen 32:7 and “his two maidservants” in Gen 32:22.


Gen 33:2 And he put the maidservants and their children first, and Leah and her children after them, and Rachel and Joseph after them.

And he put the maidservants and their children 
“He put his {two} servant wives and/with their children” or “He put the group that had/included his {two} servant wives and their children”. See how you translated “his two maidservants” in Gen 32:22.

first, 
“first {in line},” or “in front {of all the others},” For some languages it is more natural to put phrases like “first” and “after them” at the beginning of their clauses and say, “First {in line} he put his {two} servant wives and/with their children. Behind them {he put} Leah and/with her children, and last {of all} {he put} Rachel and/with {her son} Joseph.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

Gen 33:3 Then he himself went before them, and he bowed to the ground seven times as he came near to his brother.

Then he himself went before them, 
“Then Jacob himself went/walked ahead of them {all} {toward his brother},” or “Then he/Jacob started going/walking {toward his brother} ahead of them {all},”

and he bowed to the ground seven times as he came near to his brother.
“and he bowed {with his face} to the ground seven times {to show respect} as he went/got closer to him/Esau.” or “and as he approached him/Esau, he prostrated himself {with his face} to the ground seven times {to show respect}.” See how you translated “bow down” in Gen 27:29. (See: translate-symaction)

Gen 33:4 But Esau ran to meet him and embraced him, and he fell on his neck and kissed him, and they cried.

But Esau ran to meet him and embraced him, 
“But Esau ran to greet Jacob and hugged him”. This sentence shows a contrast between what Jacob was expecting and what actually happened. (See: grammar-connect-logic-contrast)

and he fell on his neck and kissed him, 
“and he threw/put his arms around his neck/shoulders and kissed him,” or “He held him/Jacob tightly and kissed him {on the cheeks},” See how you translated “hugged him...and kissed him {on the cheeks}” in Gen 29:13. Make sure that the way you translate “fell on his neck” does not imply that Esau accidentally fell. Rather, this is an idiom that means he embraced Jacob warmly, with much emotion. (See: figs-idiom)

and they cried. 
“and/as they {both} cried {for joy}.” or “Both of them cried {because they were so happy to see each other again}.” Consider whether or not to begin a new sentence here in your language. Also, some languages have a dual pronoun for “they” that could be used here. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-youdual)


Gen 33:5 Then he lifted his eyes and saw the women and the children, and he said, “Who {are} these with you?” And he said, “The children whom God has graciously given to your servant.” 

Then he lifted his eyes 
“Then Esau looked up/ahead”. See how you translated the idiom “lifted...eyes” in verse 1 and Gen 31:10. It may be necessary to translate this idiom in different ways, depending on the context. (See: figs-idiom)

and saw the women and the children,
“and saw/noticed the women and children {who were there} {with/behind Jacob},”

and he said, 
“so he asked {him/Jacob},” (See: writing-quotations)

“Who {are} these with you?”
“Who {are} these {people}? {Do they belong} to you?” or “How are these people related to you?” Esau wants to know if these people are Jacob’s family members or his servants or someone else; he is not asking what their names are.

And he said, 
“He/Jacob answered {him/Esau},” Make sure it is clear in your translation who is speaking to whom here. (See: writing-pronouns)

“The children 
“{They are} the children {and the wives}” or “{They are} {the/my wives and} the/my children”

whom God has graciously given to your servant.”
“whom God has graciously/kindly given to {me,} your servant.” or “whom God has graciously/kindly given to me, sir.” Jacob uses the phrase “your servant” to be polite and show respect to Esau; he was not actually Esau’s servant. For some languages it is more natural to put the honorific title first in this sentence and say, “Sir, {they are} the {wives and} children whom God has graciously given to me.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 33:6 Then the maidservants came near, they and their children, and they bowed down.

Then the maidservants came near, they and their children,
“Then the {two} maidservants came closer {to Esau} {along} with their children,” or “Then the/Jacob’s {two} servant wives and their children came/went closer/forward,” See how you translated “maidservants” in verses 1-2.

and they bowed down. 
“and they {all} bowed {to the ground} {in front of Esau/him} {to show respect}.” See how you translated “bowed down” in verse 3. (See: translate-symaction)

“My brother, I {already} have/own enough {livestock/animals}”. For some languages it is more natural to put the address “my brother” first in this quote. Some languages also have a special term for “younger brother” that fits well here. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

Let what {belongs} to you be yours.”
“Keep what you have/own for yourself.” or “{so} keep your livestock/animals for yourself.” or “{so} keep them for yourself.”


Gen 33:10 But Jacob said, “No, please. If, please, I have found favor in your eyes, then take my gift from my hand. For indeed I have seen your face, {which is} like seeing the face of God, and you have received me.

But Jacob said, 
“But Jacob responded/insisted {to him},” (See: writing-quotations)

“No, please.
“No, I beg you.” or “Please don’t refuse {my gift}.” In verses 10 and 11, Jacob speaks urgently to Esau, because in that culture if Esau accepts Jacob’s gift, he is committing himself to treat Jacob as a friend.

If, please, I have found favor in your eyes, then
“{Rather} if you are pleased with me,” or “{Rather} if you want to be gracious/kind to me, then”. See how you translated the idiom “find/gain favor in your eyes” in verse 8.

take my gift from my hand. 
“{please} accept these gifts from me.” or “{please} accept from me what I have given {you}.” (See: figs-synecdoche)

For indeed
“After all,” or “The fact is,”

I have seen your face, {which is} like seeing the face of God, and
“for me to see your face is like seeing God’s face, especially since” or “{I thought you were still angry at me, so} I was afraid of seeing/meeting you again in person, just as I would be afraid of seeing/meeting God in person, but”. In Old Testament times it was terrifying for someone to see God in person, because normally people could not see God’s face and live (Exodus 33:20). However, God had been gracious to Jacob and allowed him to live (Genesis 32:30). In the same way, it was a terrifying thing for Jacob to see Esau who had 400 men with him, but Esau was gracious to him (33:4). (See: figs-simile)

you have received me.
“you have received/welcomed me {so kindly/warmly}.” or “you {forgave me and} welcomed me!” See how you translated a different Hebrew word that means “receive” or “welcome” in Gen 32:20.
   

Gen 33:11 Please take my blessing that was brought to you, because God has been gracious to me, and because I have everything.” And he urged him, so he took {it}.

Please take my blessing that was brought to you,
“{So} please accept my gift {of livestock/animals} that my servants brought to you,” or “{So} please accept the livestock/animals from me that I sent/gave to you,” (See: figs-activepassive)

because God has been gracious to me, 
“because God has been kind/generous to me” or “because God has blessed me”

and because I have everything.”
“and has given me everything {that I need}.” or “so that I have/own all/everything {that I need/want}.”

And he urged him, 
“He/Jacob kept urging him/Esau {to accept his gift}” or “He/Jacob kept insisting {that he/Esau accept the gift/livestock/animals from him}”. Make sure it is clear in your translation who and what is being referred to at every point in this sentence. (See: writing-pronouns)

so he took {it}.
“until {finally} he/Esau accepted {it/them}.”

Gen 33:12 Then he said, “Let’s travel and go, and I will go in front of you.”

Then he said, 
“Then Esau said/suggested {to Jacob},”

“Let’s travel and go, 
“Let’s start traveling/heading {home},” 

and I will go in front of you.” 
“and I will lead/accompany/escort you.” Esau is suggesting that he would accompany or escort Jacob and his family, not that he would go far ahead of them. 


Gen 33:13 But he said to him, “My lord knows that the children {are} tender and the flock{s} and the herd{s} {that} are nursing {are} with me. And if they drive them one day, then all the flock{s} will die.

But he said to him, 
“But he/Jacob replied to him,” (See: writing-pronouns)

“My lord knows that
“Sir, you know that” or “Sir, as you know,” See how you translated “my lord” in verse 8.

the children {are} tender 
“my children {are} fragile/frail/delicate/weak”

and the flock{s} and the herd{s} {that} are nursing {are} with me.
“and some of my sheep and cattle are nursing {their young}.” or “and I need {to be careful with} {all} the sheep and cattle that are nursing {their young}.” See how you translated “flock{s} and herd{s}” in Gen 12:16.

And if they drive them one day,
“If my servants/men drive the livestock/animals {too hard/far} in one day,” or “If I force the livestock/animals to go/travel too far/fast {for} {even} one day,”

then all the flock{s} will die.
“then all the flock{s} {and herds} will die.” or “then all of them will die.” This phrase especially refers to the sheep and cattle that were nursing, but Jacob is probably using hyperbole here (“all”) to emphasize that he does not want to travel too fast. (See: figs-hyperbole)


Gen 33:14 Please let my lord go on before his servant, and I will lead them on at my gentle pace, at the pace of the livestock that {are} ahead of me and at the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.”

Please let my lord go on before his servant,
“{So then,} sir, please go on {home} ahead of me, sir.” See how you translated Jacob’s use of “my lord” (in verse 8) and “servant” (in verse 5) to show respect and deference to Esau. Here he uses both terms for emphasis. (See: figs-honorifics)

and I will lead them on at my gentle pace, at the pace of the livestock that {are} ahead of me and at the pace of the children, 
“Then/Meanwhile I will travel along slowly at a pace/speed {that is safe/good} for the livestock/animals and children that are with me,”

until I come to my lord 
“until we reach you, sir,” or “We will catch up to you later, sir,”
 
in Seir.”
“in {the land/region of} Seir.” See how you translated “the land of Seir” in Gen 32:3. The land of Seir was a mountainous region southeast of the land of Canaan (and the Dead Sea) and was where Esau had settled. It was also called “Edom” (Gen 32:3), which was Esau’s nickname (Gen 25:30). You could put some of that information in a footnote.

But he said,
“But Jacob replied,” or “Jacob said/replied {to him},” or “Jacob answered {him},” Make sure the way you translate this quote margin fits with how you translate the previous and following sentences. (See: writing-quotations)

“Why {do} that?
“There’s no need for that.” or “There is no need {for you} to do that.” Jacob uses a rhetorical question here to emphasize that there is no need for Esau to leave any of his men with him. For some languages it is clearer and more natural to use a statement here instead. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-rquestion)

Let me find favor in the eyes of my lord.” 
“{Just} please {continue to} be gracious/kind to me, sir.” or “Sir, please {just} {continue to} treat me kindly.” Consider again how you translated “my lord” in verses 8,13-15. For some languages it is more natural to put this address earlier in this quote. Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated the idiom “find favor in the eyes of” in verse 8. (See: figs-honorifics)

So on that day 
“So that {very/same} day”

Esau went on his way 
“Esau {and his men} started on their way” or “Esau {and his men} left and headed”

“back {home} to {the land/region of} Seir.” See how you translated “Seir” in verse 14.


Gen 33:17 And Jacob traveled to Succoth, and he built a house for himself, and for his livestock he made shelters. For that {reason} he called the name of the place Succoth.

And Jacob traveled to Succoth, 
“But Jacob traveled/went to {the town of} Succoth {instead}” or “Meanwhile, {instead of going to Seir,} Jacob {and his family} traveled/went to {the town of} Succoth”. Jacob went northwest to Succoth, instead of going south to the region of Seir as he had said he would do (verse 14). Also see how you translated “travel” in verse 12. (See: grammar-connect-logic-contrast)

and he built a house for himself, 
“There he {and his men/servants} built a house for himself {and his family/household},” or “where he {and his men/servants} built a house for his family/household,” Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin a new sentence here.

and for his livestock he made shelters. 
“and they {also} built {some} shelters for his livestock/animals.” or “and shelters for his livestock/animals.” The term “livestock” is general here and includes all of Jacob’s animals.

For that {reason} 
“That is why” or “Because of that,” See how you translated this phrase in Gen 32:32.

he called the name of the place Succoth.
“the name of that place/town is {called} Succoth, {which means “shelters.”}” or “they/people call that place/town Succoth, {which means “shelters.”}” The phrase “he called” could refer to Jacob, or it could refer to people in general, as in Gen 11:9; 16:14; 21:31; 25:30; 27:36; 29:34; 31:48. If you include the meaning of the name Succoth in your translation or in a footnote, make sure it matches the way you translate “shelters” earlier in this verse. (See: translate-names)

Gen 33:18 Then Jacob came {in} peace {to} the city of Shechem, which {was} in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan Aram, and he camped before the city.

Then Jacob came {in} peace {to} the city of Shechem, which {was} in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan Aram, 
“Later Jacob {and his family} arrived safely at the city of Shechem in the land/region of Canaan, as he/they continued traveling {home} from {the land/region of} Paddan Aram,” or “{After that,} Jacob {and his family} continued their journey {home} from {the land/region of} Paddan Aram, until {eventually} they arrived safely at the city of Shechem in the land/region of Canaan,” Jacob and his family had left Paddan Aram and had been traveling back to the land of his ancestors in Canaan (Gen 31:3, 13, 18).

One of Hamor’s sons was named Shechem.” or “for/with one hundred pieces {of silver/money} from the sons of Hamor {who was} the father of Shechem.” The weight and value of a hundred kesitahs of silver is not known. Some ancient translations (including the LXX and Latin Vulgate) have “a hundred lambs” here, but most modern translations have “a hundred pieces of silver/money”. (See: translate-unknown)

and he called it El Elohe Israel.
“and he named it El Elohe Israel, {which means “God is the God of Israel.”}” The name “El Elohe Israel” could also mean “Powerful/Mighty is the God of Israel” because the Hebrew word “el” can mean “God” or “powerful”. You could put that information in a footnote. (See: translate-names)

34:1-31 Shechem Rapes Dinah, And Jacob’s Sons Take Revenge

Gen 34:1 Then Dinah, the daughter of Leah, whom she had born for Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land. 

Then Dinah, 
“Then/Now {one day} Dinah,” or “{One day,} Dinah,” These events took place at an unspecified time after Jacob and his family set up their camp beside the city of Shechem (Gen 33:18). Consider what is the best way to introduce a new event in your language. Also be consistent here with how you spelled “Dinah” in Gen 30:21. (See: writing-newevent)

the daughter of Leah, whom she had born for Jacob, 
“{who was} the daughter whom Leah bore/had for Jacob,” or “{who was} the daughter of Jacob and Leah,”

went out to see
“went {to/into the city} to visit {with}”. The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. The verb “to see”: 1. could be used here as an idiom that means “to visit”; many languages have a similar idiom; or 2. could literally mean that Dinah went “to see/observe” the local women, for example, how they dressed and what jewelry they wore. (See: figs-idiom)

the daughters of the land.
“{some of} the women who were native to that area/region.” or “{some of} the local/native women.” See how you translated “daughters of the land” in Gen 27:46, and how you translated a similar phrase (“people of the land”) in Gen 23:7, 12.


Gen 34:2 And Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite, the ruler of the land, saw her, and he took her and lay with her and violated her.

And Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite, the ruler of the land, 
“Then Shechem, who was the/a son of the Hivite named Hamor who ruled that region,” or “Now the ruler/chief of that region was a Hivite named Hamor. His son Shechem”. Consider which order of phrases is best here in your language. Also see how you translated “Hivites” in Gen 10:17 and “ruler” in Gen 25:16. (See: figs-infostructure)

saw her, and he took her
“saw Dinah, and he grabbed {hold of} her” or “saw {how beautiful} Dinah was, so he took/grabbed {hold of} her”

and lay with her and violated her. 
“and forced her to go to bed with him.” or “and raped her.” This is a euphemistic way of saying that Shechem forced Dinah to have sex with him. Translate this in a way that will not offend or embarrass people, especially when hearing your translation read aloud. (See: figs-euphemism)


Gen 34:3 And his soul was attached to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the young woman and spoke to the heart of the young woman. 

And his soul was attached to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and
“He/Shechem was strongly/deeply attracted to Jacob’s daughter Dinah and” or “He/Shechem admired Jacob’s daughter Dinah so much that” or “He/Shechem admired her so much that”

he loved the young woman 
“he loved her” or “he fell in love with her”

and spoke to the heart of the young woman.
“and spoke sweetly/tenderly to her {to try to woo/persuade/comfort her}.” or “and {tried to win her heart/affection} by speaking tenderly/kindly to her.” See how you translated “young woman” in Gen 24:14, and see the note about that there.


Gen 34:4 Then Shechem said to Hamor his father, saying, “Get this girl for me as a wife.”

Then Shechem said to Hamor his father, saying, 
“Then Shechem said to his father Hamor,” or “Then Shechem {went to} his father Hamor and requested/demanded,”

“Get this girl for me as a wife.”
“Negotiate {things} for me so that I can marry this girl.” or “Ask this girl’s family to let me marry her.” At that time it was normal for parents to negotiate with another family to get a spouse for their child. The negotiations would include a bride-price and other details. You could put some of that information in a footnote. The term “girl” that Shechem uses here is less respectful than the term “young woman” that is used in verses 3 and 12.

Gen 34:5 Then Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter, and his sons were with his livestock in the fields, so Jacob kept quiet until they came. 

Then Jacob heard that 
“When Jacob found out that” or “When Jacob was told/informed {by someone} that”

he had defiled Dinah his daughter, and 
“Shechem had dishonored/disgraced his daughter Dinah,” or “his daughter Dinah had been defiled/disgraced by Shechem,”

his sons were with his livestock in the fields, 
“his sons were {still} tending his livestock/animals out in the fields,” or “his sons were {still} {out} in the fields taking care of his livestock/animals,”

so Jacob kept quiet 
“so he didn’t say anything {about it}” or “so he didn’t tell anyone {about it}”. Make sure your translation of this phrase does not mean that Jacob was totally silent. Rather, it means he did not speak about what Shechem had done to Dinah.

“until they came {back} {home}.” or “until they returned {home}.”


Gen 34:6 And Hamor the father of Shechem came out to Jacob to talk with him. 

And Hamor the father of Shechem came out
“Meanwhile, Shechem’s father Hamor went {with his son}” or “Meanwhile, {Shechem and} Shechem’s/his father Hamor went”. For some languages it is more natural to introduce Shechem here, rather than wait and have him appear too suddenly in verse 11. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-explicit)

“to talk to Jacob.” or “to Jacob’s {camp/tent} to talk with/to him.”


Gen 34:7 Then the sons of Jacob came from the fields. When they heard, then the men were grieved and it burned within them greatly, because he had done something disgraceful to Israel by lying with the daughter of Jacob, and such a thing should not have been done! 

Then the sons of Jacob came from the fields. 
“Then/Soon Jacob’s sons returned {home} from the fields.”

When they heard, then 
“When they heard {what had happened},” or “When they heard {that Shechem had raped their sister},” Many translations put “when they heard” with the previous sentence. However, unless someone else told Jacob’s sons the news of what happened, that interpretation contradicts verse 5, which says that Jacob kept quiet about it until his sons got home.

the men were grieved
“they were {very} distressed/shocked”. See how you translated “grieved” in Gen 6:6. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.

and it burned within them greatly, 
“and filled with anger,” or “and extremely angry,” See how you translated the idiom “it/anger burned within...” in Gen 32:36. (See: figs-idiom)

because he had done something disgraceful to Israel 
“because Shechem had disgraced/dishonored {the people/family of} Israel” or “because Shechem had brought shame on Israel’s family”. Notice that the Hebrew text has both of Jacob’s names in verse 7, “Jacob” and “Israel”, to emphasize that Shechem had sinned against Jacob and all of his descendants (the people of Israel). You could put that information in a footnote. Make sure that your translation of “Israel” does not refer here to a place, since Israel was not yet a country or a territory.

by lying with the daughter of Jacob,
“by having sexual relations with Jacob’s daughter.” or “by raping Jacob’s daughter.”

and such a thing should not have been done!
“Such a {wicked/terrible} thing should never be done {by anyone}!” or “No one should ever do such a {wicked/horrible} thing/crime!”


Gen 34:8 But Hamor spoke with them, saying, “Shechem my son, his soul is attached to your daughter. Please give her to him as a wife.

But Hamor spoke with them, saying, 
“But Hamor pleaded with Jacob and his sons and said,” or “But Hamor urged/begged Jacob and his sons,”

“Shechem my son, his soul is attached to 
“My son Shechem really/deeply loves” or “My son Shechem has fallen {deeply/completely} in love with”
 
your daughter.
“your {family’s} daughter.” or “your daughter {and sister}.” The pronoun “your” is plural here which shows that Hamor is addressing not only Jacob but also his sons. (See: figs-yousingular)

Please give her to him as a wife.
“{So} please allow/permit him to marry her.” The way “give” and “take” are used in verses 8, 9, 12, 16 and 21 reflects the culture at that time, when parents or families arranged marriages for their daughters. Also see the note about this at verse 4.
 

Gen 34:9 And intermarry with us: give your daughters to us and take our daughters for yourselves 

And intermarry with us: 
“{In fact,} let’s allow marriage between our two people groups,” or “Let’s agree to let members of our families marry one another,”

give your daughters to us and take our daughters for yourselves
“{so that} your daughters can/will marry our {young men} and your {young men} can/will marry our daughters.” or “{so that} you allow our {young men} to marry your daughters and we allow your {young men} to marry our daughters.”


Gen 34:10 and settle with us. And the land is before you. Settle and trade in it, and acquire {property} in it.”

and settle with us. 
“You can {also} settle/live among us.” or “{We also invite you to} settle/live with/among us.”

And the land is before you. Settle and trade in it, 
“The land is available for you {to choose what you want}; settle/live {in it} {wherever you want}. You can {also} trade {freely} here,” or “You can settle/live {wherever you want} in the land. You can also do business buying and selling things {wherever you want},” Normally foreigners were not allowed to own land or to move around in the land to trade freely. So that is why Hamor is offering this in exchange for Jacob allowing his family to intermarry with the Hivites.

and acquire {property} in it.”
“and you can buy/own {your own} {property/land}.”

Increase greatly the dowry and gift for me, 
“Set the dowry/bride-price and {marriage/wedding} gifts {that I must pay} {to marry her} as high as you want,” The “dowry” was the payment that a groom (and his family) had to give to the bride’s family, which could include things like money, land and livestock. The term “gift” probably refers to additional gifts given to the bride and her family members (as in Gen 24:53). If the custom of paying a dowry is not known in your culture, you could include an explanation in a footnote. (See: translate-unknown)

and I will give according to what you say to me. 
“and I will give/pay {you} whatever you request/ask/require from me.” See how you translated a similar clause in verse 11.

Then give the young woman to me as a wife.”

“We are not able to do such a thing as” or “It would be not be acceptable/right for us to”

give our sister to a man who has a foreskin,
“let our sister marry a man {like you} who has not had his foreskin removed” or “allow a man {like you} who is not circumcised to marry our sister”. Translate “who has a foreskin” in a way that will not offend or embarrass people, especially when hearing your translation read aloud. (See: figs-euphemism)

Then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters for us. 
“Then we will let our daughters marry your {young men}, and our {young men} will marry your daughters.” or “{If/After you do that,} then we will allow your {young men} to marry our daughters, and {we will allow} your daughters to marry our {young men}.” The pronouns “we”, “our” and “us” are exclusive in verses 14-17, except at the end of verse 16 below. Also see how you translated “give...daughters...take...daughters...” in verse 9. (See: figs-exclusive)

“then we will take our {father’s/family’s} daughter {from you} and go/move {somewhere else}.” or “then we will leave and take our sister with us.” The phrase “our daughter” reflects the fact that Jacob’s sons are using their father’s perspective and authority here. If that is confusing, you could say “our sister” instead. See how you translated “our {family’s} daughter” in verse 8.

Gen 34:18 And their words were good in the eyes of Hamor and in the eyes of Shechem, Hamor’s son.

And their words were good in the eyes of Hamor and in the eyes of Shechem, Hamor’s son.
“What Jacob’s sons said/proposed seemed good to Hamor and his son Shechem.” or “Hamor and his son Shechem were pleased {and agreed to do} what Jacob’s sons said/proposed.” See how you translated the idiom “good in...eyes” in Gen 19:8. It may need to be translated differently, depending on the context. (See: figs-idiom)


Gen 34:19 So the young man did not delay to do the thing, because he was delighted with the daughter of Jacob and he was honored more than all of the house of his father.

So the young man did not delay 
“So Shechem immediately started” or “So right away Shechem took action”

to do the thing,
“to do/fulfill what they required/proposed,” or “to do/fulfill their requirement,”

because he was delighted with the daughter of Jacob 
“because he was thrilled with Jacob’s daughter {Dinah}.” or “because he was deeply/completely in love with Jacob’s daughter {Dinah}.”

and he was honored more than all of the house of his father. 
“{He was able to get people/everyone to do what he wanted} because he was the most respected person in his father’s household/family.” For some languages it is more natural to put this clause earlier in this sentence and say, “So right away Shechem, who was the most respected member in his father’s household/family, started to do what they required, because he was thrilled with Jacob’s daughter.” (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 34:20 So Hamor and Shechem his son went to the gate of their city, and they spoke to the men of their city, saying,

So Hamor and Shechem his son 
“In fact, he/Shechem and his father Hamor”

went to the gate of their city, 
“went {straight/directly} to their city’s gates/entrance {for a town meeting},”

and they spoke to the men of their city, saying, 
“and they spoke to the city elders/leaders {who had gathered there}. They said,” or “and they told the elders/leaders of their city {about Jacob and his sons},” In that culture the leaders of a city held their meetings at the main city gates (as in Gen 23:3). Cities were surrounded by walls (that had gates) for protection. You could put some of that information in a footnote so that people understand what was happening.
 

Gen 34:21 ”These men {are} peaceful with us, so let them settle in the land and let them trade in it. And behold, the land {is} broad of hands before them. We can take their daughters for ourselves as wives, and we can give our daughters to them. 

“These men {are} peaceful with us, 
“These people are friendly toward us,” or “Jacob and his family are at peace with us,” Here “us” includes Hamor, Shechem and the men they are talking to. (See: figs-exclusive)

so let them
“so {let’s} allow them to” or “so we should let them”

settle in the land
“live/stay in the/our land”. See how you translated “settle” in verse 10.

and let them trade in it. 
“and trade {freely} here.” or “and let them buy and sell things {wherever they want}.” See how you translated “trade in it” in verse 10.

And behold, the land {is} broad of hands before them. 
“Look, there is enough land to support them {and us}.” or “After all, there is more than enough space/room in the/this land for them {too}.”

We can take their daughters for ourselves as wives, and we can give our daughters to them.
“{That way too,} we can take/choose their daughters to be {our} wives, and we can let their {young} men marry our daughters.” or “{Besides that,} {then} our {young men} can marry their daughters, and their {young men} can marry our daughters.” See how you translated similar clauses in verses 9 and 16. It may be necessary to translate these in different ways, depending on the context.
   

Gen 34:22 Only on this {condition} will the men consent with us to settle with us, to become one people: when every male among us is circumcised just as they are circumcised. 

Only on this {condition} will the men consent with us to settle with us, 
“There is just one thing/condition/requirement: They will only agree to settle/live among us”. or “But they will only consent/agree to settle/live among us”. See how you began verse 15, which is very similar to verse 22.

to become one people: 
“and become one people group {with us}”. See how you translated this phrase in verse 16.

when every male among us is circumcised 
“if all our males are circumcised” or “if we circumcise all our males”. See how you translated “every male among...circumcised” in verse 15.

just as they are circumcised.
“as their males are.” or “so that we are like them.”


Gen 34:23 Their livestock and their property and all their animals, will they not {belong} to us? Only let us consent with them, and they will settle with us!”

Their livestock and their property and all their animals, 
“{Then} all their livestock and animals, and {all} their {other} property/possessions” or “{But if we do that,} {all} their property/possessions, {including} their livestock and all their {other} animals” 

will they not {belong} to us? 
“will belong to us!” or “will be ours!” This rhetorical question emphasizes that all of Jacob’s livestock and property will belong to the people of Shechem. If a rhetorical question does not fit here in your language, you could make this a statement. (See: figs-rquestion)

Only let us consent with them, 
“{So} let’s just agree to do what they require,” or “{So} we should just do what they propose/require”

and they will settle with us!”
“so that they will settle/live among us!” See how you translated “settle with us” in verses 10 and 22.

Gen 34:24 And all who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor and to Shechem his son, and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.

And all who went out of the gate of his city 
“All {the men} who were citizens/leaders/elders of the city” or “All the men/leaders/elders who were {there} at the city gate/entrance”. Make sure that your translation of this idiom refers here to the same men who had gathered at the city gates in verse 20. (See: figs-idiom)

listened to Hamor and to Shechem his son, 
“agreed with Hamor and his son Shechem,” or “agreed to do what Hamor and his son Shechem said,”

and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.
“so all of them and all the other males in the city were circumcised.” or “so they circumcised every male in the city, including themselves.”

Gen 34:25 Then it happened on the third day, when they were in pain, then two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, brothers of Dinah, each took his sword and went upon the city boldly and killed every male.

Then it happened on the third day, 
“On the third day {after that},” or “Three days later,”

when they were in pain, 
“when the men of {the city of} Shechem were {all} {still} sore {from being circumcised},” or “when it was {still} painful for the men of the city {to move/walk},”

then two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, brothers of Dinah, 
“two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, {who were} Dinah’s brothers,” These brothers had the same father and mother as Dinah. Some languages have a special term for this. Do what is best in your language. (See: translate-kinship)

each took his sword and went upon the city boldly 
“both took their swords and attacked the city, with no one opposing/resisting them.” See how you translated “sword” in Gen 27:40.

and killed every male.
“They killed all the males/men {there}”. The children who were males were probably not killed, since later (verse 29) it says that all the children were captured. Also, consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here that continues into verse 26.


Gen 34:26 And they killed Hamor and Shechem his son with the mouth of the sword, and they took Dinah from the house of Shechem and left. 

And they killed Hamor and Shechem his son with the mouth of the sword, 
“with their swords, including Hamor and his son Shechem.” Some languages have dual pronouns for “they” and “you” that can be used in verses 25-26 and 30-31 to refer to Simeon and Levi. (See: figs-youdual)

and they took Dinah from the house of Shechem 
“Then they took/got/rescued Dinah from Shechem’s house”

and left.
“and left {the city}.” or “and returned {home}.”


Gen 34:27 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister. 

The sons of Jacob came upon the slain and plundered the city, 
“{Then/Next} {all} Jacob’s sons went {into the city} and took everything valuable from/off the dead bodies and from {the rest of} the city”. All of Jacob’s sons probably joined Simeon and Levi in plundering the city, after those two had killed all the men there (verse 25).

because they had defiled their sister.
“{They did that} because {that was where} Shechem had defiled/dishonored/disgraced their sister.” or “to get revenge for the shameful thing that had been done to their sister {there}.” See how you translated “defiled” in verses 5 and 13. Even though Shechem was the one who actually defiled Dinah (verses 2, 5, 7, 13), Jacob’s sons held everyone in the city responsible for the crime that their ruler’s son had committed (verses 25-29). If that is not clear, you could put that information in a footnote. Make sure that your translation of “they” does not refer to Jacob’s sons.

Gen 34:28 They took their flock{s} and their herd{s} and their donkeys, and what {was} in the city and what {was} in the field{s}.
They took their flock{s} and their herd{s} and their donkeys, and what {was} in the city and what {was} in the field{s}.
“They took away the people’s sheep and goats, their cattle, their donkeys, and everything else {they wanted} from inside the city and from out in the fields/countryside.” or “They plundered whatever was inside the city and out in the {surrounding} fields/area, including the people’s flocks {of sheep and goats}, their herds {of cattle} and their donkeys.” See how you translated “donkeys” in Gen 32:15. (See: figs-infostructure)

And all their wealth and all their little ones and their women they took captive, and they also plundered everything that was in the houses.
“They carried away all the valuable things the people of Shechem had owned, including everything that was in their houses. They also captured all their women and children.” or “They took away everything that was valuable, and also captured all the children and women. They seized and took away everything that was in the houses.” See how you translated “plundered” in verse 27.

Gen 34:30 Then Jacob said to Simeon and to Levi, “You have brought trouble on me by making me stink among {those} who live in the land, among the Canaanites and among the Perizzites! I am few of number, and if they gather together against me and attack me, then I will be destroyed, I and my house!” 

Then Jacob 
“Later/Afterwards {when they came home,} Jacob”

said to Simeon and to Levi,
“scolded/rebuked Simeon and Levi {by saying},”

“You have brought trouble on me 
“You have brought/caused me {serious} trouble/problems” or “You have put me/us in great danger” 

by making me stink among {those} who live in the land, among the Canaanites and among the Perizzites!
“by causing the people who live in this land to despise/hate me/us, {including/especially} the Canaanites and Perizzites!” or “by causing the Canaanites and Perizzites who live in this land to despise/hate me/us!” The idiom “making me stink” means Jacob’s sons had caused him to have a very bad reputation so that people would hate him and his family. Some languages have a similar idiom that fits well here. Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated “the Canaanites” and “the Perizzites” in Gen 13:7; 15:20-21. There were other people groups also living in the land, but these two groups are the ones being emphasized here. (See: figs-idiom) 

I am few of number,
“I/We {only} have a few men {to defend us},” or “I/We don’t have many people {in our family/household},” The words “I”, “me” and “my” refer in this verse to all of Jacob’s family; he uses these pronouns because he is the leader of his family. (See: figs-synecdoche)

and if they gather together against me and attack me,
“so if they {all} join {forces} against me/us and attack me/us,” Make sure your use of the pronouns “me” or “us” fits with the way you translate the rest of this sentence.

“then I/we and my/our family/household will be destroyed/killed!” or “they will destroy/annihilate/kill me/us and {the rest of} my/our family/household!”


Gen 34:31 But they said, “Should he have treated our sister like a prostitute?”

But they said,
“But Simeon and Levi responded/replied {angrily},”

“Should he have treated our sister
“He/Shechem should not have treated our sister” or “We couldn’t let him/Shechem {just} get away with treating our sister”. This rhetorical question shows Simeon and Levi’s anger and emphasizes that Shechem was wrong to do what he did and implies that he (and his city) deserved justice. (See: figs-rquestion)

like a prostitute?”
“like/as a prostitute/whore!” or “like/as a {cheap,} immoral woman!”. Some languages have an idiom for this. Do what is best in your language.

35:1-15 God Blesses Jacob At {The Town Of} Bethel

Gen 35:1 Then God said to Jacob, “Get up, go up to Bethel and settle there, and make an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you were fleeing from the presence of Esau your brother.”

Then God said to Jacob,
“Then God told/commanded Jacob,” Translate this quote margin in a way that is natural in your language and that fits with what God says. (See: writing-quotations)

“Get up, 
“Get ready/packed” or “Leave here”

go up to Bethel and settle there,
“and travel to {the town of} Bethel and live there.” or “and move to {the town of} Bethel.” The verb “go up” reflects the fact that the town of Bethel is higher in elevation than the city of Shechem; it does not refer to the direction they were going, which was south. Many translations leave “up” implied (to prevent confusion). Do what is best in your language.

and make an altar there 
“Build an altar there {and offer sacrifices on it}”. See how you translated “altar” in Gen 33:20. (See: figs-explicit)

to the God 
“to {me as} the God” or “to {me,} the God”. Make sure it is clear in your translation that God is referring to himself as he speaks here to Jacob. (See: figs-explicit)

who appeared to you
“who appeared/came to you {there}” or “who introduced himself/myself to you {there}”. See how you translated “appeared” in Gen 26:2, 24.

when you were fleeing 
“when you were running away”. See how you translated “flee” in Gen 31:20-21, 27.

from the presence of Esau your brother.”
“from {the anger of} your brother Esau.” or “from your brother Esau.”


Gen 35:2 So Jacob said to his household and to all who {were} with him, “Remove the foreign gods that {are} among you, and purify yourselves and change your clothes. 

So Jacob said to his household 
“So Jacob told {the members of} his household/family”

and to all who {were} with him, 
“and everyone {else} who {was} with him,” This included Jacob’s servants and the people (women and children) whom his sons had just captured from the city of Shechem (Gen 34:29). You could put some of that information in a footnote.

“Remove the foreign gods that {are} among you,
“Get rid of the idols you have that other/pagan people/ethnic groups worship.” or “Give up the idols that you got/have from foreigners”. See how you translated “idols” and “gods” in Gen 31:19, 30, 32. (See: translate-key-terms)

and purify yourselves 
“and cleanse yourselves” or “Also wash and make yourselves clean”. They were to make themselves physically clean as a sign that they were preparing themselves mentally and spiritually to worship God (as their only God) at Bethel, which was a holy place where God had met with Jacob before. Some languages may have a special word for “purify” that communicates this. Do what is best in your language. Also consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin a new sentence here. (See: translate-key-terms)

and change your clothes.
“and put/get on clean clothes.”


Gen 35:3 Then let us get up and go up to Bethel, and there I will make an altar to God who answered me in the day of my distress. And he has been with me in the way that I have gone.” 

Then let us get up 
“Then we will/must pack up {our things/belongings}” or “Then we will/must leave here”. See how you translated “get up” in verse 1.

and go up to Bethel, 
“and go/move to {the town of} Bethel”. See how you translated “go up” in verse 1.

and there I will make an altar to God 
“where I/we will build an altar to worship God” or “There I/we will build an altar and worship God”. The Hebrew text has “I” here, but probably also implies that others in Jacob’s household would help him build the altar. Consider whether or not it is best to begin a new sentence here in your language. Also see how you translated “make an altar” in verse 1.

who answered me
“because he answered/helped me” or “who answered/granted my prayers {for help}”

in the day of my distress.
“during the days/time/times when I was in distress/trouble.” The phrase “In the day of” is used here as an idiom that could refer to the time when Jacob was fleeing from Esau, or it could be more general and also include other times when Jacob was suffering, such as the years he worked for Laban. (See: figs-idiom)

And he has been with me
“He has {always} been/stayed with me/us {and taken care of me/us}”. See how you translated the idiom “with me” in Gen 31:5, where it also means that God is not only present with him but also helps him and takes care of him. (See: figs-idiom)

in the way that I have gone.”
“everywhere that I/we have gone/traveled.”


Gen 35:4 So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods that {were} in their hand and the rings that {were} in their ears, and Jacob hid them under the terebinth tree that {was} by Shechem.

So they gave to Jacob 
“So/Then they gave Jacob” or “So/Then they handed/turned over to Jacob”

all the foreign gods that {were} in their hand
“all the foreign/pagan gods/idols that they had {with them}” or “all their idols”. See how you translated “foreign gods” in verse 2. You could translate this differently here since this is the second time they are mentioned in this paragraph. 

and the rings that {were} in their ears, 
“and the earrings they wore on their ears.” or “and {all} their earrings.” These earrings seem to have been part of their idol worship and may have had images of their idols on them. You could include that information in a footnote.

and Jacob hid them 
“Then Jacob hid/buried everything {in the ground}” or “Then Jacob hid/buried all those things {in the ground}”

under 
“beside” or “at the foot/base of”. Make sure it is clear in your translation that Jacob buried these things in the ground beside the tree, not directly under the trunk of the tree.

the terebinth tree
“the/a terebinth/oak tree”. Although this phrase refers to a terebinth tree, many translations have “oak tree” instead, or some other type of large, strong tree that is well known. See how you translated a different Hebrew word that is also translated “terebinth tree” or “oak tree” in Gen 12:6; 13:18; 14:13; 18:1. Another Hebrew word in Gen 35:8 is also translated as “oak”. (See: translate-unknown)

and the dread of God was on the cities that {were} around them, so that
“and God caused {the people in} the surrounding/nearby cities/towns to be terrified/afraid, so that” or “and God made {the people in} the nearby cities/towns so afraid that”. The Hebrew word “Elohim” probably means “God” in this phrase (as it usually does in the Bible); most English versions translate it that way here. Or it could be an adjective that modifies “dread/terror” and means “great/deep dread/terror” (similar to Gen 23:6, 30:8). See how you translated “dread” in Gen 9:2.

they did not pursue after
“they did not attack” or “no one attacked” or “none of them chased/came/went after”. Make sure your translation of “they” refers here to the people in the surrounding towns, not Jacob’s sons.

the sons of Jacob.
“Jacob’s sons/family {to avenge the people of Shechem}.” or “them.” or “Jacob and his family.” Jacob’s sons are mentioned here since they are in focus as the ones who just plundered the city of Shechem; Jacob and the rest of his family were there with his sons and were also in danger. (See: figs-metonymy)


Gen 35:6 Then Jacob came to Luz, which {is} Bethel, which {is} in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who {were} with him. 

Then Jacob came to Luz,

which {is} Bethel, 
“which {is also/now called/named} Bethel,” or “that {is}, Bethel,” or “which {also/now has the name} Bethel,” See how you translated “which is” in Gen 23:2, 19.

which {is} in the land of Canaan,
“which is {also} in Canaan,” Since Shechem (verse 4) and Bethel were both in the land or region of Canaan, for some languages it is clearer or more natural to put this location phrase earlier in the verse and say, “Jacob/He and his family {continued traveling} in the land/region of Canaan and arrived at {the town of} Luz, which {also/now has the name} Bethel,” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

he and all the people who {were} with him.

Gen 35:7 And there he built an altar, and he called the place El Bethel, because there God had revealed himself to him when he was fleeing from the presence of his brother.

And there he built an altar, 
“There he/Jacob built an altar,” or “Then he/Jacob built an altar there,” Consider again how you translated “altar” throughout the book of Genesis. See Gen 8:20; 12:7-8; 13:4,18; 22:9; 26:25; 33:20; 35:1, 3, 7. (See: translate-key-terms)

and he called the place 
“and he named the/that place” or “and he called/named it”

El Bethel, 
“El Bethel, {which means “the God of/at Bethel,”}” or “El Bethel, {which means “the God of/at God’s house,”}” (See: translate-names)

because there 
“because that is where” or “because it was at Bethel that”

God had revealed himself to him
“God had {first} introduced himself to him/Jacob” or “God had {first} appeared to him/Jacob”. Compare how you translated a different Hebrew word that has a similar meaning (“appeared”) in verses 1 and 9.

when he was fleeing 
“when/while he was running away”. See how you translated “fleeing” in verse 1.

from the presence of his brother.
“from {the anger of} his brother.” or “from his brother.” See how you translated “from the presence of” in verse 1.

Gen 35:8 Then Deborah, the nurse of Rebekah, died and was buried below Bethel, under the oak tree. So he called its name Allon Bacuth.

Then Deborah, the nurse of Rebekah, died 
“Then {while they were still in Bethel,} Rebekah’s {former} nurse/nanny Deborah died” or “{While they were there,} Deborah died. She was the servant who had helped raise {Jacob’s mother} Rebekah {when she was young}.” See how you translated “nurse” in Gen 24:59. 

and was buried 
“and {her body} was buried {by Jacob} {in the ground}” or “They/Jacob buried her {body} {in the ground}”

below Bethel, 
“{in the valley} below/near {the town of} Bethel,” or “{at a place} south of {the town of} Bethel,” The town of Bethel was built on a hill, so the phrase “below Bethel” means that Deborah was buried near Bethel, in a valley or place that was lower in elevation than the town, and possibly to the south of it.

under the oak tree. 
“beside the/an oak tree” or “at the foot/base of an oak tree.” See how you translated a similar phrase (“under the terebinth/oak tree”) in verse 4. Many translations translate this phrase the same way in both places (“under an oak tree”), even though different Hebrew words are used for the type of tree. Also, for some languages it is more natural to put this phrase before the previous phrase and say, “at the base of an oak tree, below/near {the town of} Bethel.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

So he called its name
“So he/they named the tree/place” or “That is why the/that place is known as”. The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can: (1) be an idiom that means people in general call the tree or place Allon Bacuth. (2) literally refer to Jacob as the one who named the place. See how you translated a similar clause in Gen 31:38. 

Allon Bacuth.
“Allon Bacuth, {which means “oak tree of weeping/mourning.”}” or “Allon Bacuth, {which means “oak tree where people mourn.”}” If you include the meaning of this name in your translation or in a footnote, make sure it fits with how you translated “oak tree” in the previous sentence.

and God said to him, 
“and said to him,” or “by saying to him,” What God says to Jacob in verses 10-12 is the blessing. So make sure your translation of “blessed” (verse 9) and “said” (verse 10) refers to the same event, not two separate events. See how you translated “blessed...and said” in Gen 1:28. (See: writing-quotations)

“Your name {is} Jacob,
“{Although} your name {has been} Jacob,” Make sure your translation of this clause does not sound like God was telling Jacob something he did not know.

your name will not be called Jacob anymore, 
“that will no longer be your name,” or “it will no longer be Jacob/that,” Notice that Jacob is referred to by both of his names in this chapter (“Jacob” in verses 11-20, 22-29; “Israel” in verses 10 and 21). You could put that information in a footnote. Also see how you translated this clause in Gen 32:28, and see the note about Jacob’s names there.

but Israel will be your name!”
“rather your name will be Israel!” or “but {rather} you will have the name Israel!”

So he called his name Israel.
“So {once again} God gave Jacob the name Israel.” This was not the first time God had given Jacob the name Israel (see Gen 32:28). To make that clear, you could make “once again” explicit here. (See: figs-explicit)

“I {am} God Almighty. 
“I {am} Almighty God.” or “I {am} God {who is} all-powerful.” See how you translated the title “God Almighty” in Gen 17:1 and 28:3.

Be fruitful 
“Have many children”. Consider again how you translated “Be fruitful and multiply” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 1:22, 28; 8:17; 9:1, 7; 35:11. It may be necessary to translate this phrase in different ways, depending on the context.

“and increase {in number}.” or “so that you {and your descendants} become {very} numerous/many.”

A nation and a community of nations will be from you, 
“{Your descendants will become} a {large} people/ethnic group, in fact, many people/ethnic groups will come/descend from you,” or “Your descendants will become many people/ethnic groups,” Compare how you translated a similar phrase (“a multitude of nations”) in Gen 17:4-5 and another similar phrase (“a community of peoples”) in Gen 28:3.

and kings will come from your loins.
“and kings will come/descend from you.” or “and some of your descendants will be kings.” The phrase “come from your loins” is an idiom that refers to having children, grandchildren and other descendants. Consider whether you have a similar idiom in your language. (See: figs-euphemism)


Gen 35:12 And the land that I gave to Abraham and to Isaac I will give to you, and I will give the land to your descendants after you.”

And the land that I gave to Abraham and to Isaac I will give to you, and I will give the land to your descendants after you.”
“{Besides that,} the land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I {also} give to you and your descendants {who live} after you.” or “Also, I am giving to you the land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac, and I will {also} give it to your descendants {who live} after you.”


Gen 35:13 Then God went up from him at the place where he spoke with him.

Then God went up from him at the place where he spoke with him.

Gen 35:14 Then Jacob set up a pillar at the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone, and he poured a drink offering on it, and he poured oil on it. 

Then Jacob set up a pillar 
“Then Jacob set/stood a {large} stone up {on its end}” or “Then Jacob took/chose a {large} stone {that was there} and set/stood it up {on its end}”. See how you translated a similar passage in Gen 28:18.

at the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone, 
“at the place where God had spoken/talked to him, to mark the place {as special}” or “as a memorial stone to remember the place where God had spoken/talked to him”

and he poured a drink offering on it, and he poured oil on it.
“Then he poured some wine and some {olive} oil on it {to thank God and dedicate the place to him}.” A drink offering was probably wine that Jacob poured on the stone as a sacrifice to God, to worship and thank him. See how you translated “poured oil on...” in Gen 28:18. (See: translate-symaction)


Gen 35:15 And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him Bethel. 

And Jacob called the name of the place where God spoke with him Bethel.

35:16-20 Rachel Dies Giving Birth To Benjamin
 
Gen 35:16 Then they set out from Bethel, and there was still a distance of land to come to Ephrath, then Rachel started giving birth but was having great difficulty while she was giving birth.

Then they set out from Bethel, 
“Then they left {the town of} Bethel” or “Later Jacob and his family moved on from {the town of} Bethel”. Be consistent here with how you spelled “Bethel” throughout the book of Genesis, and whether you refer to it as a town or a city. See Gen 12:8; 13:3; 28:19; 31:13; 35:1, 3, 7, 15, 16.

and there was still a distance of land to come to Ephrath, 
“and started {heading} toward {the town of} Ephrath. But while they were still a distance away from there,” or “and headed for {the town of} Ephrath. While they were still some distance from there,” The phrase “a distance of land” is very general, but your translation should not make it sound like the distance was too far, because Rachel’s grave is about two kilometers (one mile) from Ephrath (Bethlehem). (See: figs-infostructure)

then Rachel started giving birth 
“{Jacob’s/his wife} Rachel, {who was pregnant,} began to have labor pains” or “Rachel went into labor”

but was having great difficulty while she was giving birth.
“but she was having a very difficult time delivering the baby.” or “but/and was experiencing great difficulty.” or “and was having severe childbirth pains.”


Gen 35:17 And it happened when she was in hard labor, then the midwife said to her, “Do not be afraid, because this {is} also a son for you!” 

And it happened when she was in hard labor,
“Then when her labor pain was at its worst,” or “Then when she was at the most difficult/painful point/time in her labor,” or “Then when her labor/childbirth pains were the most severe,” The phrase “hard labor” refers to when childbirth contractions are close together and very painful, often right before a baby is born.

then the midwife 
“{the baby was born and} the midwife/woman who was helping her deliver” 

said to her,
“exclaimed to her,” or “told her,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Do not be afraid,
“Do not worry/despair!”

because this {is} also a son for you!”
“You {now} have another son/boy!” or “You {just} gave birth to another son/boy!


Gen 35:18 Then it happened as her soul was leaving {her}—for she was dying, then she called his name Ben-oni, but his father called him Benjamin.

Then it happened as her soul was leaving {her}—for she was dying,
“But Rachel was dying, and as her soul/spirit was leaving her body,” or “But {in fact/reality,} Rachel was about to die, and just/right before her soul/spirit left her,” Some translations use an idiom here, for example, “as she was taking her last breath” or “as her life was slipping/fading away”, but it is best to translate this in a way that preserves the Biblical teaching that at death the soul or spirit leaves the body.

then she called his name Ben-oni,
“she named her baby {boy} Benoni, {which means “son of my sorrow/trouble.”}” The meaning of this name could imply that the child caused Rachel’s death. In the Hebrew text this name is two words connected with a dash (“Ben-oni”). Many translations write it that way, or as one word (“Benoni”), and a few translations write it as “Ben Oni”. Any of these spellings is fine. (See: translate-names)

but his father 
“But {later,} his father {Jacob}”. Make sure it is clear in your translation that this phrase refers to Jacob. Also, consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. (See: figs-explicit)

called him Benjamin.
“named him Benjamin {instead}.” or “changed his name to Benjamin, {which means “son of my right hand.”}” The phrase “son of my right hand” is an idiom that means “favored son” or “son of strength”. (See: translate-names)

So Rachel died and was buried 
“After Rachel died, her body was buried {by Jacob}” or “After Rachel died, they/Jacob buried her {body}”. See how you translated “was buried” in verse 8. (See: figs-activepassive)

on the way to Ephrath, 
“beside/near the road {that goes} to {the town of} Ephrath,”

Gen 35:20 And Jacob set up a pillar over her grave; that {is} the pillar of Rachel’s grave to this day.

And Jacob set up a pillar 
“Jacob set/stood a {large} stone up {on its end}”. See how you translated this clause in verse 14. Also consider again how you translated “set up” and “pillar” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 28:18, 22; 31:13, 45, 51, 52; 35:14, 20.

“{In fact,} that {same} pillar/stone still marks Rachel’s/her grave/tomb”

to this day.
“to/in the present day.” or “today/now.” The phrase “to this day” refers to the time when the author (Moses) was living. Even in modern times, Rachel’s grave is still marked beside the road about eight kilometers (five miles) south of Jerusalem and two kilometers (one mile) north of Bethlehem.

35:21-26 Jacob’s Twelve Sons
 
Gen 35:21 Then Israel set out and pitched his tents beyond Migdal Eder. 

Then Israel set out 
“Then Israel {that is, Jacob,} {and his family} moved on {from there}” or “Then Israel {and his family} started traveling again”. Make sure it is clear in your translation or in a footnote that “Israel” (verses 21-22) and “Jacob” (verses 20, 22) refer to the same person, not two different people.

and pitched his tents 
“and set/put up his/their tents”

beyond
“on the other/south side of”. This phrase reflects the perspective of Jacob, who was traveling south.

Migdal Eder.
“the tower of Eder.” or “Eder Tower.” Many translations transliterate “Migdal Eder” (like most other names). Many others translate the meaning of “Migdal” as “the tower” and transliterate “Eder”. A few translate the meaning of the entire name as “the Tower of the Flock”. This was apparently a place near Bethlehem where sheep were raised (Micah 4:8); shepherds may have watched over their flocks from the tower. (See: translate-names)


Gen 35:22 And it happened while Israel was living in that land, then Reuben went and lay with Bilhah, the concubine of his father, and Israel heard. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve. 

And it happened while
“During the time that” or “While” 

Israel was living

“{his/Israel’s son} Reuben” 

went and lay with
“slept with” or “committed adultery with” or “had {physical/sexual} relations with”. Translate this idiom in a way that will not offend or embarrass people, especially when read aloud in public. See how you translated “lain with” in Gen 26:10. (See: figs-euphemism)

Bilhah, the concubine of his father,
“his father’s concubine Bilhah,” or “his father’s servant wife Bilhah,”

“And the sons {he/Jacob had} with Leah’s servant Zilpah {were} Gad and Asher.” or “These are {the names of} the sons {that he/Jacob had} with Leah’s servant Zilpah: Gad and Asher.” Consider again how you translated “maidservant” throughout the book of Genesis. See Gen 12:16, 16:1-3, 5-6, 8; 20:14; 24:35; 25:12; 29:24, 29; 30:4, 7, 9-10, 12, 18, 43; 32:5, 22; 33:1-2, 6; 35:25-26. It may be necessary to translate this word in slightly different ways, depending on the context. Compare that to how you translated a different Hebrew word that has a similar meaning (“slave/servant woman”); see Gen 31:33 for a list of where this word occurs in Genesis.

Those {are} the sons of Jacob who were born to him 
“{All} those {are/were} the sons Jacob had” or “Those {are/were} {all} Jacob’s sons that he had”

“Then Jacob came/went {home} to his father Isaac {who was living}” or “Then Jacob continued traveling and came to where his father Isaac was {living}”

36:1-19 Esau’s Descendants
1 Chronicles 1:34-54

Gen 36:1 And these {are} the generations of Esau, who {is} Edom.

And these {are} the generations of Esau,
“Now this is the genealogy/family-line of Esau,” or “These/Here are the descendants of Esau,” or “Here {is} the/a record/history about the descendants/family of Esau,” See how you translated “the generations of” in 25:12, 19. 

who {is} Edom.
“that {is}, Edom.” or “whose {nickname} was Edom.” or “who {was also called} Edom.” The name Edom means “red” and is the nickname that Esau got for trading his birthright to Jacob for some reddish-colored stew (Genesis~25:29-34). The region of Edom and the Edomites were named after Esau, which is probably why this chapter repeatedly mentions that Esau is Edom. (See: figs-explicit)
   

Gen 36:2 Esau had taken his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah, the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah {and} the {grand}daughter of Zibeon the Hivite,

Esau had taken his wives from the daughters of Canaan: 
“Esau had chosen {two of his} wives from {among} the Canaanite women” or “Esau had married {two} Canaanite women” or “Esau had married {two} women who were descendants of Canaan”. Only the first two wives mentioned in this chapter were Canaanites; see the comment about Basemath at verse 3. The Canaanites were the descendants of Noah’s grandson Canaan (Ham’s son) and included the Hittites and Hivites (verse 2; Genesis 10:15-18) and several other people groups. You could put some of that information in a footnote. (See: figs-explicit)

Adah, 
“{including} Adah,” or “{Their names were} Adah,” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

the daughter of Elon the Hittite,
“{who was} the daughter of a Hittite named Elon,” or “whose father was Elon, {who was} a descendant of Heth,” or “the daughter of Elon, {who was} a member of the Heth/Hittite people {group},” Make sure your translation does not sound like Elon was the only Hittite. See how you translated “Hittites” in Gen 27:46. (See: translate-names)

and Oholibamah, 
“and {also} Oholibamah,” Notice that the names of Esau’s two Canaanite wives here are different from the names of his wives mentioned in Gen 26:34. It could be that they each had two names, or these may be different wives that he married later.

the daughter of Anah {and} the {grand}daughter of
“{who was} Anah’s daughter {and} the {grand}daughter of” or “whose father was Anah and whose grandfather was”. Notice that “Anah” and “Zibeon” are the names of men here, not women. (See: translate-names)

Zibeon the Hivite,
“a Hivite named Zibeon.” or “Zibeon {who was} a descendant of Hivi.” or “Zibeon {who was} a {member of the} Hivi/Hivite people {group}.” Make sure that your translation does not sound like Zibeon was the only Hivite. Consider again how you translated “Hivites” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 10:17; 34:2; 36:2. (See: translate-names)


Gen 36:3 and Basemath, the daughter of Ishmael {and} the sister of Nebaioth.

and Basemath, 
“{Esau also married} Basemath,” Since this Basemath was a daughter of Ishmael (who was a descendant of Noah’s son Shem), she was not a Canaanite, in contrast to Esau’s first two wives (verse 2). She was also known as Mahalath (Gen 28:9); you could include some of that information in a footnote. Be consistent here with how you spelled Basemath (a different woman with the same name) in Gen 26:34.

the daughter of Ishmael {and} the sister of Nebaioth.
“{who was} Ishmael’s daughter {and} Nebaioth’s {younger} sister.” or “whose father was Ishmael and whose {older} brother was Nebaioth.” Since Nebaioth was Ishmael’s oldest child (Gen 25:13), Basemath (Mahalath) was his younger sister, probably from the same mother. Use a kinship term here in your language that fits with those facts. See how you translated “the sister of Nebaioth” in Gen 28:9. (See: translate-kinship)

“was {just} not big enough to support/feed them {all} because they owned/had so many livestock/animals.” or “did not have enough grazing areas {or water} to support/feed all the livestock/animals that both families owned/had.” For some languages it is necessary to switch the order of verses 6 and 7, and say, “After a while, Esau and Jacob had so many animals and other possessions that the land was not able to support both their families. So Esau took his wives...” If you do this in your translation, you should label these verses as “6-7”. (See: translate-versebridge)

Gen 36:31 And these {were} the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before a king reigned for the sons of Israel.

And these {were} the kings 
“These {are} {the names of} the kings” or “This/Here {is} {a record/history about} the kings”. See how you translated “kings” in Gen 17:6 and 35:11. Be sure to distinguish “kings” (verses 31-39) from “chiefs” (verses 15-19, 21, 28, 40-43) in your translation of this chapter.

who reigned in the land of Edom 
“who reigned/ruled over {the people of/in} the land/region of Edom”

before a king reigned for the sons of Israel. 
“before there were any kings reigning/ruling over the descendants/people of Israel.” or “before the Israelites had their own king.” or “during the time {period} when the Israelites did not yet have their own king.” See how you translated “the sons of Israel” in Gen 32:3.


Gen 36:32 And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom, and the name of his city {was} Dinhabah.

And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom, 
“Bela, {who was} the son of Beor, was the {first} king to rule over {the people of} {the land/region of} Edom.” or “The {first} king to rule/reign over {the people of} {the land/region of} Edom was Bela, the son of Beor.” (See: figs-infostructure)

and the name of his city {was} Dinhabah.
“The name of his hometown {that he ruled from} {was} Dinhabah.” or “His {capital} city {that he ruled from} {was} Dinhabah.” Dinhabah was probably King Bela’s hometown, which he ruled the land of Edom from as his capital city.
 

Gen 36:33 Then Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah from Bozrah reigned in his place.

Then Bela died, and 
“When {King} Bela died,”

Jobab the son of Zerah from Bozrah reigned in his place. 
“Jobab, {who was} the son of Zerah from {the city of} Bozrah}, took his/Bela’s place as king.” or “Jobab, {who was} the son of Zerah, replaced/succeeded him/Bela as king {and ruled} from {his hometown of} Bozrah.” The phrase “from Bozrah” probably means this was Jobab’s hometown which he ruled from, much like the meaning of “his city” in verses 32, 35 and 39. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 36:34 Then Jobab died, and Husham from the land of the Temanites reigned in his place.

Then Jobab died, and
“When {King} Jobab died,”

Husham from the land of the Temanites reigned in his place.
“Husham, {who was} from the land/region of the Teman/Temanite people {group}, took his/Jobab’s place as king.” or “Husham replaced/succeeded him/Jobab as king {and reigned/ruled} from {his hometown which was in} the land/region where the Temanites lived.” King Husham may have been a descendant of Esau’s grandson Teman (verse 11). You could put that information in a footnote. Also compare how you translated verse 33. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 36:35 Then Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad reigned in his place, who struck the Midianites in the field of Moab. And the name of his city {was} Avith.

in the field of Moab. 
“in a field {in the region/land} of Moab.” or “in the region/land/country of Moab.” Moab was a large region located to the east of the Dead Sea. This battle probably took place in the countryside or an unpopulated area (a “field”) within this region.

And the name of his city {was} Avith.

Gen 36:37 Then Samlah died, and Shaul from Rehoboth {on} the river reigned in his place. 

Then Samlah died, and
“When {King} Samlah died,” 

Shaul from Rehoboth {on} the river reigned in his place.
“Shaul {who was} from {the city of} Rehoboth {on/beside} the River {Euphrates} took his/Samlah’s place as king.” or “Shaul replaced/succeeded him/Samlah as king {and ruled} from {his hometown of} Rehoboth, which was {beside} the {Euphrates} River.” See how you translated similar sentences in verses 33, 34 and 36.

Then Shaul died, and Baal-Hanan the son of Acbor 
“When {King} Shaul died, Baal-Hanan, {who was} the son of Acbor,”

“took his place as king.” or “replaced/succeeded him as king.” 


Gen 36:39 Then Baal-Hanan the son of Acbor died, and Hadar reigned in his place, and the name of his city {was} Pau. And the name of his wife {was} Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred {and} the granddaughter of Me-Zahab.

Then Baal-Hanan the son of Acbor died, and Hadar 
“When {King} Baal-Hanan died, Hadar”. Most translations follow the Hebrew text and have “Hadar” here. Some translations (and ancient versions such as SP, LXX, Syriac and Vulgate) have “Hadad” here instead, in order to spell this name the same way it is spelled in 1 Chronicles 1:50-51. However, that could cause confusion because “Hadad” is also the name of a different king in verses 35-36 above. (See: translate-names)

“took his place as king” or “replaced/succeeded him as king”. Consider again how you translated this phrase in verses 33-39.

“and the name of his hometown {that he ruled from} {was} Pau.” or “His {capital} city {that he ruled from} {was} Pau.” Consider whether it is best in your language to begin a new sentence here. Also see how you translated a similar clause in verses 32 and 35.

And the name of his wife {was} Mehetabel, 
“His wife’s name {was} Mehetabel,”

“Timna, Alvan, Jetheth,” The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. (1) Most translations treat all the names in verses 40-43 as the names of chiefs (as in the ULT and UST of these verses). (2) However, some scholars think that all the names in verses 40-43 are the names of regions or clans. Alternate translation of verses 40-43: “{These were} {the names of} the clans/tribes {that descended} from Esau. Each clan/tribe lived {in the land of Edom} in its own region that was named after that clan/tribe. {The names of the clans/tribes} were TImna, Alvan,...Iram.

“Now Jacob was {still} living” or “Jacob continued to live”. Chapter 37 continues the history about Jacob that left off at the end of chapter 35. Begin this chapter in a way that is natural in your language. Make sure the way you translate “lived” allows for the fact that Jacob was already living in Canaan and had settled near the city of Hebron, where his father and grandfather had lived previously (Gen 35:27). 

in the land of his father’s sojournings, in the land of Canaan.
“in the land/region of Canaan, where his father {Isaac} had lived for a while {as a foreigner/outsider}.” See how you translated “sojourned” in Gen 35:27 and “the land of Canaan” in Gen 35:6.


Gen 37:2 These {are} the generations of Jacob: Joseph, a son of seventeen years, was shepherding the flock{s} with his brothers, and he {was} an assistant with the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives, and Joseph brought a bad report about them to their father.

These {are} the generations of Jacob: 
“This/Here is {more of} the record/history about Jacob and his descendants/family:” or “What follows tells {more} about Jacob and his descendants/family:” Consider again how you translated “These are the generations of” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 2:4; 6:9; 11:27; 25:19; 36:1; 37:2, where what follows is a narrative or history of events. Compare that to Gen 5:1; 10:1; 11:10; 25:12; 36:9, where what follows is more of a genealogy (list of names). It may be necessary to translate this phrase in different ways, depending on the context.

Joseph, a son of seventeen years,
“{One day} {his} seventeen-year-old son Joseph” or “{Jacob’s/His son} Joseph, who was seventeen years old,” This verse may be referring to a single incident or it may be referring to what happened regularly.

was shepherding the flock{s}
“was taking care of the {family’s} flock{s} {of sheep and goats}” or “had the work/job of pasturing/tending the {family’s} flock{s} {of sheep and goats}”. See how you translated “flocks” in Gen 4:2.

with his brothers, and he {was} an assistant with 
“Joseph was helping his brothers {who were}” or “as an assistant/helper for his brothers {who were}”

the sons of Bilhah and the sons of Zilpah, his father’s wives, 
“the sons of his father’s {servant-}wives Bilhah and Zilpah,” Be consistent here with how you spelled “Bilhah” in Gen 29:29 and “Zilpah” in 29:24.

and Joseph brought a bad report about them to their father.
“and he told their/his father about the bad things they were doing.” or “and he gave bad/negative reports to their/his father about them.” The Hebrew text does not specify what Joseph’s brothers had done wrong, so neither should your translation. Also, make sure your translation of “their father” does not sound like the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah had a different father than Joseph had. (See: writing-pronouns)

Gen 37:3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all of his sons because he {was} a son of his old age. So he made a multicolored tunic for him.

Now Israel
“Now {Jacob whose other name was} Israel” or “Israel {(whose other name was Jacob)}” or “Israel {(that is, Jacob)}”. This verse introduces background information for the events that happen next. Consider what is the best way to begin this sentence in your language. Make sure it is clear in your translation or in a footnote that Jacob (verse 1) and Israel (verse 3) refer to the same person, not two separate people. For a note about this, see Gen 35:10. (See: figs-explicit)
   
loved Joseph more than all of his sons 
“loved Joseph more than any of his {other} sons”

because he {was} a son of his old age. 
“because he/Joseph was born to him when he was old.” For some languages it is more natural to put this clause first in this verse and say, “Now Joseph was born to Israel when he was old, so he/Israel loved him more than all {the rest} of his sons.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

So he made a multicolored tunic for him.
“So he made a {special/beautiful} tunic/robe for him that had many colors.” or “So he made a {special} colorful tunic/robe for him.” The meaning of the Hebrew text is not certain here. Many translations (including the Greek Septuagint and Latin Vulgate) say that the tunic or robe was “multicolored” or “colorful”. This “tunic” was probably full-length to the ankles and had long sleeves that reached to the hands. (See: translate-unknown)


Gen 37:4 And his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all of his brothers, so they hated him and were not able to speak to him peaceably.

And his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all of his brothers, so
“Joseph’s brothers saw/realized that their father loved him/Joseph more than any of {the rest of} his sons, so” or “When Joseph’s brothers saw/realized that their father loved him/Joseph more than the rest of them,”

they hated him and 
“they hated/despised him/Joseph so much that they”. Make sure it is clear here in your translation that the brothers hated Joseph, not their father. (See: writing-pronouns)

were not able to speak to him peaceably.
“could/would not speak/talk to him kindly/nicely.” or “refused to speak/talk to him in a friendly/kind manner/way.” or “and always spoke unkindly/disrespectfully to him.”

Gen 37:5 Then Joseph dreamed a dream and told it to his brothers, and they continued to hate him even more.

Then Joseph dreamed a dream 
“Then {one night} Joseph had a dream” or “{One night} Joseph had a dream”

and told it to his brothers, 
“and he told his brothers about it” or {The next day} he told his brothers what he dreamed”

and they continued to hate him even more.
“and they became even more hateful toward him.” or “That made them hate/despise him even more {than before}.”


Gen 37:6 And he said to them, “Please hear this dream that I dreamed:

And he said to them, 
“He told them,” or “{This is what} he told them:”

Gen 37:7 And behold, we were binding sheaves in the middle of a field, and behold, my sheaf got up and also stood upright, and behold, your sheaves gathered around and bowed down to my sheaf.” 

And behold,
“{In it} I saw” or “{In my dream} I saw”

we were binding sheaves in the middle of a field, 
“that we {all} were out in the middle of a field {cutting stalks of grain/wheat and} tying the stalks into sheaves/bundles” or “us {working together} out in a field {cutting and} tying sheaves/bundles {of grain/wheat stalks},” A sheaf of grain is a bunch of grain stalks that have been cut and tied together in a bundle, with the heads of grain at the top. Wheat and barley were the grains that were common in this region at that time, not corn or oats. 

and behold, 
“Then suddenly”

my sheaf 
“my sheaf/bundle {of grain/wheat}” or “the sheaf/bundle that I had made”

Gen 37:8 Then his brothers said to him, “Will you really reign over us? Will you really rule over us?” And they continued to hate him even more because of his dreams and because of his words.

Then his brothers said to him, 
“His brothers responded to him,” or “His brothers retorted {angrily},”

“Will you really 
“Do you really expect to” or “Certainly you don’t think you will” or “You will never”. The brothers use two rhetorical questions in this verse to express their disagreement with Joseph and to emphasize that they are not happy with him. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-rquestion)

“reign over us!” or “be our king!” For languages that mark inclusive and exclusive pronouns, “us” excludes Joseph in this sentence. (See: figs-exclusive)

Will you really rule over us?”
“You will never rule over us!” (See: figs-rquestion)
     
And they continued to hate him 
“So they hated/despised him”. Consider again how you translated “hate” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 24:60; 26:27; 29:31, 33; 37:4-5, 8. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.

“even more {strongly/intensely} {than they did before}”

because of his dreams and because of his words.
“for his dreams and for what he told them about the/his dreams.” or “because of what he had said {to them} about his dreams.” For some languages, it is more natural to switch the order of clauses in this sentence and say, “So because of what he/Joseph had told them about his dreams, his brothers hated him even more {strongly/intensely} {than they did before}.” Do what is best in your language.

(See: translate-symaction)


Gen 37:10 And he related it to his father and to his brothers, but his father rebuked him and said to him, “What {is} this dream that you dreamed? Will your mother and I and your brothers really come to bow down to the ground to you?”

And he related it to his father and to his brothers, but
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. Verse 10 could refer to: (1) a second time that Joseph told his dream. Alternate translation: “Then/Later Joseph told {the same dream} to {both} his father and his brothers, but”. (2) the same time that he told this dream to his brothers in verse 9. Alternate translation: “When Joseph related/told {the dream} to his father and his brothers,”

his father rebuked him and said to him, 
“his father rebuked/scolded him by saying,” Your translation of this quote margin should not sound like two separate events; the verbs “rebuked” and “said” refer to the same event.
(See: writing-quotations)

“What {is} this dream that you dreamed? 
“That {is} a strange dream that you had!” or “Your dream {is} ridiculous/outrageous!” Jacob uses a rhetorical question here to show that he is not happy about Joseph’s dream. Decide the best way to translate this in your language. (See: figs-rquestion)

Will your mother and I and your brothers really

37:12-36 Joseph’s Brothers Sell Him As A Slave
 
Gen 37:12 Then his brothers went to shepherd the flock{s} of their father near Shechem.

Then his brothers

“Get ready so that I can send you to them.”

And he said to him, 
“He/Joseph responded,” or “He/Joseph answered him,”

Gen 37:15 And a man found him, and behold, he was wandering around in the fields. So the man asked him, saying, “What are you looking for?”

And a man found him, and behold, he was 
“There he met a man who had seen/noticed him” or “{When he arrived there,} a man saw him”. In this context “found” means the man happened to meet Joseph as Joseph was walking around looking for his brothers; the man was not intentionally looking for him. Also, for some languages it is clearer or more natural to change the order of the clauses in this sentence and say, “He started wandering around {searching} in the fields {near there}, where/and he met a man who asked...” or “As he was wandering around {searching} in the fields {near there}, he met a man who asked…” Do what is best in your language.

Gen 37:20 So now, come and let us kill him and throw him into one of the cisterns. Then we will say an evil animal devoured him, and we will see what his dreams become!”

So now, come and let us kill him

“into one of the {empty} pits/wells {here}.” A cistern was a large hole or pit that had been dug in the ground to catch rain water and store it there. It was wide at the bottom and had a small opening at the top. The sides of the hole were covered with plaster so that it would hold water. (See: translate-unknown)

Then we will say an evil animal 
“Then we will/can tell {people} that a fierce/vicious/ferocious {wild} animal”

But Reuben heard, and 
“But Reuben heard {their plan}, so” or “When Reuben heard {what they were planning,}”

“he {tried to} rescue/save Joseph from them”. The phrase “their hands” refers to Joseph’s brothers and their power to harm him. Consider whether you have a similar figure of speech in your language. (See: figs-synecdoche)

and said,
“and said {to them},” or “by urging them,” (See: writing-quotations)

Gen 37:22 And Reuben said to them, “Do not shed blood. Throw him into this cistern which {is} in the wilderness, but do not lay a hand on him,” in order to rescue him from their hand{s}, to return him to his father.

And Reuben said to them, 
“Then Reuben/he continued/added,” Some translations do not include this phrase, possibly because Reuben is still speaking to the same people. However, he may have paused between verses 21 and 22 to see the effect of what he said in verse 21. Also, the repeated quote margin helps emphasize what he says in verse 22. Do what is best in your language. (See: writing-quotations)

“Do not shed blood.

Throw him into this cistern 
“{Instead} put him into this {dry/empty} pit/well”. See how you translated “cistern” in verse 20.

Then they sat down to eat bread, 
“Then {some of} Joseph’s brothers sat down to eat a meal,” It is clear from verse 29 that Reuben was not there when his brothers made the plan to sell Joseph to the traders. (See: figs-explicit)

spices and balm and myrrh 
“{expensive} spices, healing resin/salve and incense”. Gilead was a mountainous region east of the Jordan River that was famous as a source of balm (or balsam), which was a rare tree resin that was used for perfume and for medicine. Myrrh was another type of tree resin that was used as incense and as medicine. You could put some of that information in a footnote. (See: translate-unknowns)

For he {is} our brother, our flesh.”
“After all, he {is} a member of our family, our own brother.” The phrase “our flesh” refers to the fact that they are closely related biologically. See how you translated a similar idiom (“my bone and my flesh”) in Gen 29:14. (See: figs-idiom)

“Judah’s brothers agreed {with him}.” or “Judah’s brothers agreed {to do what Judah had proposed/suggested}.” See how you translated “listened” in Gen 34:24.


Gen 37:28 Then the Midianite men, traders, passed by, and they drew Joseph up and lifted him out of the cistern and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty {shekels of} silver. Then they brought Joseph to Egypt.

Then the Midianite men, traders, passed by, and 
“So when/as the Midianite {(that is, Ishmaelite)} traders/merchants came by/near {them},” or “So when the {Ishmaelite} traders who were {also/sometimes called} Midianites were passing/going by {them},” The Ishmaelites (verses 25, 27-28; 39:1) and Midianites (verses 28 and 36) were the descendants of Abraham’s sons Ishmael and Midian (16:15; 25:1-2). However sometimes (as here) the names of those people groups are used interchangeably for the same people (also see Judges 8:22, 24, 26). Perhaps that was because the two people groups had intermarried. Or there may have been merchants from the two people groups in this caravan who bought and sold Joseph together. You could put some of that information in a footnote.

they drew Joseph up and lifted him out of the cistern 
“{some of} Joseph’s brothers pulled Joseph/him up out of the pit/well”. Not all of Joseph’s brothers were there, because we know from the next verse that at least Reuben was somewhere else when they sold Joseph. (See: figs-explicit)

and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty {shekels of} silver. 
“and sold him to the Ishmaelite {traders/merchants} for twenty {shekels/pieces of} silver.” See the note about shekels at Genesis 20:16. Twenty shekels of silver was equal to about one-fourth of a kilo (half a pound) and was the average price for a slave. You could put some of that information in a footnote. (See: translate-bmoney)

Then they brought Joseph to Egypt.
“Then the Ishmaelites took him to {the country of} Egypt.”

Gen 37:29 Then Reuben returned to the cistern, but behold, Joseph was not in the cistern, so he tore his clothes.

Then Reuben 
“Later Reuben {who had been gone for a while}”

returned to the cistern,
“returned to the pit/well,” or “came/went back to the pit/well {to get Joseph},” Consider again how you translated “cistern” in verses 20, 22, 24, 28-29.

but behold, Joseph was not in the cistern, 
“but he was shocked to see that Joseph was not there!” or “but to his surprise/horror, Joseph was gone!”

“The boy 
“The lad/youth” or “Joseph” or “Our {younger} brother”. Joseph was seventeen years old (verse 2), so this phrase should be translated in a way that is appropriate for his older brother to refer to him here. See how you translated a different word that has a similar meaning in Gen 21:12.

“is gone/missing!”

And I, where am I going?”
“Now what should/can I do?” or “Now I do not know what to do!” Reuben uses a rhetorical question here to express how distressed he is and to emphasize that he does not know what to do. Do what is natural in your language. (See: figs-rquestion)

“and dipped the robe in its blood.” For some languages it is more natural to switch the order of clauses in this verse and say, “Then/So Joseph’s brothers killed a young goat, took Joseph’s/his tunic/robe, and dipped it in the {goat’s} blood.” or “Then/So Joseph’s brothers killed a young goat and dipped Joseph’s/his tunic/robe in the {goat’s} blood.” Do what is best in your language.

Gen 37:32 Then they sent the multicolored tunic and had it brought to their father and said, “We found this. Please examine whether it {is} your son’s tunic or not.”

Then they sent the multicolored tunic and had it brought to their father and said, 
“Then they had someone take/bring the colorful tunic/robe back to their father and say {to him} {for them},” Consider again how you translated “multicolored/colorful tunic/robe” in verses 3, 23, 32.

“We found this. Please examine 
“We found this {tunic/robe}. Please look at it {to see/determine}”. See how you translated “examine” in Gen 31:32.

Then Jacob tore his clothes 
“Then Jacob tore his clothes {in grief/sorrow},” or “Jacob {was so grieved that he} tore his clothes”. See how you translated “tore his clothes” in verse 29. (See: translate-symaction)

and put sackcloth on his loins, 
“put on sackcloth,” or “put on mourning clothes,” It was a Hebrew custom to wear sackcloth, which was a rough/coarse garment made/woven from black goats’ hair, to show that the person was mourning for someone’s death. If this custom is not familiar in your culture, you could put that information in a footnote. (See: translate-unknown)

and he mourned for his son many days.
“and for many days he mourned/grieved that his son had died.” or “and for a {very} long time he mourned/grieved that/because his son was dead/gone.” See how you translated “mourn” in Gen 27:41. 


Gen 37:35 And all his sons and all his daughters got up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted and said, “For I will go down to my son in Sheol mourning.” So his father wept for him.

And all his sons and all his daughters 
“All Jacob’s sons and daughters”

got up to comfort him, 
“came {to him} {and tried} to comfort/console him,”

but he refused to be comforted 
“but he did not want to be comforted/consoled” or “but he did/would not let them comfort/console him”

and said,
“Instead he said {to them},”

“For I will go down to my son in Sheol mourning.”
“{No,} I will continue to mourn until I {die and} join my son down in Sheol.” or “{No,} I will continue to mourn {for my son} until I {die and} go down to be with him in the afterworld.” Sheol is the Hebrew name for the world of the dead, that is, the place where the spirits of dead people lived. You could put that information in a footnote. Your translation of “Sheol” should not refer to hell or a place of punishment. Some translations have “the grave” here, but that leaves out the idea of an afterlife that this sentence implies. (See: translate-unknown)

So his father wept for him.
“So/Then Joseph’s father continued to mourn/grieve {deeply} for him/Joseph.”

38:1-30 Judah And Tamar

Gen 38:1 And it happened at that time that Judah went down from with his brothers and settled near an Adullamite man, and his name {was} Hirah.

And it happened at that time that Judah went down from with his brothers 
“Meanwhile Judah left his brothers and went down”. The phrase “And it happened” introduces a new episode here. Some translations leave it implied. Do what is best in your language. (See: writing-newevent)

and settled near an Adullamite man,
“and settled/stayed/lived in {the town of} Adullam near {the home of} a man from there” or “to {the town of} Adullam and settled/stayed/lived near {the home of} a man from there”. The word “Adullamite” refers to the fact that Hirah was from the town of Adullam; it is not the name of a people group. The town of Adullam was about 19 kilometers (12 miles) northwest of the city of Hebron (37:14), and was lower in elevation, which is why the text says that Judah “went down” to get there.

and his name {was} Hirah. 
“whose name {was} Hirah.”


Gen 38:2 And there Judah saw the daughter of a Canaanite man, and his name {was} Shua, and he took her. Then he went to her, 

And there 
“{While he was living} there,” 

Judah saw the daughter of a Canaanite man, and his name {was} Shua, 
“Judah/he met the daughter of a Canaanite man named Shua” or “Judah/he met a Canaanite woman whose father {was} Shua,”

and he took her. 
“and he took her {as his wife}.” or “and he married her.” See how you translated a similar idiom (“took a wife”) in Gen 25:1. (See: figs-idiom)

Then he went to her, 
“Then he slept/lay with her,” or “Then he had {marital/sexual} relations with her,” See how you translated the idiom “went to” in Gen 6:4. (See: figs-euphemism)


Gen 38:3 and she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er.

and she conceived 
“and she became pregnant” 

and bore a son, 
“and gave birth to a son” or “When she gave birth, she had a son,” Consider whether or not it is better to begin a new sentence here in your language.

and he called his name Er. 
“whom he/Judah named Er.” Throughout Genesis, sometimes the father, sometimes the mother, and sometimes both are said to give their child his name.


Gen 38:4 Then she conceived again and bore a son, and she called his name Onan. 

Then she conceived again 
“Then Judah’s wife became pregnant again”. See how you translated verse 3, which is similar to verse 4.

and bore a son, 
“and gave birth to {another} son,” 

and she called his name Onan.
“and she named him Onan.”


Gen 38:5 Then she continued further and bore a son, and she called his name Shelah. And he was in Kezib when she bore him.

Then she continued further 
“Then she conceived again” or “Then she became pregnant yet again”

and bore a son, 
“and gave birth to {another} son,”

and she called his name Shelah. 
“and she named him Shelah.”

And he was in Kezib when she bore him.
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “He/Judah was in/at {the town of} Kezib when she gave birth to Shelah.” (2) “It was in {the town of} Kezib that she gave birth to him/Shelah.” or “She was in Kezib when she gave birth to him/Shelah.” For some languages it is more natural to change the order of the clauses in this sentence and say, “When she gave birth to Shelah, Judah/she was in {the town of} Kezib.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 38:6 Then Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name {was} Tamar.

Then Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name {was} Tamar.
“Years later, Judah got/chose a wife named Tamar for his firstborn/oldest son Er.” or “When Judah’s firstborn/oldest son Er grew up, Judah arranged/negotiated for him to marry a woman whose name {was} Tamar.” See how you translated the phrase “took a wife for” in Gen 21:21.


Gen 38:7 But Er, the firstborn of Judah, was evil in the eyes of Yahweh, so Yahweh killed him.

But Er, the firstborn of Judah, 
“But Judah’s firstborn/oldest son Er” or “But Er”. Some languages leave “the firstborn of Judah” implied here since Er was already called the firstborn in verse 6. The Hebrew text repeats that information here to emphasize Er’s relationship to Judah in the following events. Do what is best in your language.

was evil in the eyes of Yahweh, 
“did things that were evil/wicked in Yahweh’s sight/opinion,” or “did something/things that Yahweh considered/judged to be evil/wicked,” The Hebrew text does not specify what Er had done wrong, so neither should your translation. See how you translated the idiom “in the eyes of Yahweh” in Gen 6:8. (See: figs-idiom)

so Yahweh killed him.
“so Yahweh took his life.” or “so Yahweh caused him to die.”

Gen 38:8 Then Judah said to Onan, “Go to the wife of your brother and perform your duty to her and produce offspring for your brother.”

Then Judah said to Onan,
“After that, Judah told {his son} Onan,”

“Go to the wife of your brother
“Marry your brother’s wife/widow {Tamar} {according to our custom}”. The Israelites practiced the custom of Levirate marriage, which meant that if a man died without any children, it was his oldest brother’s duty to marry his widow and have a son together who would carry on the deceased man’s family line and inherit his estate (see Deuteronomy 25:5-6). You could put some of that information in a footnote.

and perform your duty to her 
“so that you fulfill your duty/obligation to her {as her brother-in-law}”

and produce offspring 
“and produce/have children {with her}”

for your brother.”

Gen 38:9 However Onan knew that the offspring would not be his, so it happened when he went to the wife of his brother, then he spilled {it} on the ground so that he would not give offspring to his brother.

However Onan knew that the offspring would not be his, 
“However/But Onan knew that the children {they would have together} would not belong to him.”

so it happened when 
“So whenever” or “So every time” 

he went to
“he slept/lay with” or “he had {marital/physical} relations with” (See: figs-euphemism)

the wife of his brother,
“his brother’s wife/widow {Tamar},” or “Tamar,”

then he spilled {it} on the ground 
“he wasted {his semen} on the ground” or “he caused/let {his semen} to spill/go on the ground”. Translate this clause in a way that is polite and will not shame or embarrass people when this verse is read aloud in public. Make sure it is clear that Onan did something to keep Tamar from getting pregnant.

so that he would not give offspring to his brother.
“so that he would not have offspring/children for his brother.” or “to keep her from {getting pregnant and} having {any} offspring/children for his brother.” 


Gen 38:10 And what he did was evil in the eyes of Yahweh, so he killed him also.

And what he did was evil in the eyes of Yahweh, 
“Yahweh considered/judged what he/Onan did to be evil/wicked,” or “But that was evil/wicked in Yahweh’s sight/opinion,” See how you translated “evil in the eyes of Yahweh” in verse 7.

so he killed him also.
“so he/Yahweh took his life too/also.” or “so he/Yahweh caused him to die too.”

Then the days were many, and 
“Many years later,” or “After a long time,” or “Years went by and then”

Shua’s daughter, the wife of Judah, died.
“Judah’s wife, the daughter of Shua, died.” or “Judah’s wife, {who was} Shua’s daughter, died.” Notice that Shua was the father of Judah’s wife. Be consistent here with how you spelled his name in verse 2.

Then Judah was comforted, and 
“After Judah finished mourning/grieving {for her}, {one day}” or “After Judah had completed the {customary} time of mourning/grieving {for her},” See how you translated “comforted” in Gen 37:35.

“he {decided to} go to {the town of} Timnah”. Make sure your translation of this clause does not sound like Judah had already arrived at Timnah, because he does not actually reach there until verse 19. His trip from the town of Adullam (verse 1) to the town of Timnah was about 13 kilometers (8 miles).

to {the men} who were shearing his sheep,

So she took off her widow’s clothes from on her 
“So she changed from her clothes that showed she was a widow” or “So she changed {into different clothes} from the kind of clothes that widows wear”. Make sure it is clear in your translation that Tamar did not just take off her widow’s clothes, but that she also put different clothes on. (See: figs-explicit)

and covered herself with a veil 
“and covered herself with a {large} veil/shawl” or “and covered her face with a {thin} veil/headscarf”. A veil was a large piece of thin cloth that was used to cover the face and/or the body. See how you translated “veil” in Gen 24:65.

“Meanwhile Judah” or “After that, Judah”

sent the kid goat by the hand of his friend the Adullamite 
“sent a young goat with his friend {Hirah} {who was} from {the town of} Adullam” or “sent his friend {Hirah} the Adullamite with a young goat”. See how you translated “his friend...the Adullamite” in verse 12 and “kid goat” in verse 17.

to get back the pledge from the hand of the woman,
“to retrieve/reclaim his things from the woman/prostitute {whom he had given them to}.” or “to exchange it for the things he had left with the woman/prostitute.” or “to get back from the woman/prostitute the things he had left with her.”

but he did not find her.
“But he/Hirah was not able to find her.” or “But {when he/Hirah looked for her,} he could not find her.”


Gen 38:21 So he asked the men of her place, saying, “Where {is} the temple prostitute who {was} at Enaim beside the road?” But they said, “There has not been a temple prostitute in this place.”

So he asked the men of her place, saying, 
“So he/Hirah asked {some} men {who lived} near the place where she had been,”

“Where {is} the temple prostitute who {was} at Enaim beside the road?” 
“Where {is} the temple/shrine prostitute who {was sitting} beside the road near {the town of} Enaim?” Pagan religions had fertility rites at their temples or shrines that included professional prostitutes. Make sure your translation of “temple prostitute” does not refer to any temple built by the Israelites. Also be consistent here with how you translated “Enaim” in verse 14.

But they said, 
“But they answered {him},”

“There has not been a temple prostitute 
“There has never been a temple/shrine prostitute” or “No temple/shrine prostitute has ever been” 

in this place.”
“in/near this place/town.” or “around here.”


Gen 38:22 So he returned to Judah and said, “I did not find her. And also, the men of the place said, ‘There has not been a temple prostitute in this {place}.’ ”

So he returned to Judah 
“So/Then Hirah went/came back to Judah”

and said,
“and said/reported {to him},” or “and told/informed {him},” (See: writing-quotations)

“I did not find her. 
“I was not able to find the woman/prostitute.”

And also, 
“In fact,” or “And besides that,”

the men of the place 
“the men who live {around} there” or “the men who live in/near that town”

said, ‘There has not been a temple prostitute in this {place}.’ ”
“claimed, ‘There has never been a temple/shrine prostitute in/near this {place/town}.’ ” or “say/claim that there has never been a temple/shrine prostitute near/around there.” See how you translated this same quote in verse 21. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to translate this as an indirect quote here in verse 22. (See: figs-quotations)


Gen 38:23 And Judah said, “Let her take {the things} for herself so that we do not become a laughingstock. Behold, I sent this kid, but you did not find her.”

And Judah said, 
“Then Judah said/replied {to him},” (See: writing-quotations)

“Let her take {the things} for herself
“{Stop looking for her and} let her keep {my things} for herself”

so that we do not become a laughingstock. 
“so that people do not laugh at us.” or “Otherwise everyone will make fun of us.” or “so that we are not publicly shamed.” The pronouns “we” and “us” are inclusive here because Judah is including Hirah; some languages might use a dual pronoun. Use the pronouns that work best in your language in this context. (See: figs-exclusive)

Behold, 
“Besides that,” or “After all,” 

I sent this kid,
“I {did try to} send/deliver this goat {to her},” or “I sent {you to deliver} this goat {to her},”

but you did not find her.”
“but you could not find her.” or “but you were not able to find her.”

Gen 38:24 Then it happened about three months later that it was told to Judah, saying, “Tamar your daughter-in-law has prostituted herself, and also behold, {she is} pregnant by her prostitutions!” So Judah said, “Bring her out and let her be burned!”

Then it happened about three months later that 
“About three months later,” The phrase “Then it happened” introduces an important part of the story and helps create suspense or anticipation, so that it leaves the audience wondering what will happen next. Some translations leave it implied. Do what is best in your language.

it was told to Judah, saying, 
“someone said/reported to Judah,” or “someone told/informed Judah,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Tamar your daughter-in-law 
“Your daughter-in-law Tamar”. Consider again how you translated “daughter-in-law” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 11:31; 38:11, 16, 24.

has prostituted herself,
“has acted/behaved like/as a prostitute.” Some languages have an idiom for this phrase. Do what is best in your language. See how you translated “prostitute” in Gen 34:31, 38:15 and “temple prostitute” in verses 21-22.

and also behold, {she is} pregnant by her prostitutions!”
“In fact, look, {she is} {now} pregnant from doing that!” or “In fact, as a result of her immoral/indecent behavior {she has become} pregnant!” or “and even worse, {she is} {now} pregnant because of that!”

So Judah said, 
“Judah said/responded {angrily},” (See: writing-quotations)

“Bring her out 
“Take her outside {the town}”. Executions were normally done outside of the city walls. (See: figs-explicit)

and let her be burned!”
“and burn her {to death}!” or “and {punish her by} burning her {to death}!”


Gen 38:25 She was being brought out, then she sent {a message} to her father-in-law, saying, “By the man whom these things belong to, I {am} pregnant.” Then she said, “Please identify whose signet and cords and staff these {are}.”

She was being brought out, then 
“{So they went to get her/Tamar, but} as they were taking her out {of the town},”

she sent {a message} to her father-in-law, saying,
“she sent {a messenger} to her father-in-law {along with his things} and {told the messenger to} say,” See how you translated “father-in-law” in verse 13.

“By the man whom these things belong to, I {am} pregnant.” 
“The man who owns these things is the one who got me pregnant.”

Then she said, “Please identify whose signet and cords and staff these {are}.”
“Please identify {the man} who owns this name/identification/signature seal/thing with its cord/string and this walking stick.” or “Please look at this name/identification/signature seal/thing with its cord/string and this walking stick. Do you know/recognize who they belong to?” For some languages it is more natural to omit the quote margin here, since what follows is a continuation of the message Tamar is sending to Judah. Do what is best in your language. See how you translated “signet” and “cord” and “staff” in verse 18. (See: writing-quotations)


Gen 38:26 And Judah identified {the things} and said, “She is more righteous than I {am}, because I did not give her to Shelah my son!” And he did not continue to know her more.

And Judah identified {the things} 
“Judah recognized {his things}” or “Judah saw/recognized {that the things she had were his}”

and said,
“and confessed/admitted,”

“She is more righteous than I {am}, 
“She/Tamar is right and I am wrong,”

because I did not 
“because I refused to”

give her to Shelah my son!”
“have my son Shelah marry her {as I was supposed/required to}!” or “let her marry my son Shelah {as I was supposed/required to}!” Be consistent here with how you spelled “Shelah” in verses 5, 11, 14.

And he 
“{So they released her/Tamar,} and {after that,} he/Judah”. For some languages it is necessary to make it explicit that they let Tamar go. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-explicit)

did not continue to know her more.
“never again laid/slept with her/Tamar.” or “never had {sexual} relations with her/Tamar again.” Consider again how you translated the idiom “knew” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 4:1 (and note), 17, 25; 19:8; 24:16; 38:26. It may be necessary to translate 38:26 differently, since the relationship in this verse was outside of marriage. Compare how you translated a related idiom (“went to”) in verse 18. (See: figs-euphemism)

Gen 38:27 Then it happened when {it was} time for her to give birth, then behold, twins {were} inside her womb!

Then it happened when {it was} time for her to give birth, 
“Months later, when Tamar {was ready} to give birth,” See how you translated “Then it happened” in verse 24. The same phrase occurs three times in verses 27-29 to draw attention to the peak of this chapter, the birth of Perez, who was the ancestor of King David and the Messiah.

then behold, twins {were} inside her womb!
“surprisingly/amazingly {there were} twins inside her!” or “they saw/realized that {there were} twins inside her!” or “it turned out that she was going to have twins!”


Gen 38:28 And it happened, as she was giving birth, then {one} put out a hand, and the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied {it} on his hand, saying, “This {one} came out first.”

And it happened, as she was giving birth, 
“While she was in labor,” or “As she was starting to deliver her babies,” See how you translated “giving birth” in Gen 35:16. This may need to be translated differently here because of the different context.

then {one} put out a hand, 
“{one of them} stuck out {his} hand” or “{one of the twins/babies} put/stuck out {his} hand”

and the midwife 
“Then/So the midwife {who was there}” or “Then/So the midwife {who was helping her}”. See how you translated “midwife” in Gen 35:17.

took a scarlet thread and tied {it} on his hand, saying,
“tied a {bright} red thread/string on/around his wrist and said,” The midwife did this because it was her responsibility to identify which baby was the firstborn.

“This {one} came out first.”
“This {one/baby} was born first.” 


Gen 38:29 But it happened, when he drew his hand back in, then behold, his brother came out. Then she said, “How have you breached for yourself a breach?” So he called his name Perez.

But it happened, when he drew his hand back in, then behold,
“But then the/that baby pulled his hand back inside, and suddenly/unexpectedly” 

his brother came out.
“his brother came out {first} {instead}.” or “his brother was born {first} {instead}.” (See: figs-explicit)

Then she said, 
“Then/So the midwife said/exclaimed {to the baby},” (See: writing-quotations)

“How have you breached for yourself a breach?”
“How did you break/burst yourself out like that?” or “What a dramatic/powerful way for you to break/burst out!” or “Just look at how you have forced your way out!” The midwife uses a rhetorical question here to emphasize how surprised she is that Perez was born first. Decide the best way to communicate this in your language. (See: figs-rquestion)

So he called his name 
“So he was named” or “That is why they named him”. The Hebrew text has “he called his name” here, which probably refers to Judah (Perez’s father). However most translations are more general and say “he was named” or “they named him”.

Perez.
“Perez, {which means “break/burst out.”}” If you include the meaning of Perez’ name in your translation or in a footnote, make sure it fits with how you translated the previous sentence. (See: translate-names)


Gen 38:30 And afterwards, his brother came out, who {had} the scarlet thread on his hand, and he called his name Zerah.

39:1-23 Joseph And Potiphar’s Wife

Gen 39:1 Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt, and Potiphar, an Egyptian man, an official of Pharaoh, the chief of the guards, had bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites who had taken him down there. 

Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt, 
“Now {as you know,} {Ishmaelite traders/merchants} had taken/brought Joseph down to {the country of} Egypt,” or “Back/Returning {now} to Joseph: {Remember that} he had been taken/brought down to {the country of Egypt {by Ishmaelite traders/merchants},” Chapter 39 picks up where 37:36 left off and repeats some events (that happened in chapter 37) to remind readers of what happened before chapter 38 interrupted the narrative. Make sure your translation does not sound like Joseph was taken to Egypt twice or sold to Potiphar twice. (See: writing-background)

and Potiphar, an Egyptian man, an official of Pharaoh, the chief of the guards,
“and/where an Egyptian {named} Potiphar, who was the captain over Pharaoh’s {personal} guards,” See how you translated “an official of Pharaoh, the chief of the guards” in Gen 37:36.

had bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites who had taken him down there.
“had bought him {as a slave/servant} from the Ishmaelites who had taken/brought him there.” For some languages it is clearer and more natural to change the order of clauses in this verse and say, “Now {as you know,} {some} Ishmaelite traders had taken/brought Joseph down to {the country of} Egypt, and an Egyptian {named} Potiphar had bought him {as a slave/servant} from them. Potiphar {was} {one of} Pharaoh’s officials/officers, the captain over the king’s {personal} guards.” Do what is best in your language. See how you translated “Ishmaelites” in Gen 37:25, 27-28. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 39:2 And Yahweh was with Joseph, and he was a successful man, and he was in the house of his Egyptian master.

And Yahweh was with Joseph, 
“But Yahweh was with Joseph {and helped/blessed him},” See how you translated “was with” in Gen 21:20; 26:28.

and he was a successful man, 
“so that he succeeded in what/everything he did” or “so that he did everything very well”

and he was in the house of his Egyptian master.
“as he worked in his Egyptian master’s/owner’s house.” For some languages it is more natural to put this clause first in this verse and say, “As Joseph worked in his Egyptian master/owner’s house, Yahweh was with him/Joseph {and helped/blessed him}, so that he succeeded in everything he did.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 39:3 And his master saw that Yahweh {was} with him and {that} Yahweh made all that he was doing successful in his hand. 

And his master saw that Yahweh {was} with him
“His/Joseph’s master/owner realized that Yahweh {was} with/blessing him/Joseph”. In verses 2 through 20, Potiphar is referred to as Joseph’s master (verses 2-3, 7-8, 16, 19-20) and “the Egyptian” (verse 5); he is no longer mentioned by his name in the Hebrew text. Some translations continue to use Potiphar’s name occasionally in verses 2 through 20 to prevent confusion and make it clear that all of these references refer to the same person, not two or three different people. Do what is best in your language. See how you translated “master” or “owner” in Gen 24:9-10.

and {that} Yahweh made all that he was doing successful in his hand.
“and was helping/enabling him/Joseph to succeed/prosper in everything that he did.” or “and was helping/enabling him/Joseph to do everything very well.” See how you translated “successful” in verse 2. 


Gen 39:4 So Joseph found favor in his eyes, and he served him. And he put him in charge over his house and gave into his hand all {that} was his.

So Joseph found favor in his eyes, and he served him.
“So he/Potiphar was pleased with Joseph/him {and treated him favorably/well} and made him his personal servant/attendant.” Make sure that your translation of “in his eyes” refers here to Joseph’s master, not Yahweh. Also see how you translated the idiom “found favor in...eyes” in Gen 6:8. (See: figs-idiom)

And he put him in charge over his house and gave into his hand
“He/Potiphar also put him/Joseph in charge of managing his household and taking care of” or “He/Potiphar also appointed him/Joseph as the manager/overseer of/over his {entire} household and entrusted into his care”. Make sure your translation of the pronouns (“he”, “him” and “his”) in verses 2 through 6 refers to the correct person at each point in the text. Also see how you translated the idiom “gave...into the hand of” in Gen 32:16. (See: writing-pronouns)

all {that} was his.
“everything {else} {that} he owned.” or “everything {that} belonged to him.”


Gen 39:5 And it happened from the time he put him in charge in his house and over all that was his, then Yahweh blessed the house of the Egyptian because of Joseph. So the blessing of Yahweh was on all that was his, in the house and in the fields.

And it happened from the time 
“Beginning from the time {that}” or “From the time {that}”

he put him in charge in his house and over all that was his,
“Joseph’s Egyptian master/owner put him in charge of/over his household and everything {else} that belonged to him,” or “he/Potiphar put him/Joseph in charge of managing everything that belonged to him,” or “Joseph’s Egyptian master/owner did that,” See how you translated “put him in charge...his house and...everything {that} was his” in verse 4. It is repeated in verse 5 in the Hebrew text to emphasize the authority that Joseph was given. Do what is natural in your language.

then Yahweh blessed the house of the Egyptian 
“Yahweh blessed the household of that Egyptian {man}” or “Yahweh caused that Egyptian’s household to prosper”. Make sure it is clear in your translation of this chapter that “Egyptian”, “master” and “Potiphar” all refer to the same person, not two or three different people.

because of Joseph.
“for Joseph’s sake/benefit.” or “because Joseph was working for him.”

So the blessing of Yahweh was on all that was his, 
“Yahweh/He blessed everything that belonged to him,” or “Yahweh/He caused everything that he owned to prosper,”

in the house and in the fields.
“{including} {everything} in {his} household/home and in {his} fields.” or “{including} {his family and servants} in {his} household, as well as {the crops and livestock} in {his} fields.” In this context, “house” especially refers to the people in the house and “fields” refers to what is in the fields. (See: figs-metonymy)


Gen 39:6 And he left all that {belonged} to him in the hand of Joseph, and he did not think to himself {about} anything except for the bread that he ate. Now Joseph was handsome in form and handsome in appearance. 

And he left all that {belonged} to him in the hand of Joseph, and
“In fact, he/Potiphar gave Joseph the responsibility of managing everything that he owned/had, so that” or “In fact, after/since Joseph’s owner put him in charge of everything that he owned,” See how you translated a similar idiom (“gave...into his hand”) in verse 4. (See: figs-idiom)

he did not think to himself {about} anything except for the bread that he ate.
“he did not {need to} concern himself with anything {in his household}, except for {personal things/matters like} {deciding} what {kind of} food {he wanted} to eat.” or “the only thing he {needed to} think/decide about {in his household} was {personal things/matters like} what food {he wanted} to eat.” For some languages, it is more natural to put the exception clause first in the sentence. Do what is best in your language. Also, Potiphar did more than decide what to eat; that was just one example of personal decisions which were all he had to concern himself with. (See: figs-explicit)

__________________Paragraph Break__________________

Now Joseph was handsome in form and handsome in appearance. 
“Joseph was well-built/muscular and good-looking.” or “Now Joseph was a very handsome young man.” Some languages have a conjunction such as “Now” that introduces background information and a change of topic. For other languages a paragraph break is enough (without a conjunction). Do what is best in your language. (See: writing-background)


Gen 39:7 And it happened after those things, then the wife of his master lifted her eyes toward Joseph and said, “Lie with me!”

And it happened after those things, 
“So after a while,” or “After {he had been/worked there for} a while,” The phrase “And it happened” introduces and emphasizes an important event. Many English translations do not include this phrase. Do what is natural in your language.

then the wife of his master
“his master’s/owner’s wife”

lifted her eyes toward Joseph 
“started looking {with desire/lust} at Joseph/him” or “started lusting for Joseph/him”. Many languages have a similar idiom that fits well here. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-idiom)

and said, 
“and said {to him},” or “and told/demanded {him},” Translate this quote introduction in a way that fits well with what Potiphar’s wife says to Joseph. (See: writing-quotations)

“Lie with me!”
“Sleep with me!” or “Come to bed with me!” See how you translated the idiom “lie with” in Gen 19:32. (See: figs-euphemism)


Gen 39:8 But he refused and said to the wife of his master, “Behold, with me {here}, my master does not think {about} what {is} in the house, and all that is his he has given into my hand. 

But he refused 
“But Joseph refused” or “But he/Joseph rejected {her request/demand}”

and said to the wife of his master,
“and said to her,” or “and told her,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Behold,
“Look/Listen,” or “Notice that”

with me {here},
“with me {in charge},” or “because of me,” or “since I am {working/serving} here,” 
 
my master does not think {about} 
“my master/owner does not {need to} think/worry {about}” or “my owner does not {need/have to} concern himself with”

what {is} in the house, 
“anything that {is} in {his} house” or “{managing} anything in {his} household”

and all that is his he has given into my hand.
“In fact, everything that he owns he has given/entrusted into/to my care” or “In fact, he has put me in charge of everything that he owns/has”. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin a new sentence here. See how you translated the idiom “gave into...hand” in verse 4. (See: figs-idiom)


Gen 39:9 He is not greater than me in this house, and he has not withheld anything from me except for you, because you {are} his wife. So how can I do this great evil, and sin against God?” 

He is not greater than me in this house, 
“{so that} he has no one in his household who has more authority than I do” or “{As a result,} {even} he does not exercise more authority in/over this/his household than I do”. As Joseph’s master, Potiphar still had more authority than Joseph. But he had given Joseph authority to act in his place over everything in his household. Try to make that clear in your translation. Also consider whether it is more natural in your language to begin verse 9 with a new sentence, or to continue the sentence from verse 8.

and he has not withheld anything from me except for you, because you {are} his wife. 
“and he has given me freedom with everything {in his household}, except you, {of course,} because you {are} his wife.” or “He allows me to do anything {in his household}, except with you, his wife.” The phrase “has not withheld” is a litotes that emphasizes the freedom that Potiphar had given Joseph. Some languages must translate this in a way that does not use a negative word such as “not”. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-litotes)

So how can I do this great evil, and sin against God?”
“So I refuse to do such an evil thing, which would be a terrible sin against God!” or “So there is no way I would {ever} sin against God by doing such an evil thing!” Joseph uses this rhetorical question to emphasize why he will not do what Potiphar’s wife wants. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-rquestion)


Gen 39:10 Then it happened even though she kept speaking to Joseph day {after} day, yet he did not listen to her to lie beside her, to be with her.

Then it happened even though she kept speaking to Joseph day {after} day, yet
“Even though Potiphar’s wife kept propositioning/pressuring Joseph every day {to lie/sleep with her},” or “Day after day, Potiphar’s wife kept pressuring/asking Joseph {to go to bed with her}, but”. The phrase “Then/And it happened” is used several times in this chapter (verses 5, 7, 10, 11, 13, 15, 18, 19) to introduce and emphasize important events and to increase suspense so that the audience wonders what the outcome will be. Many English translations have omitted this phrase, possibly for reasons of naturalness. Consider whether you have an expression like this that is natural in your language. 

he did not listen to her 
“he did not do what she wanted, but refused” or “he rejected her requests/demands”

to lie beside her, to be with her.
“to lie/sleep with her, and he stayed away from her.” or “to have sex with her and would not {even} go near her.”

Gen 39:11 Then it happened on such a day that he went into the house to do his work, and there were no other men of the house there in the house.

Then it happened on such a day that 
“{But} then on a day like that,” or “Then/But one such day” or “Then/But one day”

he went into the house to do his work, and
“Joseph went to {his master’s/owner’s} house {as usual} to do his work, and/but” or “when Joseph went into the/Potiphar’s house to work,”

there were no other men of the house there in the house. 
“no other menservants from the household were there.” or “none of the other household menservants were there.”


Gen 39:12 So she caught him by his garment, saying, “Lie with me!” But he left his garment in her hands and fled and went outside. 

So she caught him by his garment,
“So/Then Potiphar’s wife caught/grabbed {hold of} him/Joseph by his robe/tunic,” The word “garment” is very general and probably refers to an outer article of clothing, such as a robe or tunic.

saying, 
“{and} said {to him},” or “{and} said/demanded,” See how you translated this quote introduction in verse 7. (See: writing-quotations)

“Lie with me!”
“Come to bed with me!” or “Sleep with me!” See how you translated this quote in verse 7. (See: figs-euphemism)

But he left his garment in her hands and fled and went outside. 
“But {immediately} he fled and left his robe/tunic {behind} in her hands as he ran outside/outdoors.” or “But he {immediately} got away from her and fled/ran outside/outdoors, leaving his robe/tunic {behind} in her hands.” Make sure your translation does not sound here like Joseph put his garment in her hands. Rather it came off in her hands as he was fleeing.


Gen 39:13 Then it happened when she saw that he had left his garment in her hands and had fled outside, 

Then it happened when she saw 
“As soon as she saw” or “After/When she saw”

that he had left his garment in her hands and had fled outside,
“that Joseph had left his robe/tunic {behind} in her hands as he ran outside,” or “that Joseph had fled/run outside/outdoors and left his robe/tunic {behind} in her hands,” See how you translated a similar clause in verse 12. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 39:14 then she called for the men of her house and said to them, saying, “Look! He brought to us a Hebrew man to laugh at us! He came to me to lie with me, but I called out with a loud voice! 

then she called for the men of her house
“she called out for the {other} household menservants {to come to her}” or “she summoned the {other} menservants of/from her household {to come}”. See how you translated “men of the house” in verse 11. (See: figs-explicit)

and said to them, saying, 
“Then {when they arrived/came,} she exclaimed to them,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Look! 
“Look {at this}!” or “Look/See {what happened}!” As Potiphar’s wife speaks, she is probably showing the servants Joseph’s garment in her hands. (See: figs-explicit)

He brought to us a Hebrew man 
“My husband brought {this} Hebrew slave/servant {here} to/among us”. Make sure that your translation of “He brought” refers here to Potiphar (as verse 17 confirms), not Joseph. (See: writing-pronouns)

to laugh at us! 
“to mock/insult/humiliate us!” or “to make fools of us!” In this context, “us” is general and includes Potiphar’s wife and the people she is talking to. (See: figs-exclusive)

He came to me 
“He came here” or “That man/slave came {here} to me”. Make sure your translation of “He came” refers here to Joseph, not Potiphar (who was the subject of the previous sentence in the Hebrew text).

“Then/So he had Joseph arrested and put in the prison/jail” or “And/Then he {had soldiers} arrest Joseph and put him in the prison/jail”. Potiphar probably had soldiers arrest Joseph for him, since he had the authority to do that as the captain of the guards. Consider again how you referred to Joseph and Joseph’s master Potiphar in verses 1-20. As usual, after you finish translating a section like this, it is a good practice to read the section aloud at a normal pace and listen carefully to make sure you refer to everyone accurately and naturally at each point in the text.

40:1-23 The Chief Cupbearer’s And Chief Baker’s Dreams

Gen 40:1 Then it happened after those things {that} the cupbearer of the king of Egypt and the baker sinned against their lord, against the king of Egypt.

Then it happened after those things {that}
“Sometime after that,” or “After some time, {one day}”

the cupbearer of the king of Egypt and the baker 
“the {chief/head} wine-server and the {chief/head} baker for the king of Egypt” or “the man {who was in charge of those} who served wine to the king of/over Egypt and the man {who was in charge of those} who made/baked bread/food {for the king}”. The chief cupbearer was one of Pharaoh’s most trusted servants. He was in charge of serving Pharaoh anything that he wanted to drink, especially wine. It was his job to test the drink before Pharaoh had some, to make sure it was high quality and not poisoned. Some of that information could be put in a footnote. Also, it may be more natural to include here in verse 1 the fact that these were the head officials in these jobs, rather than wait until verse 2 to introduce that. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-explicit)

sinned against 
“disobeyed/displeased” or “offended”. The text does not say what the officials did wrong that angered Pharaoh. They may have done their jobs poorly in some way. Translate this phrase in a way that fits this context well in your language. (See: translate-key-terms)

their lord, against the king of Egypt.
“their master, {who was} {Pharaoh} the king of/over Egypt.” For some languages it is more natural to include here in verse 1 the fact that the king of Egypt was Pharaoh, rather than wait until verse 2 to introduce that. Do what is best in your language.


Gen 40:2 And Pharaoh broke out in anger against his two officials, against the chief of the cupbearers and against the chief of the bakers,

And Pharaoh 
“So Pharaoh/he” or “As a result, Pharaoh/he”. Make sure it is clear in your translation that Pharaoh (verse 2) is the same person as the king of Egypt (verse 1). See how you translated “Pharaoh” in Gen 12:15, and see the important note about this there. (See: translate-names)

broke out in anger against 
“was very angry at/with” or “was furious with”. Consider whether your language has an idiom similar to “broke out in anger” that fits well here. (See: figs-idiom)

his two officials, against the chief of the cupbearers and against the chief of the bakers, 
“the official in charge of serving wine to him and the official in charge of baking bread for him” or “his chief/head wine-server and chief/head baker” or “those two officials/officers.” It may be more natural to combine verses 1 and 2 and say, “Sometime after that, Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, became very angry at two of his officials, his chief wine-server and chief baker, because they had displeased him.” In this case, you would also combine the verse numbers (1-2) to show it is a verse bridge combining two verses. Do what is best in your language. (See: translate-versebridge)


Gen 40:3 and he put them in custody in the house of the chief of the guards, in the round-house, the place where Joseph was bound.

and he put them 
“So he had them {arrested and} put” or “So he {had his soldiers arrest them and} put them”. Often in the Bible (as here), when it says that a king (or someone else with authority) did something, it is implied that he had people who were under his authority actually do it. See how you translated a similar clause in Gen 39:20. (See: figs-explicit)

in custody
“under guard” or “in prison” 

in the house of the chief of the guards, 
“in/at the chief/captain of/over the guards’ house,” Apparently the round-house prison was part of the house where the chief of the guards lived and worked, perhaps a lower part (see Joseph’s use of the word “pit” in verse 15 to refer to this prison). See how you translated “chief/captain of the guards” in Gen 37:36 and 39:1.

in the round-house, the place where Joseph was bound. 
“{that is,} in the round-house {prison/jail}, the {same} place/prison where Joseph was imprisoned/confined.” or “in the same prison where Joseph was.” See how you translated “bound” in Gen 39:20.


Gen 40:4 And the chief of the guards assigned Joseph to them, so he attended them, and they were in custody {for} days.

And the chief of the guards 
“{There} the captain of/over the guards”

assigned Joseph to them, 
“assigned/appointed Joseph {to take care of them},”

so he attended them,
“so he served them,” or “and so he waited on them,”

and they were in custody 
“and they were {kept} in custody/prison” or “and they remained in custody/prison”. Some translations begin a new paragraph and sentence here that continues into verse 5 and say, “After they had been in prison {for} a while, 5 one night the king’s head wine-server and head baker dreamed...” (See: figs-infostructure)

{for} days.
“{for} some days/time,” or “{for} a while,” The phrase “{for} days” is a general expression that refers to an unspecified length of time.

Gen 40:5 Then the two of them dreamed a dream. Each {had} his {own} dream in the same night, each {man’s} dream had its own interpretation. {They were} the cupbearer and the baker who {belonged} to the king of Egypt, who were bound in the round-house.

Then the two of them dreamed a dream. Each {had} his {own} dream in the same night,
“Then one night the two of them each had a dream,” or “One night they both/each had a dream” (See: figs-infostructure)

each {man’s} dream had its own interpretation.
“{and} each of the dreams had its own interpretation/meaning.” or “each with its own interpretation/meaning.” or “Each {one’s} dream had its own meaning.” Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin a new sentence here.

{They were} the cupbearer and the baker who {belonged} to the king of Egypt, who were bound in the round-house.
“{This is talking about} the wine-server and the baker, who had served the king of Egypt and/but were in prison.” Many translations leave this sentence implied because it repeats information from the previous verses and may sound too repetitive. Or you could put this sentence earlier in this verse and say, “Then one night, the king of Egypt’s wine server and baker each had a dream while they were in prison, and each {man’s/one’s} dream had its own interpretation/meaning.” Make sure it is clear in your translation that the cupbearer and baker in verse 5 are the same officials as those in verses 2-4. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 40:6 And Joseph came to them in the morning and saw them, and behold, they were upset.

And Joseph came to them in the morning and 
“In the morning, Joseph came to {serve} them and” or “The next morning, when Joseph came to {serve} them, he”. Consider whether or not it is more natural in your language to have the time phrase “in the morning” first this verse. (See: figs-infostructure)

saw them, and behold, 
“saw/noticed that” or “was surprised to see that”

they were upset. 
“they were troubled.” or “they looked distressed/sad.”
 

Gen 40:7 So he asked Pharaoh’s officials who {were} with him in custody {in} the house of his master, saying, “Why {are} your faces sad today?”

So he asked Pharaoh’s officials who {were} with him in custody {in} the house of his master, saying, 
“So/And he asked Pharaoh’s officials/officers who {were} in prison with him in his master’s house,” or “So/And he asked them,” (See: writing-pronouns)

“Why {are} your faces sad today?”
“Why do your faces look so sad/downcast today?” or “Why do you look {so} sad/unhappy today?”
Some languages have an idiom that fits well here. Do what is natural in your language.


Gen 40:8 And they said to him, “We dreamed a dream, but {there is} no one to interpret it.” Then Joseph said to them, “Don’t interpretations {belong} to God? Please tell {them} to me.”

And they said to him, 
“They answered him,” or “They replied,” (See: writing-quotations)

“We dreamed a dream, 
“We {each} had a dream {last night},” or “{Last night} we {both/each} had a dream,”

but {there is} no one to interpret it.” 
“but there is no one {here} who can tell {us} what our dreams mean.” or “but we do not have anyone {here} to interpret/explain them {for us}.”

Then Joseph said to them, 
“Then/So Joseph replied,” or “Joseph replied,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Don’t interpretations {belong} to God?
“God is the {only} one who can explain the meaning {of dreams}.” or “God is the {only} one who gives someone/people the ability to interpret {the meaning of dreams}.” Joseph uses this rhetorical question to emphasize that God is the only one who interprets dreams. Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language. (See: figs-rquestion)

Please tell {them} to me.”
“Please tell me {what you dreamed}.” or “Please tell/describe {your dreams} to me {and God will reveal to me what they mean}.” Make sure that your translation of the last two sentences in this verse does not sound like Joseph is claiming to be God. Rather, he is saying that if the two officials tell their dreams to him, God will enable him to interpret the dreams. (See: figs-explicit)

Within three days 
“In three {more} days” or “Three days from now”

Pharaoh will lift up your head 
“Pharaoh will summon you” or “Pharaoh will have you brought up {out of prison}”. The idiom “lift up your head” means that the wine-server will be summoned or brought out from the lowly or shameful place where he had been staying. (See: figs-idiom)

Pharaoh will lift up your head from on you 
“Pharaoh will {have his soldiers} cut/chop off your head” or “Pharaoh will have you beheaded”. Here, the phrase “lift up your head from on you” seems to have a literal meaning (of having the baker beheaded) in contrast to the figurative meaning of “lift up your head” in verse 13 (where it means to summon from a lowly or shameful place). Make sure your translation of this phrase is accurate and clear in both contexts.

Do what is natural in your language. See how you translated “hang...on a tree” in verse 19.

41:1-36 Pharaoh’s Two Dreams

Gen 41:1 Then it happened {at} the end of two years of days, that Pharaoh was dreaming and behold, he was standing beside the River.

Then it happened {at} the end of two years of days, that
“After two full years had passed,” or “Two whole/complete years later,”

Pharaoh was dreaming and behold, he was standing
“{King} Pharaoh had a dream. {In the dream} he saw himself standing” or “{King} Pharaoh dreamed that he was standing”. See how you translated “Pharaoh” in Gen 40:2. (See: translate-names)

beside the River.
“beside the {Nile} River.” This phrase usually refers to the Nile River, which was the most important river in Egypt and was so well known by everyone that it was referred to as “the River”. See how you translated a different Hebrew word for “river” in Gen 36:37. (See: figs-explicit)


Gen 41:2 Then behold, from the River came up seven cows, fine-looking and fat-fleshed, and they grazed among the reeds.

Then behold,
“Then suddenly,” or “Then he saw that”

from the River came up seven cows, fine-looking and fat-fleshed,
“seven cows {that were} healthy-looking and fat/well-fed came/walked up out of the river {onto the bank/land}” or “seven healthy-looking, fat/well-fed cows came/walked up out of the river {onto the bank/land}”. Make sure your translation does not sound like the cows rose up out of the water into the air. Also see how you translated “cows” in Gen 32:15. 

and they grazed among
“and started grazing/eating” or “and started feeding on”

the reeds.
“the grass {that was there}.” or “the tall/marsh grass {beside the river}.”


Gen 41:3 Then behold, seven other cows came up after them from the River, ugly-looking and thin-fleshed, and they stood beside the {other} cows on the bank of the River.

Then behold, 
“Then suddenly,” or “Then/Next he saw that”

seven other cows came up after them from the River, ugly-looking and thin-fleshed,
“seven cows {that were} sickly-looking and scrawny/skinny walked up out of the river” or “seven sickly-looking, scrawny/skinny cows came/walked up out of the river” (See: figs-infostructure)

and they stood beside the {other} cows
“and stood next to the {first/healthy} cows” 

on the bank of the River.
“on the bank of the river.” or “on the river bank.” Consider again how you refer to “the River” in verses 1-3. If you refer to it as “the {Nile} River” in verse 1, it may be more natural to refer to it as “the river” after that. Do what is best in your language.


Gen 41:4 Then the ugly-looking and thin-fleshed cows ate the seven fine-looking and fat cows, and Pharaoh woke up.

Then the ugly-looking and thin-fleshed cows
“Then the sickly-looking, scrawny/skinny cows” or “Then the cows {that were} sickly-looking and scrawny/skinny”. See how you translated this phrase in verse 3.

ate
“ate/swallowed {up/down}” or “devoured”

the seven fine-looking and fat cows,
“the seven healthy-looking, fat/well-fed cows.” or “the seven cows {that were} healthy-looking and fat/well-fed.” See how you translated this phrase in verse 2.

and 
“{Just} then” or “After that,” or “At that point,”

Pharaoh woke up.
“{King} Pharaoh woke up.” or “the king woke up”. Consider the best way in your language to refer to Pharaoh at each point/occurrence in this chapter.

Gen 41:5 Then he fell asleep and dreamed a second {time}. And behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, fat and good. 

Then he 
“Then Pharaoh” or “Then the king”

fell asleep
“went to sleep {again}” or “went {back} to sleep”. (See: figs-idiom)

and dreamed a second {time}.
“and had a second {dream}.” or “and started dreaming again.” 

And behold,
“{This time} he saw” or “{In this dream} there were” 

seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, fat and good.
“seven big/plump, beautiful/well-formed heads of grain growing on the same stem/plant.” The phrase “heads of grain” is one word in the Hebrew text. Consider whether it is better in your language to use a word or phrase to translate this.
 

Gen 41:6 Then behold, seven heads of grain, thin and scorched {by} the east wind, sprouted after them. 

Then behold,
“Then suddenly,” or “Then/Next he saw {that}”

seven heads of grain, thin and scorched {by} the east wind
“seven small/shriveled heads of grain that were dried out {by} the {hot} east/desert wind” or “seven thin/shriveled heads of grain that the {hot} east/desert wind had dried out”. This wind was from the desert in the east, so it was hot and dry. (See: figs-explicit)

sprouted 
“grew/sprang up” or “started/were growing”

after them.
“next to them {on the same stalk/plant}.” or “{on the same stalk/plant} beside the first/well-formed heads.” Consider whether it is better in your language to refer to the first heads here with a pronoun (“them”) or a noun phrase. (See: writing-pronouns)


Gen 41:7 Then the thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven fat and full heads. Then Pharaoh woke up, and behold, {it was} a dream.

Then the thin heads of grain
“Next, the small/shriveled heads of grain”. See how you translated “thin” in verse 6 and “heads of grain” in verses 5-6.

swallowed up
“swallowed down” or “ate/gobbled up/down” or “devoured”. See how you translated a different Hebrew word that has a similar meaning (“ate {up/down}”) in verse 4.

the seven fat and full heads.
“the seven big/plump, well-formed heads.” The word “full” here describes heads of grain that have many seeds in them. See how you translated “fat” in verse 5.

Then Pharaoh woke up,
“{Just} then Pharaoh woke up” or “After that, Pharaoh woke up” or “At that point, Pharaoh woke up”. See how you translated this in verse 4.

and behold, {it was} a dream.
“and {suddenly} realized/knew that {he had been} dreaming.”

Gen 41:8 Then it happened in the morning that his spirit was agitated, so he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt and all its wise men. Then Pharaoh told his dreams to them, but no one could interpret them for Pharaoh.

Then it happened in the morning that
“In the morning” or “The next morning”. The phrase “Then it happened” introduces and emphasizes an important event. It also increases suspense so that the audience wonders what the outcome will be. Many English translations do not include this phrase, possibly for reasons of naturalness. Do what is natural in your language.

his spirit was agitated,
“his/Pharaoh’s spirit/mind was disturbed/troubled {about what the dreams might mean},” or “Pharaoh was/felt upset/distressed {about the/his dreams},”

so he sent and called for
“so he sent {servants/messengers} to summon” or “so he had {servants/messengers} summon”

all the magicians of Egypt and all its wise men.
“all the magicians/sorcerers and {other} wise men in {the country of} Egypt {to come to him}.” Magicians were some of the wise men whom Pharaoh regularly consulted for advice. They had power from demons to do miracles (Exodus 7:11, 22; 8:7) and to communicate with the spirits of people who had died. They may have also been astrologers, or Egyptian priests who were skilled in sacred writings. Some of that information could be put in a footnote.

Then Pharaoh told his dreams to them,
“{When they arrived,} Pharaoh/he told them what he had dreamed,” or “Then Pharaoh/he related/described to them what {he had seen} in his dreams,”

but no one
“but none of them” or “but none of those men”

could interpret them for Pharaoh.
“was able to explain to him {what} the dreams {meant}.” or “could tell him what the dreams meant.”


Gen 41:9 Then the chief of the cupbearers spoke with Pharaoh, saying, “Today I remember my offenses. 

Then the chief of the cupbearers
“Then/But the head wine-server”. Consider again how you translated “chief of the cupbearers” and “cupbearer” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 40:1-2, 5, 9, 13, 20-21, 23; 41:9.

spoke with Pharaoh, saying, 
“spoke {up} and said to Pharaoh,” or “said to Pharaoh,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Today I remember 
“{Sir,} today I remember” or “{Your Majesty/Honor,} I now remember”. For many languages, it is necessary to use a respectful title to address a person of high status like Pharaoh. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-honorifics)

my offenses.
“my sins/failures.” The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean (1) “{the time} when I offended/displeased/wronged {you}.” (2) “something {important} I failed/forgot to do.” The second interpretation refers to the cupbearer forgetting to tell Pharaoh about Joseph.


Gen 41:10 Pharaoh broke out in anger against his servants, and he put me in custody {in} the house of the chief of the guards, me and the chief of the bakers. 

Pharaoh broke out in anger against
“{Some time ago,} {King} Pharaoh, {you} were very angry at/with”. The events in verses 10-13 had happened two years earlier (verse 1); chapter 40 gives the details about those events. See how you translated the idiom “broke out in anger against” in Gen 40:2. (See: figs-explicit)

his servants, 
“his/your officials/officers,” In verses 10 and 13, the cupbearer uses third person (“Pharaoh....his....he...”) to show respect for Pharaoh. For some languages, it is confusing to do that, so second person (“you...your...you...”) must be used instead. Some languages have an honorific such as “your Majesty/Honor” that could be used occasionally in these verses instead of third person. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-123person)

and he put me in custody {in} the house of the chief of the guards, me and the chief of the bakers.
“{including} me and the chief/head baker, and he/you put us in custody/prison at the captain of the guards’ house.” or “and he/you put the head baker and me in the prison that is in the house of the captain of the guards.” See how you translated “put...in custody in the house of the chief of the guards” in Gen 40:3. Also consider again how you translated “chief of the bakers” and “baker” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 40:1-2, 4-5, 16-17, 20, 22; 41:10, 13.


Gen 41:11 And we dreamed a dream in the same night, he and I; each of us dreamed according to the interpretation of his dream. 

And we dreamed a dream in the same night, he and I;
“{One time while we were there,} we {each} dreamed/had a dream in/during the same night,” or “{While we were there,} one night we {each} had a dream,” See how you translated a similar sentence in Gen 40:5. In verses 11-13, the pronouns “we” and “us” exclude Pharaoh. (See: figs-exclusive)

each of us dreamed according to the interpretation of his dream.
“{and} each of our dreams had a different meaning.” or “{and} each of our dreams had its own meaning.” Consider again how you translated “interpretation” in Gen 40:5, 8, 12, 18; 41:11 and the related verb “interpret” in Gen 40:16, 22.


Gen 41:12 Now there with us {was} a young Hebrew man, a servant for the chief of the guards. And we told {our dreams} to him, and he interpreted our dreams for us; he interpreted {for} each according to his dream. 

Now there with us {was} a young Hebrew man,
“There was a young Hebrew man with us”. Translate “young...man” in a way that fits with the fact that Joseph was 30 years old (verse 46) and was not yet married.

a servant for the chief of the guards.
“{who was} a servant for the captain of/over the guards.” Consider again how you translated “chief of the guards” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 37:36; 39:1; 40:3-4; 41:10, 12.

And we told {our dreams} to him, and
“After we told him {our dreams},” or “After we related/described {our dreams} to him,” Consider again how you translated “told” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 24:66; 29:13; 37:9-10; 40:8-9; 41:8, 12.

he interpreted our dreams for us;
“he explained them to us.” or “he told us what they meant.”

he interpreted {for} each according to his dream.
“He interpreted each man’s dream.” or “He told each of us the meaning of our dreams.” or “He told us what each of our dreams meant.” 


Gen 41:13 And it happened, just as he interpreted for us, so it happened: me he restored to my position, and him he hanged.”

And it happened, just as he interpreted for us, so it happened:
“And sure enough, everything happened exactly the way he had interpreted/explained {the dreams} to us:”

me he restored to my position,
“you reinstated/reappointed/returned me to my {former/previous} position/work {as your cupbearer/wine-server},” See how you translated “restored to...position” in Gen 40:21.

and him he hanged.”
“and/but you {had your soldiers execute} the baker {and} hang/impale his body {on a pole/stake}.” or “but you {had your soldiers} execute the baker.” Consider again whether you referred to Pharaoh in third person (“he”) or second person (“you”) in verses 10 and 13. Also see how you translated “hanged/impaled {on a tree/pole}” in Gen 40:22. (See: figs-123person)

Gen 41:14 Then Pharaoh sent and called for Joseph. So they quickly brought him from the pit. Then he shaved and changed his clothes and came to Pharaoh. 

Then Pharaoh 
“{Immediately} Pharaoh” or “{When Pharaoh heard that,} {immediately} he”

sent and called for Joseph.
“sent {servants/messengers} to summon/get Joseph.” or “had {servants/messengers} summon Joseph.” See how you translated “sent and called for” in verse 8.

So they quickly 
“So they hurriedly” or “So they went right away and”

brought him from the pit.
“brought/got him/Joseph out of the dungeon/prison.” See how you translated “pit” in Gen 40:15.

Then he shaved and changed his clothes and
“Then he shaved {his head and face}, changed into suitable/better clothes and” or “Then after he shaved {his head and face} and changed into appropriate/clean clothing, he”. Since Joseph lived in Egypt and Egyptian men kept their heads and faces clean-shaven, Joseph probably also shaved his head and his face. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to make this implied information explicit in your translation. (See: figs-explicit)

came to Pharaoh.
“came/went before Pharaoh.” or “came/went into Pharaoh’s presence.” Your choice of “came” versus “went” in this context depends on whose perspective you take: “came” reflects things from Pharaoh’s point of view, and “went” reflects things from Joseph’s point of view. Do what is most natural in your language. (See: figs-go)


Gen 41:15 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I dreamed a dream, but no one could interpret it. But I heard about you, saying {that} you hear a dream {and are able} to interpret it.” 

Then Pharaoh said to Joseph,
“Then Pharaoh said to him,” or “Then Pharaoh told Joseph/him,” (See: writing-quotations)

“I dreamed a dream,
“I had a dream,” 

but no one could interpret it.
“but no one has been able to explain {to me} what it means.” or “but there isn’t anyone who can interpret/explain it {for/to me}.” See how you translated a similar clause in Gen 40:8.

But I heard about you, saying {that}
“But someone told me about you, that” or “But I was told that”

you hear a dream {and are able} to interpret it.”
“when you hear a dream, {you are able} to interpret/explain what it means.” or “when someone tells you a dream, {you are able} to interpret/explain its meaning.” Consider again how you translated “interpret” and “interpreter” throughout the book of Genesis. See Gen 40:8, 16, 22; 41:8, 12, 13, 15, 16.


Gen 41:16 And Joseph responded to Pharaoh, saying, “{It is} not in me; God will answer with Pharaoh’s peace.”

And Joseph responded to Pharaoh, saying,
“Joseph replied to Pharaoh/him,” (See: writing-quotations)

“{It is} not in me;
“{Sir,} I do not have that ability {on my own},” or “{Your Majesty,} I cannot do that {by myself},” Make sure your translation of Joseph’s response sounds polite. See what you did in verse 9. (See: figs-honorifics)

God will answer
“{but/rather} God will explain/interpret {your dream}” 

with Pharaoh’s peace.”
“for your well-being/good, {King} Pharaoh.” or “so that {you,} {King} Pharaoh, will have peace {in your heart/spirit}.” Consider whether or not it is more natural in your language to use Pharaoh’s name at the beginning of this quote (instead of here) and say, “{King} Pharaoh, I do not have that ability...” (See: figs-infostructure)

“As I was dreaming, I saw myself standing” or “I dreamed that I was standing”

on the bank of the River.
“on the bank of the {Nile} River.” or “beside the {Nile} River.” See how you translated “the {Nile} River” in verse 1. Since this is the first time that Pharaoh mentions “the River” to Joseph, consider whether this is a good place in your translation to make it explicit again that this is the Nile River. (See: figs-explicit)


Gen 41:18 Then behold, from the River came up seven cows, fat-fleshed and of fine form, and they grazed among the reeds. 

Then behold,
“Then suddenly,” or “Then I saw that”. Compare how you translated verse 2, which is similar, but not identical, to verse 18.

from the River came up seven cows, fat-fleshed and of fine form,
“seven cows {that were} fat and healthy-looking came/walked up out of the river {onto the bank/land}” or “seven fat/well-fed, healthy-looking cows came/walked up out of the river {onto the bank/land}” (See: figs-infostructure)

seven other cows came up after them,
“seven other cows came/walked up {out of the river} behind the first cows;”

poor and very ugly of form and thin-fleshed.
“they were in terrible/horrible condition, very sickly-looking and scrawny/skinny.” For some languages it is more natural to put this information earlier in this sentence and say, “Then behold, seven poor/weak, very sickly-looking, scrawny cows came up {out of the river} behind the first cows/ones.” Do what is best in your language.

scorched by the east wind.
“that the {hot/dry} east/desert wind had dried out/up.” or “that the {desert} wind from the east had dried out/up.” See how you translated this phrase in verses 6 and 23.

It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.

There will be seven years of famine.
“{They both mean that} there will be a famine that lasts seven years.” or “{Both dreams mean that} there will be seven years when food will be very/extremely scarce.” A “famine” is a prolonged period of time when people are starving because crops are failing, often due to a lack of rain or other severe weather conditions.

Gen 41:29 Behold, seven years are coming {of} great abundance in all the land of Egypt.

Behold, seven years are coming
“Listen, {first} there will be seven years”

{of} great abundance 
“when crops/harvests are abundant” or “when people will have more than enough food {to eat}” or “when everyone will have plenty of food {to eat}”

in all the land of Egypt.
“throughout the entire/whole land/country of Egypt.”


Gen 41:30 But seven years of famine will rise up after them, so that all the abundance in the land of Egypt will be forgotten, and the famine will consume the land.

But seven years of famine will rise up after them, 
“But after them/that, there will be a famine that lasts seven years,” or “But after those {prosperous} years, there will be seven years when food is very/extremely scarce,” See how you translated “famine” in verse 27.

so that all the abundance in the land of Egypt will be forgotten, 
“So people/everyone in the country of Egypt will forget how good it was during the time/years when they had plenty of food,” or “As a result, the people in Egypt will forget what it was like in their country during all the years when they had more than enough {food} {to eat},” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

and the famine 
“because the famine” or “because the severe food shortage” 

will consume the land. 
will devastate/destroy the land/country {and the people}.” or “will devastate/ravage the land/country {so that many people will starve}.” The phrase “the land” here probably also includes the people who lived in that country. (See: figs-metonymy)


Gen 41:31 And the abundance in the land will not be remembered because of that famine after it, because it {will be} very heavy.

And 
“That’s right,” or “Yes/Indeed,” Verse 31 restates much of the content of verse 30, so keep that it mind as you translate the beginning of this verse. (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)

the abundance in the land will not be remembered 
“people will completely forget about the time/years when food was plentiful,” or “there will be no evidence/trace left that there were years when there was more than enough food”

because of that famine after it, because it {will be} very heavy.
“because the famine {that comes/happens} after that {will be} very/so severe/oppressive.” or “because the following years when food is scarce {will be} so severe/terrible.” For some languages, it clearer and more natural to put this clause near the beginning of this verse and say, “Yes, the famine that is coming will be so severe/terrible that people will completely forget about the time/years when food was abundant/plentiful in the land.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 41:32 And as for the repeating of the dream to Pharaoh twice, {it is} because the matter has been established by God, and God will soon do it.

And as for the repeating of the dream to Pharaoh twice, {it is} because 
“The reason you dreamed/had the same dream in two different ways/forms is that” or “The fact that you, {King} Pharaoh, had two {different} dreams that mean the same thing shows that” (See: figs-123person)

the matter has been established by God, 
“God has {firmly} decided/determined what he is going to do,” or “God wants you to know that this will {definitely} happen,” 

and God will soon do it.
“and he will make it happen soon.” or “and he will cause it to happen {very} soon.”

And under Pharaoh’s hand, 
“Under Pharaoh’s/your direction,” or “Under/Using your authority, {King} Pharaoh,” Consider again how you translated the use of the third person to address Pharaoh respectfully in verses 10, 13, 25, 32-35. (See: figs-123person)

Make sure the way you translated “{the people of /in} the land/country” at the beginning of this verse fits with how you translate it here. It is helpful to read your translation aloud to make sure it is clear and natural. (See: writing-pronouns)

“the severe food scarcity/shortage.” or “the severe lack of food.”


41:37-57 Joseph Is Appointed As The Governor Of Egypt And Stores Up Grain
 
Gen 41:37 And the word was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants.

And the word was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants.
“What Joseph said/proposed seemed like a good plan to Pharaoh and all his servants/officials.” or “Pharaoh and all his servants/officials agreed that what Joseph had said/proposed was good.” See how you translated the idiom “in the eyes of” in Gen 34:18. (See: figs-idiom)


Gen 41:38 Then Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find a man like this who {has} the Spirit of God in him?”

Then Pharaoh said to his servants, 
“So Pharaoh said to his officials,” or “So Pharaoh exclaimed to them,”

“Can we find a man like this
“{Certainly} we cannot find anyone else more qualified than this man,” or “{It is obvious that} we will never find a man as qualified as this/Joseph,” Pharaoh uses a rhetorical question here to emphasize that no one is more qualified than Joseph. Consider whether it is better in your language to translate this quote using a question or a statement. (See: figs-rquestion)

who {has} the Spirit of God in him?”
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean (1) “who has God’s Spirit in him” or “whom God’s Spirit guides” (2) “who has a divine spirit in him” or “who has a spirit of {the} gods in him”. Most translations follow the first interpretation, since Joseph had just talked to Pharaoh about God (verses 16, 28, 32) and Pharaoh acknowledges God in verse 39.
 

Gen 41:39 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has shown all this to you, {there is} no one {as} discerning and wise as you.

Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, 
“Then he said to Joseph,” or “Then Pharaoh/he {turned} to Joseph and said,”

“Since God has shown all this to you, 
“Since God has made all this known to you,” or “God has revealed to you what he is going to do, so”

{there is} no one {as} discerning 
“no one {else} is {as} intelligent/insightful as you {are}”. See how you translated “discerning and wise” in verse 33.

and wise as you.
“or knows what to do {in this situation}.” or “or can decide wisely about how to manage {this situation}.”


Gen 41:40 You will be over my house, and all my people will kiss on your mouth. Only I {on} the throne will be greater than you.”

You will be over my house, 
“{So} I am putting you in charge of my household {and my kingdom/country},” or “{So} I am giving you authority over {the people in} my palace {and the rest of my kingdom/country},” The phrase “my house” refers here to Pharaoh’s household and all the other people he rules as king. (See: figs-metonymy)

and all my people 
“so that all the people in my country/kingdom” or “so that all the people I reign over” 

will kiss on your mouth.
“must obey/do whatever you say/command.” or “will/must respect and obey whatever you tell them to do.” Consider whether you have a similar idiom in your language, or if you need to say this without an idiom. (See: figs-idiom)

Only I {on} the throne 
“Only I {who sit} {on} the throne {as king}” or “Only I who am king”. In this context, “the throne” refers to Pharaoh’s position as the king. Make sure that is clear in your translation. (See: figs-metonymy)

will be greater than you.”
“will have higher/more authority than you.”


Gen 41:41 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “See, I have put you over all the land of Egypt.” 

Then Pharaoh said to Joseph,
“Then Pharaoh said,” or “Pharaoh continued/added,” Some languages leave “Joseph” or even this entire quote margin implied here, since Pharaoh is still talking to the same person. Do what is best in your language. (See: writing-quotations)

“See, I have put you over
“Look/Listen, I hereby/now put you in charge of” or “I am now appointing/installing you to be {the manager/supervisor} over”. The word “See” emphasizes what Pharaoh says next.

all the land of Egypt.”
“the whole/entire land/country of Egypt.”


Gen 41:42 Then Pharaoh removed his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph’s hand. And he dressed him {in} garments of fine linen and put a gold chain on his neck.

Then Pharaoh removed his signet ring from his hand 
“Then Pharaoh/he took off his {official/royal} identification ring” or “Then Pharaoh took from his finger the ring that he used to mark/seal {documents/letters}”. The signet ring was the identification ring that the king used to seal official documents. See how you translated “signet” in Gen 38:18. (See: translate-unknown)

and put it on Joseph’s hand. 
“and put it on Joseph’s finger {to show that he had appointed him}.” or “and placed it on Joseph’s finger {showing he now had Pharaoh’s authority}”. The signet ring showed that Joseph represented Pharaoh and had his complete authority. (See: translate-symaction)

And he dressed him {in} garments of fine linen
“He also had Joseph put on fine/expensive linen clothes/robes” or “He {also} gave Joseph high-quality/expensive clothes/robes to wear”. The Hebrew word for “fine linen” refers to a special kind of white cloth that was woven out of flax and had a fine texture. Clothes made from linen were expensive and were worn by the king and high officials. If linen is not known in your language area, you could be more general and refer to expensive, high-quality clothes. (See: translate-unknown)

and put a gold chain on his neck. 
“and put a chain/collar {made} of gold around his neck.” or “and put around his neck a chain/necklace {made} of gold.”


Gen 41:43 Then he had him ride in the second chariot that {belonged} to him, and they shouted before him, “Bow down!” So he put him over all the land of Egypt.

Then he had him ride 
“Then Pharaoh had Joseph ride {around}”

in the second chariot that {belonged} to him, 
“in a royal {horse-drawn} chariot/cart as his second-in-command” or “in the {horse-drawn} chariot/cart that showed he was the second highest ruler in the country.” A chariot is a cart with two or four wheels that was pulled by one or more horses. It was used as transportation and was especially used in battles. Translate this in a way that fits with this description. It may be helpful to include a picture of a chariot in your translation. (See: translate-symaction)

and they shouted before him,
“{As he rode,} heralds/messengers {walked} {in the road/streets} ahead of him calling out {to everyone},” Make sure the way you translate “shouted” does not sound angry. Rather they were calling out loudly enough for people to hear them.

“Bow down!”
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. 1. It could be a transliteration of an Egyptian word that means, “Bow down {in reverence/respect}!” or “Make way {for the king’s appointed one}!” or “Welcome/Honor {your new leader}!”, which is what people would be told to do to honor an important person; 2. It could be a combination of Hebrew words that means, “{This is} {the} father of {the} king!” which is similar to what Joseph says in Gen 45:8. (See: translate-symaction)

So he put him over
“So Pharaoh put Joseph in charge of” or “In that way, Pharaoh {officially} appointed/installed Joseph to be {the manager/supervisor} over/of”. See how you translated a similar sentence in verse 41.

all the land of Egypt.
“the whole/entire land/country of Egypt.”

__________________Paragraph Break__________________ 
 
Gen 41:44 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I {am} Pharaoh, and without you a person will not lift his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt!”

“Pharaoh {also} told Joseph,”

“I {am} Pharaoh, and 
“I, Pharaoh, {hereby command/decree} that”

without you a person will not lift his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt!” 
“no one throughout the whole/entire country of Egypt may do anything unless you tell them to do it!” or “throughout the whole/entire country of Egypt, everyone must only do what you tell them to do!” The phrase “will not lift his hand or foot” is hyperbole (exaggeration) that is used to emphasize joseph’s authority. Consider whether or not it is clear and natural to do that here in your language. (See: figs-hyperbole)


Gen 41:45 Then Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphenath-Paneah, and he gave to him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera the priest of On, as a wife. Then Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.

Then Pharaoh called Joseph’s name 
“Then Pharaoh called Joseph by the {Egyptian} name” or “Then Pharaoh gave Joseph the {Egyptian} name”

Zaphenath-Paneah,
“Zaphenath-Paneah {which means “explainer/revealer of secrets”},” or “Zaphenath-Paneah {which means “the one who explains/reveals secrets”},” (See: translate-names)

and he gave to him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera the priest of On, as a wife. 
“and he gave him {a woman named} Asenath to be {his} wife. {She was} the daughter of Potiphera, {who was} a priest {at the temple} in/at {the city of} On.” Potiphera was a pagan priest, who led people in worshiping the Egyptians’ gods, not Yahweh. See how you translated “priest” in Gen 14:18.

Then Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.
“Then Joseph started going/traveling around all over the land/country of Egypt.” or “Then Joseph {started his duties/work and} traveled throughout the land/country of Egypt.”

Gen 41:47 And in the seven years of abundance, the land produced {grain} by the handfuls.

And in the seven years of abundance, 
“During the seven years when food was abundant/plentiful,” or “For seven years the crops/harvests were abundant/plentiful and”. Compare how you translated “seven years of abundance” in verse 34.

the land produced {grain} by the handfuls.
“the land produced huge/large amounts of grain.” or “the people harvested huge/large amounts of grain from the land.” The idiom “by the handfuls” refers here to large amounts of grain. Consider whether your language has a similar idiom you could use here. (See: figs-idiom)


Gen 41:48 So he gathered all the food of the seven years that were in the land of Egypt, and he put the food in the cities. The food of the fields that surrounded {each} city he put inside it.

So he gathered 
“So Joseph {told the supervisors/administrators under him} to gather/collect” or “So Joseph {had his helpers} gather/collect”. When the Bible says that a leader such as Joseph did something, it often means that he had it done by people under his authority. Decide whether you want to include this information in your translation or in a footnote. (See: figs-explicit)

all the food of the seven years that were in the land of Egypt,
“all the {extra/surplus} food/grain that was produced/harvested in the land/country of Egypt during {those} seven years,” or “all the {extra/surplus} grain {that people harvested/produced} during {those} seven years in the land/country of Egypt,” See how you translated “all the food” in verse 35.

and he put the food in the cities.
“and he {had them} store/stockpile {that} grain in the cities.”

The food of the fields that surrounded {each} city he put inside it.
“The food/grain {that people had harvested} from the fields, he {had his supervisors/helpers} store/stockpile in the nearby cities.” or “In each city he {had them} store/stockpile the food/grain {that people had harvested} from the surrounding/nearby fields.” Consider what phrase order is best for this sentence in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 41:49 So Joseph stored up grain like the sand of the sea, very much, until he stopped measuring {it} because it was without number.

So Joseph stored up 
“In that way, Joseph stockpiled” or “Joseph {had his helpers} store up”. See how you translated “store/stockpile” in verse 35.

grain like 
“so much grain that it was/seemed/looked as {plentiful as}” 

the sand of the sea, 
“{grains of} sand beside the sea/ocean.” or “the {grains of} sand on the seashore.” See how you translated “as the sand of the sea” in Gen 32:12 and a similar phrase in Gen 22:17.

very much, until
“{In fact,} there was so much that” or “{In fact,} it was so plentiful that {after a while}”

he stopped measuring {it}
“he {had them} stop keeping records/track {of it}” or “he/they had to stop writing down how much there was,” It was probably Joseph’s helpers who measured the grain and kept records of it. See how you handled this at the beginning of this verse. 

because it was without number.
“because {there was so much that} he could no longer measure/record it.” or “because it was too much to keep track of.”

“Before the {seven} famine years started,” or “Now {it so happened that} before the {seven} years of famine came/started,” Consider the best way to change topics and begin this new paragraph in your language. (See: writing-newevent)

two sons were born to Joseph, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, the priest of On, bore for him. 
“Joseph had two sons with {his wife} Asenath, a daughter of Potiphera, {who was} a priest in {the city of} On.” or “Joseph and {his wife} Asenath had two sons. {Remember that} Asenath was a daughter of Potiphera, a priest {in the city} of On.” See how you translated “Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, the priest of On” in verse 45.

“because the food shortage was {so} severe/terrible throughout the entire/whole world.” For some languages it is clearer or more natural to put this clause near the beginning of verse 57 and say, “In fact, the famine was/became so severe/terrible in/throughout the entire/whole world that {people} started coming/traveling to Egypt from all over the world to buy {grain} from Joseph.” Do what is best in your language. See how you translated “severe/terrible” in verse 56. (See: figs-infostructure)

42:1-38 Joseph’s Brothers Come To Egypt To Buy Grain

Gen 42:1 Then Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, so Jacob said to his sons, “Why are you looking at each other?”

Then 
“Meanwhile {in the land/region of Canaan},” This verse begins a new episode which overlaps in time with some of what was happening in chapter 41. Consider what is the best way to begin this episode in your language. (See: writing-newevent)

Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, so
“when Jacob heard/learned that there was grain {for sale} in {the country of} Egypt,” or “when Jacob found out that {he/they could buy} grain in Egypt,”

Jacob said to his sons,
“he asked/told his sons,”

“Why are you looking at each other?”
“What are you waiting for?” or “Do not {just stand/sit here} looking/staring at each other!” or “Do not just {stand around/there} doing nothing!” Jacob uses this rhetorical question to get his sons to take action and do what he says next. Consider the best way to communicate that in your language. (See: figs-rquestion)


Gen 42:2 And he said, “Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy {some} for us from there so that we will live and not die.”

And he said, 
“Then he continued/added,” For some languages it is more natural to omit the quote margin here, because the same person (Jacob) is still talking to the same people (his sons). Do what is best in your language. (See: writing-quotations)

“Behold, 
“Listen {to this}!” or “Look,”

I have heard 
“I heard/learned” or “Someone told me”
   
that there is grain in Egypt.
“that there is {much} grain {for sale} in {the country of} Egypt.” or “that {the country of} Egypt has {a lot of} grain {that people can buy}.”

Go down there 
“{So} {I want/need you to} go/travel there” or “{So} {please} go/travel down there”. Make sure that the way you translate Jacob’s command to his sons does not sound rude or harsh. (See: figs-politeness)

and buy {some} for us from there 
“and buy {some} {grain} for us {all}” or “and buy {some} for us {and our families} {to eat}”

so that we will live 
“so that we will/can survive” or “so that we will/can stay alive”

and not die.”
“and not die {from hunger}.” or “and not starve to death.”


Gen 42:3 Then ten of Joseph’s brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.

Then ten of Joseph’s brothers 
“Then/So Joseph’s ten {older} brothers”. These ten brothers were older than Joseph and had different mothers than he did. (See: translate-kinship)

went down to buy grain from Egypt. 
“{left home/Canaan and} went/traveled down to Egypt to buy {some} grain {there}.” The verb “went down” refers to the fact that Egypt was lower in elevation than the land of Canaan. It is also located southwest of Canaan. See how you translated “go down” in verse 2 and “went down” in Gen 12:10.


Gen 42:4 But Jacob did not send Benjamin, the brother of Joseph, with his brothers, because he said, “So that harm does not meet him!”

But Jacob did not send Benjamin, the brother of Joseph, 
“But Jacob did not send Joseph’s {younger} brother Benjamin {to Egypt}” or “But Jacob did not allow/permit Joseph’s {younger} brother to go {to Egypt}”. Benjamin was younger than Joseph and had the same mother (Rachel) and father. (See: translate-kinship)

with his brothers, 
“with his {other} brothers,” or “with {the rest of} his brothers,”

because he said, “So that harm does not meet him!”
“because he/Jacob thought that he/Benjamin might be harmed.” or “because he/Jacob was afraid/concerned that something bad/terrible might happen to him.” For some languages it is more natural to put this clause first in this verse and say, “But Jacob was concerned that harm might come to Joseph’s {younger} brother Benjamin, so he did not send him with {the rest of} his brothers {to Egypt}.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-quotations)

The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean {1) “the country {of Egypt}” as it does earlier in verse 6; or it can mean (2) “the earth/world.”

So the brothers of Joseph 
“So/Then Joseph’s brothers”

came and bowed down to him {with} {their} noses to the ground.
“{also} came/went before him {like everyone else} and bowed down {with} {their} faces/foreheads to/toward the ground {to show him respect}.” or “{also} came/went {to him} and prostrated themselves before him {to show respect}.” See how you translated “bow down” in Gen 37:7, 9-10.

Gen 42:7 And Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he acted like a stranger to them, and he spoke with them harshly and said to them, “Where did you come from?” And they said, “From the land of Canaan to buy food.”

And Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them,
“When Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them” or “Joseph immediately recognized his brothers”

but he acted like a stranger to them, 
“but he treated them like strangers” or “But he pretended that/like he did not {know} {them}”. For some languages it is better to divide the first sentence in this verse into shorter sentences. Do what is best in your language.

“and spoke to them in a harsh/stern way/manner” or “In fact, he spoke to them sternly/roughly”. Consider whether or not it is more natural to begin a new sentence here in your language. 

and said to them,
“and asked/questioned them,” or “and demanded,”

“Where did you come from?”
“Where are you from?” or “What country are you from?”

And they said, 
“They answered {him},” (See: writing-quotations)

“From the land of Canaan 
“{Sir,} {we came/are} from the land/region of Canaan”. For some languages it is necessary to begin with a respectful title or form of address when someone talks to a person of high status like Joseph. See how Joseph’s brothers address him in verse 10. (See: figs-honorifics)

“spying {on} {their} country!” or “being spies!”


Gen 42:31 But we said to him, ‘We {are} honest. We are not spies.

But we said to him, ‘We {are} honest. We are not spies.
“But we told him, ‘We {are} trustworthy {men}; not spies.” or “We told him that we are not spies, but rather honest/trustworthy {men}.” Consider whether it is more natural in your language to translate this embedded quote as a direct or indirect quote. Also, see how you translated “...honest...not spies” in verse 11. (See: figs-quotesinquotes)

Then bring your youngest brother to me 
“Then/But bring your youngest brother {back} {here} to me” or “After that, you must come back {here} to me with your youngest brother.” See how you translated a similar clause at the beginning of verse 20.

Gen 42:37 Then Reuben said to his father, saying, “You may kill my two sons if I do not bring him to you. Put him in my hand, and I will return him to you.”

Then Reuben said to his father, saying,
“Then Reuben said/responded to his father,” or “Reuben replied,” (See: writing-quotations)

“You may kill my two sons if I do not bring him to you. 
“You may punish me by killing my sons if I do not bring Benjamin back to you.” or “If I fail to bring Benjamin/him {back} to you {safely}, you can {punish me by} killing my two sons.” For some languages, it is necessary to change the order of clauses in this sentence (so that the condition comes first), as in the second alternate above. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

Put him in my hand, 
“Entrust him/Benjamin to my care {as we travel to Egypt},” or “Let me be responsible for {taking care of} him/Benjamin {on our trip to Egypt},” The phrase “in my hand” is used here as an idiom that means that Reuben was going to be responsible for Benjamin’s welfare. (See: figs-idiom)

and I will return him to you.”
“and {I promise that} I will bring him back to you {safely}.” For some languages it is more natural to change the order of clauses in this quote and say, “{Father,} let me be responsible for {taking} Benjamin {down to Egypt}. If I fail to bring him {back} to you {safely}, you can {punish me by} killing my two sons.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 42:38 But he said, “My son will not go down with you, because his brother is dead and he alone is left. And {if} harm were to meet him on the road that you are going on, then you would bring my gray head down in sorrow to Sheol!”

But he said, 
“But his father replied/insisted,” (See: writing-quotations)

“My son will not go down with you,
“My son {Benjamin} will/may not go with you {to Egypt}” or “{No,} I will not let my son {Benjamin} go down {to Egypt} with you”. Notice that the pronoun “you” is plural in this verse. Also, see how you translated “go down” in verse 2.

because his brother is dead
“His brother is dead,” Joseph was Benjamin’s older brother from the same father and mother. Consider whether your language has a special kinship term for that. Also consider whether or not it is better to begin a new sentence here in your language. (See: translate-kinship)

and he alone is left.
“so he is the only one {of his mother’s sons} {who is} still alive.” or “and/so he is the only one/son {I have} left {from his mother}.” You could include a footnote here that explains that Joseph and Benjamin were the only two sons of Rachel, Jacob’s favorite wife who died after giving birth to Benjamin (Gen 35:16-20).

And {if} harm were to meet him on the road that you are going on,
“And/So if he were to be harmed/killed during your journey,” or “So if anything bad happened to him while you are traveling,” Jacob is saying what would happen if he lost Benjamin too. Consider how to best translate this hypothetical statement in your language. Also, see how you translated “harm...meet him” in verse 4. (See: figs-hypo)

then you would bring my gray head down in sorrow 
“you would cause me, your gray-haired/elderly father, to grieve so deeply/badly that I would {die and} go down” or “you would cause me, your gray-haired/elderly father, so much sorrow/grief that I would {die and} go down”. The phrase “my gray head” is a synecdoche which Jacob uses to refer to himself as their aged father. Consider whether your language has a similar phrase that is natural and works well here. (See: figs-synecdoche)

to Sheol!”
“to the afterworld!” The Hebrew term “Sheol” is the name of the place where the spirits of people went after they died. If you transliterate the name “Sheol” in your translation, you could put its meaning in a footnote. See how you translated this term in Gen 37:35, and see the note about that there.

43:1-34 Joseph’s Brothers, Including Benjamin, Return To The Country Of Egypt

Gen 43:1 Now the famine {was} heavy in the land. 

Now the famine 
“The famine” or “The food shortage”. The setting changes here to focus on what is happening in Canaan. Some languages use a special conjunction (like “Now”) to indicate that, while others do not use a conjunction here. Do what is best in your language. (See: grammar-connect-time-background)

{was} heavy 
“{was} oppressive/severe” or “{continued to be} severe”. The word “heavy” is used here as an idiom that means the famine caused everyone much suffering. See how you translated the same idiom in Gen 12:10 and Gen 41:31. (See: figs-idiom)

in the land.
“in the land/region {of Canaan}.”


Gen 43:2 So it happened when they finished eating the grain that they had brought from Egypt, then their father said to them, “Return, buy a little food for us.”

So it happened
“So it happened {that}” or “So”. This phrase introduces an important event and helps create suspense so that readers will wonder what the outcome will be. Many translations omit “it happened” because it is not natural in their language. Do what is best in your language.

when they 
“when Jacob and his family”. Consider whether it is clearer in your language to use a pronoun or a noun phrase here. (See: writing-pronouns)

finished eating 
“{had} finished eating” or “had used/eaten up”

“sternly warned/told us” or “was serious when he warned us”

You will not see my face

“unless our {youngest} brother is with us!” or “if our {youngest} brother {is} not with us!” Make sure that the way you translate this clause fits with how you translated the previous part of this sentence. (See: figs-quotesinquotes)


Gen 43:4 If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy food for you. 

If you will send our brother with us, 
“{So} if you will allow/permit our {youngest} brother to go with us,” or “{So} if you will let our {youngest} brother go with us,” In verses 3-5, the pronouns “us” and “we” are exclusive since they do not include Jacob (whom Judah is talking to). (See: figs-exclusive)

“Why did you treat me badly by telling
“Why did you cause trouble/distress for me by telling” or “You caused me a lot of trouble/distress because you told”. Jacob uses a rhetorical question here to scold his sons and to show how upset he is. Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language. (See: figs-rquestion)

Gen 43:7 And they said, “The man asked persistently about us and our relatives, saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Do you have {another} brother?’ And we answered him according to those words. How could we possibly know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down’?”

And they said,
“They answered {him},” (See: writing-quotations)
 
“The man asked persistently 
“The man/governor questioned {us} intensely/thoroughly” or “The man asked {us} many questions” 

about us and our relatives, saying,
“about ourselves and about {the rest of} our family.” In verses 7-8, the pronouns “us”, “our” and “we” are exclusive since they do not include Jacob (whom the sons are talking to). (See: figs-exclusive)

‘Is your father still alive? Do you have {another} brother?’ 
“He {specifically} asked {us} if/whether our father was still alive and if/whether we had {another} brother.” Consider whether it is more natural in your language to translate this embedded quote with a direct or indirect quote. (See: figs-quotesinquotes)

And we answered him according to those words. 
“So we {just/simply} answered his questions {honestly/truthfully}.” or “All we did was answer his questions.”

How could we possibly know 
 “We could not possibly have known” or “There is no way we could have known”. Jacob’s sons use a rhetorical question here to emphasize their innocence and express strong emotion. Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language. (See: figs-rquestion)

that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down’?”
“that he would tell/require us to take our brother down {there} {to him}!” If you translate this rhetorical question as a statement, make sure that you end it with a period or exclamation mark.

 Gen 43:8 Then Judah said to Israel his father, “Send the young man with me, and we will get up and go so that both we and you and our little ones will live and not die. 

Then Judah said to Israel his father, 
“Then Judah urged his father Israel {about Benjamin},” For some languages it is necessary to make “Benjamin” explicit here in the quote margin so that it is clear that “young man” refers to him in the following quote. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-explicit)

“Send the young man with me, 
“Allow/Permit the young man to come with me/us {and I will watch over him}” or “Entrust the young man to me {to take care of}”. See how you translated “young man” in Gen 37:2; 41:12. Use a term here in your language that fits with the fact that Benjamin was probably in his 30’s.

“The servant did exactly what Joseph {had} told/commanded {him to do}”

and the man brought 
“and took/led” or “and escorted”

the men to Joseph’s house. 
“the brothers to Joseph’s house.” Make sure that the way you translate this phrase does not sound like Joseph’s brothers went inside the house yet. They did not actually go inside until later (verse 24). 


Gen 43:18 And the men were afraid when they were brought {to} Joseph’s house, and they said, “Because of the matter of the silver that was returned in our sacks the first time, we have been brought. {He wants} to roll himself over us and throw himself on us and take us as slaves, and our donkeys!”

And the men were afraid when they were brought {to} Joseph’s house,
“The brothers became afraid when/because they saw that the servant had brought/led them {to} Joseph’s house,” or “But when the brothers saw that he had taken them to Joseph’s house, they were afraid,”

and they said, 
“and they said {to each other},” or “Then they said {to each other},” Consider whether or not it is more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here.

“Because of the matter of the silver that was returned in our sacks the first time, we have been brought.
“We have been brought {here} because of the silver/money that was returned {to us} in our sacks the first time {we came here}.” or “He has brought/taken us here because of {our} silver/money that someone gave back to us in our sacks {on} {our} first trip {here}.” (See: figs-infostructure)

{He wants} to roll himself over us and throw himself on us 
“{He is planning} to take/seize us by force” or “{He intends} to {have his soldiers} attack us and overpower us”. Consider the best way to translate these idioms in your language. (See: figs-idiom)

and take us as slaves, 
“and keep us as slaves/servants” or “and make us {his} slaves/servants”

and our donkeys!”
“along with our donkeys!” or “{He will} also {take/capture} our donkeys!”

Then they went near to 
“Then/So they went up to” or “Then/So they approached”

the man who {was} over Joseph’s house 
“the servant who managed/supervised Joseph’s household” or “Joseph’s head house-servant”. See how you translated a similar phrase in verse 16.

and spoke to him {at} the entrance of the house. 
“to speak to him {at/outside} the entrance/door to {his} house.” or “{at/outside} the entrance/door to the house in order to speak to him.”


Gen 43:20 And they said, “Please, my lord, we surely came down {here} the first time to buy food. 

And they said,
“They said {to him},” or “{One of} them said {to him} {on behalf of them all},” (See: writing-quotations)

“Please, my lord, 
“Excuse me/us, sir,” or “Master/Sir, please {allow me/us to speak to you}.” The brothers are asking the servant for permission to speak. Translate this in a way that is respectful in your language. (See: figs-honorifics)

we surely came down {here} the first time to buy food. 
“the first/previous time we came/traveled down {here} {to Egypt}, we came to buy {some} food/grain.” or “one time before this, we traveled all the way down {here} {to Egypt} and bought {some} food/grain.”


Gen 43:21 But it happened when we came to the lodging place, we opened our sacks and behold, {each} man’s silver {was} in the mouth of his sack; our silver {was there} in its {full} weight! So we have brought it back in our hands. 

But it happened 
“But it {so} happened {that}” or “But {on our way home}”. This phrase introduces an important event and helps create suspense so that readers will wonder what the outcome will be. Many translations omit “it happened” because it is not natural in their language. Do what is best in your language.
   
when we came to the lodging place, we opened our sacks
“when we arrived at the place where we lodged/stayed for the night, we opened our sacks”. See how you translated “the lodging place” in Gen 42:27.

and behold, {each} man’s silver {was} in the mouth of his sack;
“and we were surprised to see that our bags/pouches of silver/money were in the opening/top of each of our sacks!” or “There in the opening/top of each of our sacks {was} the silver/money {we had paid/given to you} {for the grain}!” See how you translated “in the mouth of...sacks” in verse 12. (See: figs-idiom)

our silver {was there} in its {full} weight! 
“The full/exact weight/amount of silver/money was there!” or “The silver/money was all there!” The silver was weighed in shekels (Gen 20:16; 23:15-16; 37:28) to determine how much to pay for something. See how you translated “silver” in Gen 42:25, 27, 35. (See: translate-bmoney)

So we have brought it back 
“So/But we brought it {all} back” or “So/But we brought {all} that silver/money back”

“with us”

to buy food.
“so that we can buy {some more} food/grain {now/today}.”

We do not know 
“We have no idea”

who put our silver in our sacks.”
“who put the money in our sacks.” or “who gave that silver/money back to us in our sacks.” or “how our silver/money got into our sacks {like that}.”


Gen 43:23 But he said, “Peace {be} to you, do not be afraid. Your God and the God of your father has given you hidden treasure in your sacks; your silver came to me.” Then he brought Simeon out to them.

But he said, 
“But Joseph’s servant said/replied {to them},”

“Peace {be} to you, 
“Be at peace,” or “All is well for you,” or “It/Everything is all right,” The phrase “Peace to you” is a blessing that wishes someone to be well and at peace. Consider whether your language has a similar blessing or possibly an idiom that would work well here.

do not be afraid.
“do not be anxious.” or “do not worry {about it}.”

Your God and the God of your father 
“Your God, {who is} also your father’s God” or “The God whom you and your father serve/worship”. Make sure that your translation of these phrases refers to the same God, not two different Gods.

“must have hidden/put the silver/money in your sacks,”

your silver came to me.”
“{because} I {definitely} received your/the silver/money {that you paid for the grain}.” or “{because} {I know that} you gave/paid me silver/money {to pay for the grain}.”

Then he brought Simeon out to them.
“Then the/Joseph’s head-servant brought Simeon out {of prison} to his brothers.” or “Then the/Joseph’s servant {got} Simeon out {of prison} {and} brought/took {him} to his brothers.”

“and provided {them} with water”

and they washed their feet, 
“and they washed {the dust/dirt off} their feet,” or “to wash {the road dust off} their feet,” Consider again how you translated “wash....feet” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 18:4; 19:2; 24:32; 43:24.

because they had heard
“because they had been told/informed” or “because someone had told them”

that they would eat bread there.
“that they were going to eat a meal {with him} there {at his house}.” For some languages it is more natural to put the last half of this verse at the beginning of the verse and say, “When Joseph’s brothers heard that they were going to eat the noon meal with Joseph {at his house}, they got their gifts ready to give him when he came/got home.” Do what is best in your language.

Gen 43:26 Then Joseph came to the house, and they brought to him the gift that {was} in their hands into the house, and they bowed down to him to the ground. 

Then Joseph came to the house, and 
“When Joseph came to his house,” or “When Joseph came/got home,”

they brought to him the gift that {was} in their hands into the house,
“his brothers {gave/presented} to him the gift/gifts that they had brought with them into the house.”

and they bowed down to him to the ground.
“Then they bowed {themselves} down before him {with their faces} to the ground {to show him respect/honor}.” or “Then they prostrated themselves on the ground {to respect/honor him}.” See how you translated “bowed down...ground” in Gen 42:6. (See: translate-symaction)


Gen 43:27 Then he asked them about {their} wellbeing, and he said, “{Are things} well {for} your aged father whom you spoke about? Is he still alive?”

Then he asked them about {their} wellbeing, 
“Then Joseph asked them how they were doing,” or “Then he/Joseph greeted them”

“{Are things} well {for} your aged father 
“Is your aged/elderly father {doing} well” or “Is your aged/elderly father in good health,”

“whom you spoke about {to me} {before}?” or “whom you mentioned {to me}?”

Is he still alive?”
“Is he still living?”


Gen 43:28 And they said, “{Things are} well for your servant our father. He {is} still alive.” Then they bowed and bowed down. 

And they said,
“They answered {him},”

“{Things are} well for your servant our father. He {is} still alive.”
“{Yes sir,} our father, who highly respects you, is still alive and well/blessed.” The brothers refer to their father as “your servant” here to show respect to Joseph and to acknowledge his high position. Translate this phrase in a polite way that shows respect toward Joseph. Also, the pronoun “our” is exclusive here because Joseph’s brothers did not yet know that they were talking to Joseph. (See: translate-honorifics)

Then they bowed 
“Then they bowed {their heads}” or “Then they knelt”. In this verse, the terms “bowed” and “bowed down” translate two different Hebrew words that together describe and emphasize the process of bowing down to the ground.

Then he lifted his eyes and
“Then Joseph looked up/around and” or “When Joseph looked around {at them all}, he”. Consider again how you translated the idiom “lifted...eyes” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 13:10, 14; 18:2; 22:4, 13; 24:63-64; 31:10; 33:1, 5; 37:25; 39:7; 43:29. (See: figs-idiom)

“Is this your youngest brother 
“So this {young man} must be your youngest brother” or “I suppose this {young man} is your youngest brother”. This question could be an actual question or a rhetorical question. The fact that Joseph does not wait for an answer suggests that this is a rhetorical question, especially since he already realized that the new brother in the group was Benjamin (verse 16). (See: figs-rquestion)

whom you spoke to me {about}?”
“whom you told me about.” Make sure that your punctuation here fits with the way you translated this sentence, either as a question or a statement.
   
Then he said,
“Then he said {to Benjamin},”

“May God be gracious to you, 
“I pray that God will be gracious/kind to you,” See how you translated “God has been gracious to...” in Gen 33:11. Also see how you translated “grace” in 24:12, 14 ,27, 49; 39:21.

“young man.” The phrase “my son” is a kind way to address a man who is younger or of lower status; it does not mean that Benjamin was Joseph’s actual son. Also, for some languages it is necessary to put this address first in this quote. Do what is natural in your language.


Gen 43:30 Then Joseph hurried out, because his emotions boiled over for his brother, and he sought to cry, and he went to the inner room and cried there.

Then Joseph hurried out, 
“Then Joseph quickly/hurriedly left {the room} or “Then/Suddenly Joseph rushed out {of the room}”

because his emotions boiled over for his brother,
“because he was feeling deeply emotional about his brother,” or “because he felt overwhelmed with emotions for/about his brother”

and he sought to cry, 
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean (1) “and desired/wanted to cry,” or “and felt like crying,” or “and was about to cry,” (2) “and was looking for {a place} to cry” or “and went to find {a place} to cry,” 

and he went to the inner room 
“so he went to his private room” or “So he went to his bedroom,”

Then he served to them servings {of food} from before him,
“Then Joseph served his brothers food from his table,” or “Then Joseph {had his servants} serve food to his brothers from his table,” As a person of high position and status, Joseph probably had his servants serve the food rather doing it himself. Decide whether you want to make that information explicit in your translation or include it in a footnote. (See: figs-explicit)

but Benjamin’s serving was five times larger 
“but the amount of food that was served to Benjamin was five times more” or “but he {had them} serve Benjamin five times more {food}”

“Then they {ate food,} drank {wine} and celebrated/feasted with him.” or “Then his brothers feasted and drank {wine} freely with him.” or “Then they feasted and drank {wine} freely with him {until they were very merry}.” The Hebrew verb for “became drunk” is the same word that is used in Gen 9:21 to describe Noah when he had drunk so much wine that he had fallen asleep. Here, it probably means that they had drunk enough wine that they were feeling happy and sociable.

saying, “Fill the men’s sacks {with} food, as much as
“Fill the men’s {grain} sacks/bags with as much grain as”. These grain sacks were carried by the brother’s donkeys and were probably fairly large since donkeys are able to carry around 50 kilos (about 110 pounds).

Gen 44:12 Then he searched, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest, and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack! 

Then he searched, 
“Then the/Joseph’s servant searched {their sacks/bags}.” Consider what is the best way to refer to Joseph’s servant in verses 6, 10 and 12. Also see how you translated “searched” in Gen 31:35. (See: writing-pronouns)

beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest, 
“beginning/starting with the oldest {brother} and ending/finishing with the youngest {brother/one},” or “He started with the oldest {brother} and continued until he came to the youngest {brother/one},” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

Gen 44:14 Then Judah and his brothers came to Joseph’s house, and he was still there, so they fell to the ground before him. 

Then Judah and his brothers came to Joseph’s house, and 
“When Judah and his brothers arrived at Joseph’s house,”

he was still there, 
“Joseph was still there,” or “Joseph was there {waiting for them},”

so they fell to the ground before him.

Gen 44:15 Then Joseph said to them, “What {is} this deed that you have done? Did you not know that a man who {is} like me indeed divines?” 

Then Joseph said to them, 
“Then Joseph told/asked them,” or “Then Joseph exclaimed to them,” Make sure the way you translate this quote margin fits with the way you translate the following rhetorical question. (See: writing-quotations)

“What {is} this deed that you have done? 
“Why did you do such a terrible thing?” or “What you have done is terrible!” or “You should never have done such a thing!” Joseph uses this rhetorical question to express anger and scold his brothers. Some languages must use a strong statement or exclamation here instead. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-rquestion)

Did you not know 
“You should have known” 

that a man who {is} like me
“that a ruler like me” or “that someone in my position”

indeed divines?”
“regularly practices divination!” or “knows how to discover the secret things {that people do}!” or “could use divination to find out {what you did}!” See how you translated “divines” in verse 5.


Gen 44:16 And Judah said, “What can we say to my lord? What can we speak? And how can we justify ourselves? God has found out the sin of your servants. Behold us, slaves for my lord, both we and {the one} in whose hand the cup was found.” 

And Judah said, 
“Judah answered,” or “Judah replied {to him},” (See: writing-quotations)

“What can we say to my lord? 
“Sir, there is nothing {convincing} that we can say {to you}.” Judah uses a series of rhetorical questions in this verse to express how upset he is about what has happened and to emphasize that there is nothing that they can say to convince Joseph that they are innocent. Consider what is the best way to communicate those things in your language. (See: figs-rquestion)

What can we speak? 
“There is no way that we can explain {this}!” or “We cannot explain {this}!” (See: figs-rquestion)

And how can we justify ourselves?
“We do not know how to show/prove {to you} that we did not do this!” or “There is no way we can prove/show {to you} that we are innocent!” (See: figs-rquestion)

God has found out the sin of your servants.
“God has uncovered/exposed our guilt {for our past sin}.” or “God is punishing {us} your {humble} servants for our {past} sin/sins.” or “God is using this occasion to punish us for our {past} sin.” Judah refers to himself and his brothers as “your servants” to show humility and to honor Joseph. Also, Judah is probably referring here to the sin of selling their brother Joseph into slavery years ago. You could include that information in a footnote. (See: figs-123person)

Behold us, slaves for my lord, 
“Here we {all} are here, {ready to be} slaves for you, sir,” or “{So now,} sir, we are {all} here to be your slaves,” (See: translate-honorifics) 

both we and {the one} 
“including {the one/man}”

“Far be it from me to do that!
“{No,} I would never {even} consider doing such a thing!” See how you translated “Far be it from...” in verse 7. (See: figs-idiom)

The man in whose hand the cup was found, he 
“{Only} the one who was found with my cup {in his sack/bag}” or “{Only} the man in whose sack/bag {my servant} found the/my cup” or “{Rather} {only} the one/man whom {my servant} found with my cup {in his sack/bag}”. See how you translated “in whose hand the cup was found” in verse 16. (See: figs-activepassive)

will be a slave for me. 
“will be/become my slave.” or “will {stay and} serve me as a slave.”

But you, go up in peace to your father.”
“But you {others} may return to your father in peace.” or “As for {the rest of} you, you may go {back} home to your father without any trouble.” or “{The rest of} you are free to go {back} home to your father.” The phrase “go up” refers to the fact that the land of Canaan was higher in elevation than the country of Egypt. Some translations leave “up” implied. Do what is best in your language.


44:18-34 Judah Pleads For Benjamin’s Freedom

Gen 44:18 Then Judah went near to him and said, “Please, my lord, please let your servant speak a word in my lord’s ears, and do not let your anger burn against your servant, since you {are} like Pharaoh. 

Then Judah went near to him and said, 
“Then Judah went/came up/closer to Joseph and said,” or “Then Judah approached Joseph and said {to him},” See how you translated “went near” in Gen 43:19.

“Please, my lord,
“Please, sir/master,” or “Excuse me, sir/master,” Compare how you translated this phrase in Gen 43:20. (See: figs-honorifics)

please let your servant 
“I humbly ask you to let me” or “will you please allow {me} your {humble} servant to”. Make sure your translation of “your servant” refers here to Judah, not to someone else. Throughout verses 18-34, Judah uses phrases such as “my lord”, “your servant” and “your servants” to be polite and show respect to Joseph. At each point in these verses, make sure it is clear in your translation whom he is referring to. (See: translate-honorifics)

speak a word in my lord’s ears, 
“say something to you.” or “speak freely/plainly to you.” (See: figs-synecdoche)

and do not let your anger burn against your servant, 
“Please do not be angry with/at me,” Compare how you translated the idiom “his anger burned” in Gen 39:19. (See: figs-idiom)

Gen 44:19 My lord asked his servants, saying, ‘Do you have a father or {another} brother?’ 

My lord asked 
“Sir, {previously} you asked” or “Sir, {the last/previous time we were here,} you asked” 

his servants,
“{us} your {humble} servants” or “us”. Make sure it is clear in your translation of “his servants” that Judah is referring to himself and his brothers. (See: figs-123person)

saying, ‘Do you have a father or {another} brother?’
“Is your father still alive? Do you have {another} brother?” or “if/whether our father was {still} alive and if/whether we had {any other} brothers.” Consider whether it is better in your language to translate the embedded quotes in verses 19-23 as direct or indirect quotes. (See: figs-quotesinquotes)


Gen 44:20 And we said to my lord, ‘We have an aged father and the youngest son of {his} old age. But his brother is dead, so he is left by himself from his mother, and his father loves him.’

And we said to my lord, 
“And we told you, sir, that” or “We answered you, sir, that” (See: writing-quotations)

‘We have an aged father and the youngest son 
“our aged/elderly father is {still} alive and {with him is} his youngest son” or “we have an elderly father and also a younger brother” (See: figs-quotesinquotes)

of {his} old age.
“who was born when our father was {already} old.” or “whom our father had when he was {already} old.”

But his brother is dead, so he is left by himself from his mother, 
“That son is the only one left {alive} from his mother, since his brother died.” or “And since that son’s brother is dead, he is his mother’s only living son/child.” In this sentence, “brother” refers to an older brother from the same father and mother. Some languages have a special kinship term for that. Do what is best in your language. (See: translate-kinship)

and his father loves him.’
“So his/our father loves him {very much}.” or “So his/our father {especially} loves our youngest brother.”

Gen 44:21 “Then you said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me, and I will set my eyes on him.’ 

“Then you said to your servants, 
“Then you told {us, who are} your {humble} servants” or “Then you told us, sir,” Judah uses the humble term “your servants” to show respect and honor to someone of higher status and authority. (See: translate-honorifics)

‘Bring him down to me, and I will set my eyes on him.’ 
“Bring your youngest brother to me so that I can see/meet him.” or “to bring our youngest brother {here} to you so that you could/can see him for yourself.” The verb “bring...down” refers to the fact that Egypt is lower in elevation than the region of Canaan was. Some translations leave “down” implied. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-quotesinquotes)


Gen 44:22 And we said to my lord, ‘The young man is not able to leave his father, because {if} he leaves his father, then he will die.’

because {if} he leaves his father, then he will die.’ 
“because if he did/does, his father would/will die {from anxiety}.” Make sure the way you translate this clause fits with how you translated the previous clause as either a direct or indirect quote. (See: figs-quotesinquotes)


Gen 44:23 But you said to your servants, ‘If your youngest brother does not come down with you, you will not see my face again.’

But you said to your servants, 
“But then, sir, you told us that” or “But you told us that” 

‘If your youngest brother does not come down with you, 
“if our youngest brother did not come back here with us,” or “unless our youngest brother came with us”. Consider again whether to translate the embedded quotes in verses 19-23 as direct or indirect quotes. (See: figs-quotesinquotes)

you will not see my face again.’
“you would not permit/allow us to see you again.” or “we could never see you again.” Make sure that all the parts of this sentence fit together well in your translation. (See: figs-quotesinquotes)

Then our father said, 
“{Months} later our father told {us},” The pronouns “our” and “{us}” are exclusive here because they do not include Joseph. (See: figs-exclusive)

‘Return, buy a little food for us.’
“Go back {to Egypt} {and} buy some {more} grain for {all of} us.” The pronoun “us” is inclusive here because what Judah’s father (Jacob) had said included the brothers whom he was talking to. See how you translated this same quote in Gen 43:2. (See: figs-exclusive)


Gen 44:26 But we said, ‘We cannot go down. If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go. For we are not able to see the man’s face and our youngest brother not {be} with us.’

For we are not able to see the man’s face 
“We will not be allowed/permitted to go before/to the man/governor {who sells grain there}” or “The man/governor {who sells grain there} will not allow/permit us to see him {again}”. The phrase “the man’s face” refers to the governor (Joseph) himself. Translate this in a way that is natural in your language. (See: figs-synecdoche)

45:1-28 Joseph Reveals His Identity To His Brothers

Gen 45:1 Then Joseph was not able to control himself before all who were standing by him, and he called out, “Have every man leave from before me!” So no man stood with him when Joseph revealed himself to his brothers. 

Then Joseph
“When Joseph {heard that, he}” or “When Joseph {heard what Judah said, he}”

was not able to
“was no {longer} able to” or “could no {longer}”

control himself
“control/hide his emotions/feelings” or “keep himself from crying”

before all who were standing by him, 
“in front of all his servants who were with/attending him,” or “in front of all his attendants/servants,” Make sure that your translation of this phrase refers to Joseph’s servants, not his brothers.

and he called out, 
“and/so he shouted {to them},” or “and/so he said loudly {to them},”

“Have every man leave 
“All of you, leave” 

from beside me!”
“my presence!” or “the room!”

So no man stood with him when Joseph revealed himself to his brothers. 
“So Joseph was alone with his brothers when he made himself known to them.” or “{Immediately the/his servants/attendants left the room,} so that no one else was with him when he told his brothers who he was.” Make sure your use of nouns or pronouns to refer to Joseph and his brothers here is clear and natural in your language. (See: writing-pronouns)


Gen 45:2 And he gave his voice in crying, and the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard. 

And he gave his voice in crying, and
“Then he raised his voice and cried loudly/uncontrollably, so that” or “But he started crying so loudly that”. Consider whether your language has an idiom such as “gave his voice in crying”. Also see how you translated “cried” in Gen 42:24; 43:30. (See: figs-idiom)

the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard.
“{many} Egyptians heard {him/it}, including {the members of} Pharaoh’s household/family.” or “the Egyptian {servants} heard {him/it}, and so did Pharaoh’s household/family.” The word “house” refers here to Pharaoh’s family members and servants, not a literal building. (See: figs-metonymy)


Gen 45:3 Then Joseph said to his brothers, “I {am} Joseph! Is my father still alive?” But his brothers were not able to answer him, because they were terrified at his presence.

Then Joseph said to his brothers, 
“Then Joseph/he exclaimed to his brothers {in their language},” In this chapter, “brothers” refers to Joseph’s older brothers (from different mothers) and his younger brother (from the same mother). (See: translate-kinship)

“I {am} Joseph! 
“I {am} {your brother} Joseph!” or “I {am} Joseph, {your brother}!”

Is my father still alive?”
“Is our father still alive?” Joseph uses “my father” to emphasize his relationship with his father. Make sure your translation does not sound like he had a different father than his brothers.

But his brothers were not able to answer him, 
“But his/Joseph’s brothers could not reply/respond to him,” or “His brothers could not say a word,”

because they were terrified at his presence.
“because they were terrified/shocked {to realize} that they were in his presence.” or “because they felt very afraid to be standing in front of him.” For some languages it is necessary to put this clause earlier in this sentence and say, “But his brothers were so terrified to see him that they could not answer him.” Do what is best in your language.

“After/When they went closer {to him}, he said {to them},” or “After they did that, he said {to them},”

“I {am} Joseph your brother,
“I {really/truly am} your brother Joseph,”

whom you sold into Egypt.
“whom you sold {to be a slave} in {the country of} Egypt.” or “whom you sold {as a slave that was brought/taken here} to Egypt.” Joseph’s brothers sold him to slave traders who were going to Egypt. If necessary, you could make some of that information explicit in your translation. (See: figs-explicit)


Gen 45:5 And now, do not be grieved and do not let it burn in your eyes that you sold me here, because God sent me ahead of you for the preservation of life. 

And now, 
“But now,” or “But”

do not be grieved 
“do not be upset/distressed”

and do not let it burn in your eyes 
“or/and angry with/at yourselves”. Consider again how you translated various idioms for “anger” or “be angry” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 4:5-6; 30:2; 31:35-36; 34:7; 44:18; 45:5. It may be necessary to translate these idioms in different ways, depending on the context. (See: figs-idiom)

that you sold me here, 
“that you sold me {and caused me to be a slave} here,” or “for selling me {as a slave},” 

because God sent me 
“because God sent me {here}” or “because {it was actually} God {who} sent me {here}”

Gen 45:6 For this {is} two years the famine {has been} in the midst of the land, and {there are} still five years {in} which {there will} not be plowing and harvesting. 

For this {is} two years 
“For two years {now}” or “The past two years”

the famine {has been} in the midst of the land,
“{there has been} a famine throughout this country/region,” or “a famine {has been affecting/devastating} this whole region,” See how you translated “famine” in Gen 12:10.

and {there are} still five years {in} which 
“and for another five years {it will be so severe/bad that}” or “and during the next five years {it will be even worse, so that}” or “and there will be five more years when”

{there will} not be plowing and harvesting. 
“{there will} be no plowing {of fields} or harvesting {of crops}.” or “no one will {be able to} plant {seeds} or harvest {crops}.”


Gen 45:7 But God sent me ahead of you to preserve a remnant for you on the earth, and to keep you alive by a great deliverance.

But God sent me 
“That is why God sent me {here}” or “God sent me {here}” or “God caused me to come {here}”

ahead of you 
“before you came,” or “before you got here,”

to preserve a remnant for you 
“so that you will have descendants survive/living” or “to help you survive and have descendants” 

on the earth,
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) “on the earth” (2) “in the/this land”

and to keep you alive 
“by helping you stay live” or “by saving your lives”

by a great deliverance. 
“through this/his amazing/extraordinary rescue.” or “in this amazing/powerful way.” For some languages it is better to put the last two phrases earlier in this sentence and say, “But God sent me ahead of you to save your lives in this amazing way so that you will survive and have descendants on the earth.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 45:8 So now, {it was} not you {who} sent me here, but God. And he has made me father to Pharaoh, and lord over all his house and the ruler in all the land of Egypt.

So now, 
“So then,” or “So”

{it was} not you 
“you are/were not {the ones}”

{who} sent me here,
“{who} caused me to come here,” 

but God. 
“rather {it was} God {who sent/brought me}.” or “rather, God {is/was the one} {who did it/that}.”

And he has made me father to Pharaoh, 
“He has {also/even} made me {like a} father to Pharaoh,” Joseph was like a father to Pharaoh in that Pharaoh highly honored him and Joseph took care of Pharaoh’s household and all their needs. (See: figs-metaphor)

and lord over 
“so that I am the master/supervisor of” or “so that I am the one in charge of”. See how you translated “lord” in Gen 42:30, 33.

“his entire household”. See how you translated “house” in Gen 41:40. (See: figs-metonymy)

and the ruler 
“and {also} the governor” or “and {also} the highest official”

Gen 45:9 ”Hurry and go up to my father and say to him, ‘This {is what} your son Joseph says, “God has made me lord over all Egypt. Come down to me, do not delay. 

“Hurry and go up 
“Hurry up/back” or “Leave quickly and go back” or “Return quickly”. In this verse, the words “up” and “down” reflect the fact that Canaan was higher in elevation than Egypt. Many languages leave those words implied. Do what is best in your language.

“and tell him that his son Joseph has sent him this message:” Consider whether it is best in your language to translate this embedded quote as a direct or indirect quote. (See: figs-quotesinquotes)

“God has made me lord over all Egypt. 
“God has made/appointed me ruler/governor over the entire {country of} Egypt.” Consider whether it is best in your language to translate this doubly embedded quote (which continues through verse 11) as a direct or indirect quote. An example of an indirect quote would be: “God has made him the ruler over all Egypt. He urges you to come down there to live near him, without delay. He also says that you and your family may live in Goshen Province and that way you will live near him....He will provide for you there...” (See: figs-quotesinquotes)

Come down to me, 
“{So} {please} come down {here} {to live} near me,”

“{and} do not delay/wait.” or “{and} do not take very long to come.” For some languages it is more natural to put this clause first in this sentence and say, “{So} {please} do not take very long, but rather come down/here quickly {to live} near me.” Do what is best in your language.

Gen 46:5 Then Jacob got up from Beersheba, and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father and their little ones and their wives in the carts that Pharaoh had sent to carry him. 

Then Jacob got up from Beersheba, 
“Then/So Jacob left {the city of} Beersheba,” or “After that, Jacob {whose other name was Israel} left {the city of} Beersheba,” Be consistent with how you spell “Beersheba” throughout the book of Genesis. See Gen 21:14, 31-33; 22:19; 26:23, 33; 28:10; 46:1, 5.

and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father 
“and his sons, the sons of Israel, took/transported {him} their father” or “and his sons, {that is} the sons of Israel, took/transported him” or “and his sons took/transported him”. “Israel” is the name that God gave to Jacob (Gen 32:28, 35:10). In chapters 45 and 46, the text repeatedly switches back and forth between both of Jacob’s names. Make sure it is clear in your translation that these two names refer to the same person. You could include a footnote that helps readers understand what is happening.

and their little ones and their wives 
“as well as their children and wives” or “and their wives and children”. See how you translated “little ones and...wives” in Gen 45:19. (See: figs-infostructure)

in the carts 
“in the wagons”. See how you translated “carts” in Gen 45:19, 21, 27. 

that Pharaoh 
“that {King} Pharaoh” or “that Pharaoh {the king of Egypt}” or “that the king {of/over Egypt}”. For a note about how “Pharaoh” is used like a name in the Bible, see Gen 12:15. (See: translate-names)

had sent
“had sent {to Canaan}” or “had provided”

to carry him.
“to transport him/them {to Egypt}.” or “for them to ride in/on {to Egypt}.” The pronoun “him” refers to Jacob, the head of his family. and includes Jacob’s wives and children. It may be necessary to use the plural pronoun “them” to make that clear. (See: figs-synecdoche)

 
Gen 46:6 And they took their livestock and their possessions that they had acquired in the land of Canaan. Then they came to Egypt, Jacob and all of his offspring with him. 

And they took their livestock 
“They {also} took/brought {with them} their livestock/animals”

and their possessions 
“and their {other} belongings”. Consider again how you translated “possessions” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 12:5 (and note); 13:6; 14:11-12, 16, 21; 15:14; 31:18; 36:7; 46:6. It may be necessary to translate this term in slightly different ways, depending on the context.

(See: translate-kinship)

So all his offspring he brought with him to Egypt.
“{Yes,} he/Jacob brought his entire family with him to Egypt.” or “He/Jacob had all his offspring/descendants with him when he arrived in Egypt.” For some languages, it may be clearer or more natural to change the order of the clauses in this verse and say, “He/Jacob brought his entire {extended} family with him to Egypt, {including} his sons...” Do what is best in your language.

Hanoch and Pallu and Hezron and Carmi.
“Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.” For some languages it is more natural to include “and” between every name in a list like this. For other languages it is more natural to use commas between names and leave “and” implied, except before the last name in the list. See how you translated similar lists of names in Genesis 10.

Gen 47:3 Then Pharaoh said to his brothers, “What {is} your work?” And they said to Pharaoh, “Your servants {are} herders of sheep, both we and our fathers.” 

Then Pharaoh said to his brothers, 
“Then Pharaoh asked Joseph’s brothers,” or “Then Pharaoh asked them,” Make sure that your translation of “his brothers” refers to Joseph’s brothers, not Pharaoh’s. (See: writing-pronouns)

“What {is} your work?” 
“What {is} your occupation?” or “What {kind of} work do you do?” or “What do you do for a living?”

And they said to Pharaoh, 
“They answered Pharaoh/him,” or “{One of} them said/replied,”

“Your servants 
“{We} your {humble} servants” or “Your Majesty/Highness, we” or “Sir, we”. See how you translated “your servants” in Gen 46:34. (See: figs-123person)

{are} herders of sheep,
“{are} shepherds/herdsmen,” or “raise sheep {for a living},”

both we and our fathers.” 
“just like/as our forefathers/ancestors were/did.” or “{which is} the same {kind of} work/occupation that our forefathers/ancestors did/had.”


Gen 47:4 Then they said to Pharaoh, “We have come to sojourn in the land, because there is not pasture for the flock{s} that {belong} to your servants, because the famine {is} heavy in the land of Canaan. So now, please let your servants settle in the land of Goshen.”

Then they said to Pharaoh, 
“They {also} said to him,” or “Then they added,” For some languages it is more natural here to omit this quote margin, because the same people (Joseph’s brothers) are still talking to the same person (Pharaoh). However, the words emphasize what Joseph’s five brothers say next and may indicate that there was a pause between what they said in verse 3 and verse 4. Do what is best in your language. (See: writing-quotations)

“We have come to sojourn 
“We have come {here} to live/stay for a while” or “We came {here} to live/stay temporarily”

in the land,
“in this country” or “in {your} land/country”

because there is not pasture for the flock{s} that {belong} to your servants, 
“because there was not enough pasture/grass for our flock{s} {of sheep and goats}” or “Our flocks, sir, did not have enough grass to eat”. Consider whether or not it is better to begin a new sentence here in your language. 

because the famine {is} heavy in the land of Canaan. 
“in the region of Canaan {where we are/come from}, because the famine {is} very/so severe/terrible {there}.” For some languages it may be clearer or more natural to put this clause earlier in this sentence. For example: “The famine is so severe/terrible in the region of Canaan {where we are/come from} that there is not enough grass {in the fields} for our flocks.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

So now, please let your servants settle 
“So now/then, please let {us} your {humble} servants settle/live” or “So then, sir, please let us settle/live”. See how you translated “your servants” in verse 3 to show respect. (See: figs-123person)

“in the region/territory of Goshen.” or ‘in Goshen Province.”

Gen 47:5 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, saying, “Your father and your brothers have come to you. 

Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, saying, 
“Then Pharaoh {turned} to Joseph and said,” or “{When he heard that,} Pharaoh said to Joseph,”

“Your father and your brothers have come to you.
“{Now that} your father and brothers have come {to live} near you,” Make sure your translation of this clause does not sound like Pharaoh was telling Joseph something he did not already know. Rather, he is stating shared knowledge as the basis for what he says next.
 

Gen 47:6 The land of Egypt {is} before you. Settle your father and your brothers in the best land; let them settle in the land of Goshen. And if you know that there are men of ability among them, then appoint them overseers of livestock over {those} that {belong} to me.”

The land of Egypt {is} before you. 
“the {entire} land of Egypt {is} available to you {to choose from}.” or “you may choose any part of the land of Egypt {for them to live in}.” Consider whether it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here or to continue the sentence from verse 5.

Settle your father and your brothers 
“{So} have your father and your brothers settle” or “{In fact,} they may settle/live” (See: writing-pronouns)

in the best land; let them settle in the land of Goshen.
“in the best/finest land {in the country}, in Goshen Province.” or “in the region/territory of Goshen, {which is} the best/finest land {in the country}.”

And if you know that there are men of ability among them,
“And if you know that some of them are especially/very talented/skilled {at/in raising livestock},”

“then make them herdsmen over my livestock {also}.” or “then put them in charge of raising my livestock {also}.”

Gen 47:7 Then Joseph brought Jacob his father and presented him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.

Then Joseph brought Jacob his father 
“Then Joseph brought/took his father Jacob” 

and presented him before Pharaoh,
“and presented/introduced him to Pharaoh,” or “before/to Pharaoh and presented/introduced him {to him},” or “to Pharaoh and introduced them to each other,” See how you translated “presented” in verse 2.

and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. 
“and Jacob {greeted and} blessed Pharaoh.” or “and Jacob {asked God to} bless/prosper Pharaoh.” or “and Jacob greeted Pharaoh with a blessing.” In Hebrew, there is a common greeting which means “peace be to you,” so it is possible that Jacob used this blessing of peace here to greet Pharaoh.


Gen 47:8 Then Pharaoh said to Jacob, “How many {are} the days of the years of your life?” 

Then Pharaoh said to Jacob, 
“Then Pharaoh asked Jacob,”

“How many {are} the days of the years of your life?”
“{Sir,} how old are you now?” Make sure your translation of Pharaoh’s question about Jacob’s age sounds polite. Also, for some languages, a title of respect (such as “Sir”) is necessary whenever someone addresses a distinguished old man such as Jacob. (See: figs-politeness)


Gen 47:9 And Jacob said to Pharaoh, “The days of the years of my sojournings {are} 130 years. The days of the years of my life have been few and difficult, and they have not reached the days of the years of my fathers’ lives in the days of their sojournings.” 

And Jacob said to Pharaoh, 
“Jacob answered him,” or “Jacob replied,” (See: writing-quotations)

“The days of the years of my sojournings {are} 130 years. 
“I have been living {in this world} for 130 years.” or “The length of my life {so far} has been 130 years.” Consider again how you translated “sojournings”, “sojourn” and “sojourner” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 12:10; 15:13; 17:8; 19:9; 20:1; 21:23, 34; 23:4; 26:3; 28:4; 32:4; 35:27; 37:1; 47:4, 9. It may be necessary to translate these terms in different ways, depending on the context. 

The days of the years of my life have been few and difficult,
“I have not lived very long, and I have faced/had many difficulties/hardships.” or “My life has been short, with many difficulties/hardships.”

and they have not reached the days of the years of my fathers’ lives 
“In fact, I have lived less years than my forefathers/ancestors did” or “In fact, I have not lived {nearly} as long as my forefathers/ancestors did”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

“during the days/years/time that they lived {on earth}.” or “during their years/time {on earth}.”


Gen 47:10 Then Jacob blessed Pharaoh and left from the presence of Pharaoh.

Then Jacob blessed Pharaoh 
“Then Jacob {again} {asked God to} bless Pharaoh” or “Then Jacob {said goodbye} to Pharaoh with a blessing”. It was customary in Hebrew to use the blessing “peace be to you” both when greeting and when leaving someone. See how you translated “blessed” in verse 7.

and left from the presence of Pharaoh.
“and left his presence.” or “and left him.” or “and left Pharaoh’s {throne} room.”

Gen 47:11 Then Joseph settled his father and his brothers, and he gave them property in the land of Egypt, in the best land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. 

Then 
“So” or “After that,”

Joseph settled his father and his brothers, and he gave them property in the land of Egypt, in the best land, in the land of Rameses,
“Joseph gave his father and his brothers the best/choicest property/land in the country of Egypt, and they {and their families} settled there. {The property was} in Rameses Province/Count, {that is, Goshen Province/County},” or “Joseph helped his father and brothers settle in the country of Egypt. He gave them the choicest property {in Egypt}, which was in {Goshen Province, also known as} Rameses Province.” It is implied that Rameses (verse 11) was another name for Goshen (verses 1, 4, 6). If necessary, you could make that information explicit in your translation or put it in a footnote. Later in Egypt’s history, some of the Pharaohs were named Rameses and a city was named after one of them (Exodus 1:11). (See: figs-explicit)

as Pharaoh had commanded.
“just as Pharaoh had commanded/told him {to do}.” or “{He/Joseph did} {exactly} as Pharaoh had commanded/told him {to do}.” It may be more natural to put this clause first in this verse and say, “After that, Joseph did what Pharaoh had commanded/told him {to do}: He helped his father and brothers settle in the country of Egypt. He gave them property in Rameses Province/County, {that is, Goshen Province/County,} {which was} the choicest land {in Egypt}.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

bread, according to the mouth{s} of the little ones.
“food, based on how many children/people were in each family.” or “as much food as {each family} needed to feed {all} the children/people in their family.“ The children are mentioned to emphasize that all the members of the families were well-provided for, including the youngest ones. Make sure it is clear in your translation that Joseph was providing food for everyone in each family, not just the children. (See: figs-synecdoche)


47:13-26 How Joseph Ruled Egypt During The Rest Of The Famine

Gen 47:13 Now there was no bread in all the earth, because the famine {was} very heavy, and the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan were languishing because of the famine.

Now 
“Now {meanwhile,}” or “{Meanwhile,}” or “{After a while,}” Consider the best way in your language to begin this new section that returns to the famine and how it was progressing.

there was no bread 
“there was no {more} food” or “there was {almost} no food” or “there was very little food {available}”. This clause is probably an exaggeration to emphasize that there was so little food that the people were starving. Consider the best way to communicate that in your language. (See: figs-hyperbole)

in all the earth,
This phrase is ambiguous in the Hebrew text. It could mean (1) “in all the earth,” or “in the entire {known} world,” or “anywhere,” which might be an exaggeration (like the previous phrase); (2) “in all the land,” or “in the/that entire area/region {of the earth/world},” which includes Egypt and Canaan (mentioned later in the verse) and other nearby regions and countries. See how you translated “all the earth” in Gen 41:57.

because the famine {was} very heavy, 
“because the famine {was} very/so severe/oppressive/terrible.” For some languages it may be clearer or more natural to put this clause first in this sentence and say, for example: “Now {after a while,} the famine was/became so severe/terrible in the entire world that there was very little food {available} {anywhere}.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

and the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan 
“As a result, {the people of/in} the country of Egypt and the region of Canaan” or “In fact, {the people living in} the lands of Egypt and Canaan”. Make sure your translation of this phrase refers to the people who live in Egypt and Canaan, not just the lands. (See: figs-metonymy)

were languishing 
“were fainting/weak” or “were suffering badly/terribly” or “were wasting away”. The verb “languishing” refers in general to the suffering that the famine was causing, including things such as weakness, fainting and other distress. Some languages have an idiom (like “were wasting away”) that fits well here. Do what is best in your language. 

because of the famine.
“because of the severe lack of food.” or “because they did not have enough to eat.” or “from hunger.”


Gen 47:14 And Joseph collected all the silver that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan for the grain which they were buying, and Joseph brought the silver to the house of Pharaoh. 

And Joseph collected all the silver that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan for the grain which they were buying,
“So the people spent their money buying grain from Joseph until he had collected/received all their money.” or “So they bought grain from Joseph until there was no more silver/money left in the country of Egypt or the land/region of Canaan.” 

and Joseph brought the silver to the house of Pharaoh. 
“Then Joseph/He {had his servants} take the silver/money to Pharaoh’s palace.” or “Joseph/He stored that silver/money in Pharaoh’s palace.” Joseph probably had servants do this for him. See what you did for a similar case in Gen 41:48. (See: figs-metonymy)


Gen 47:15 So the silver was consumed from the land of Egypt and from the land of Canaan, and all Egypt came to Joseph, saying, “Give us bread! And why should we die before you? For the silver is gone!” 

So the silver was consumed from the land of Egypt and from the land of Canaan, and
“So {when} {all} the silver/money in the land/country of Egypt and the land/region of Canaan had been used up,” or “When/After {the people in} Egypt and Canaan had spent all their silver/money,” Consider whether it is better in your language to use a passive or active clause here. (See: figs-activepassive)

all Egypt
“all {the people} in Egypt” or “the Egyptians all” or “{people from} all over Egypt”. The word “all” is an exaggeration (hyperbole) which emphasizes that a large number of Egyptians went to Joseph. Consider whether or not it is best to use hyperbole here in your language. (See: figs-hyperbole)

came to Joseph, 
“went to Joseph”. Consider whether “came” or “went” is more natural here in your language. (See: figs-go)

saying,
“and pleaded {with him},” or “and begged {him},” (See: writing-quotations)

“Give us bread! 
“{Sir,} {please} give us food”. Make sure your translation of the people’s request sounds polite, not rude or disrespectful. Also see how you translated “bread” in verses 12-13. (See: figs-synecdoche)

And why should we die before you? 
“so that we do not die {right here} in front of you!” or “and do not watch/let us starve to death!” or “so that we do not starve to death!“ The people use a rhetorical question here to emphasize how desperate they feel. Consider the best way to communicate that in your language. (See: figs-rquestion)

For the silver is gone!”
“There is no more money {to buy food/grain}!” or “We have no more money {to buy food/grain}!” It may be more natural to put this clause first in this quote and say, “{Sir,} we have no more money {to buy grain/food}! Please give us food so that we do not starve to death!“ Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 47:16 And Joseph said, “Bring your livestock and I will give {grain} to you {in exchange} for your livestock, since the silver is gone.” 

And Joseph said, 
“Joseph said/responded {to them},” or “Joseph replied,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Bring your livestock 
“Bring/Give {me} your livestock/animals”. The word “livestock” is general here and includes all the different kinds of animals that are specified in verse 17.

and I will give {grain} to you {in exchange} for your livestock, 
“and I will give/sell you {grain/food} if/when you give me your livestock/animals {to pay for it},” or ”and in exchange for them I will give you {grain/food},”

“since {all} your money is gone.” or “since you have spent {all} your silver/money.” For some languages it may be more natural to put this clause first in this quote and say, “Since your silver/money is gone, bring/give {me} your livestock to pay for the grain/food that I will give you.” Do what is best in your language.

Gen 47:17 So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave bread to them {in exchange} for the horses and for the herd{s} of sheep and for the herd{s} of cattle and for the donkeys. So he provided them with bread in that year {in exchange} for all their livestock.

So they brought their livestock to Joseph,
“So the people brought/took their livestock/animals to Joseph.”

and Joseph gave bread to them {in exchange} for the horses, and for the herd{s} of sheep, and for the herd{s} of cattle and for the donkeys.

Gen 47:18 And {when} that year had ended, then they came to him in the second year and said to him, “We cannot hide {it} from my lord that since the silver is consumed and the herd{s} of livestock {belong} to my lord, there is nothing left before my lord except our bodies and our lands. 

And {when} that year had ended, 
“When/After that year was over,”

“and told him,” or “and pleaded with him,” (See: writing-quotations)

“We cannot hide {it} from my lord that since
“Our lord/master, we cannot hide from you {the fact} that” or “Sir, as you know,”
For some languages, it may be more natural to put the address “my/our lord” or “sir” first in this quote. Also notice that this address is used three times in this verse to show extra respect to Joseph. Consider the best way to do that in your language. (See: figs-honorifics)

the silver is consumed and the herd{s} of livestock
“{our} silver/money is gone and our livestock/animals” or “not only is {our} silver/money {all} gone, but {all} {our} livestock/animals {also}”. Consider again how you translated “silver” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 13:2; 20:16 (and note) ; 23:15,16; 24:35, 53; 31:15; 37:28; 42:25, 27-28, 35; 43:12, 15, 18, 21-23; 44:1, 2, 8 ; 45:22; 47:14, 15, 16, 18. It may be necessary to translate this word in different ways, depending on the context.

{belong} to my lord,
“{belong} to {you,} our lord/master.” or “are yours, sir.” or “{belong} to you.” In this verse, the people use the third person (“my/our lord”) to address Joseph in a respectful manner. Consider the best way to do that in your language. (See: figs-123person)

there is nothing left before my lord except our bodies and our lands. 
“We have nothing left to pay/give you, sir, {for grain/food}, except ourselves and our land/fields.” or “The only way we can pay you {for grain/food} is to give you our land/farmland and work for you, sir.” Consider the best way to translate the Hebrew word for “land” here (and In verses 19-26), which refers to cultivated land (such as farmland or fields), not to the planet earth or to a country. It is different from the word for “land” in the rest of this chapter (in verses 1, 4, 6, 11, 13-15, 27-28).
 

Gen 47:19 Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land {in exchange} for the bread, and we and our land will be slaves to Pharaoh. Give {us} seed so that we will live and not die, and the land will not be desolate!”

Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? 
“What good would it do for us to die and our farmland/fields {to become ruined/empty}?” or “Please do not {just} watch us die or let our land/fields {become wasteland/desolate/empty}.” For many languages, the verb “die” does not fit with both people and land, so a different verb must be used for each one. The end of verse 19 specifies how the land would “die”. See how you translated a similar rhetorical question in verse 15. (See: figs-rquestion)

Buy us and our land {in exchange} for the bread, 
“{Instead,} {please} take us and our farmland/fields {in exchange} for food.” or “{Instead} {please} give us food and we will give you our farmland/fields and ourselves {to pay} for it.” Consider again how you translated the synecdoche “bread” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 3:19 (and note); 14:18; 21:14; 28:20; 37:25; 38:6; 41:54-55; 43:31; 47:12, 15, 17, 19. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context. (See: figs-synecdoche)

and we and our land will be slaves to Pharaoh. 
“Then we will be {King} Pharaoh’s slaves/servants, and our land/fields {will also be his}.” or “Then our land/fields will belong to {King} Pharaoh and we will work for him as his slaves/servants.” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

Give {us} seed 
“{Please} give {us} seeds {to sow/plant}” (See: figs-explicit)

so that we will live 
“so that we will/can survive” or “so that we will/can stay alive”

and not die,
“and not die {from hunger},” or “and not {starve} to death,” See how you translated “so that we will live and not die” in Gen 42:2.

and the land will not be desolate!”
“and {so that} the land will not become a desert!” or “and {so that} the land will produce/grow plants/crops {again}!” For some languages it may be clearer and more natural to put this clause earlier in this sentence and say, “{Please} {just} give {us} seeds {to plant} so that the land will produce/grow {food} crops {again} and then we will survive and not die {from hunger}!” Do what is best in your language.

“was {so/very} severe/oppressive.” or “was so severe/terrible that they did not have enough to eat.” See how you translated “heavy” in verses 4 and 13. For some languages, it may be clearer or more natural to change the order of clauses in this verse and say, “The famine was {very} severe for all the Egyptian people, so Joseph {agreed with their request/suggestion and} let them sell their fields {to him} {in exchange for grain/food}. In that way, Joseph/he bought/acquired all the land/farmland in {the country of} Egypt for {King} Pharaoh, so that {all} the land became Pharaoh’s {property}.” Do what is best in your language.

Gen 47:21 And {as for} the people, he moved them to the cities from {one} end of the border of Egypt to its {other} end. 

And {as for} the people, he moved them to the cities 
“Joseph {also} moved {all} the people {from their farmlands} to the {nearby} cities”. The Masoretic Hebrew text has “moved them to the cities” here, which Joseph may have done in order to make the grain more readily accessible to them. The Samaritan Pentateuch (a different Hebrew version) and the Septuagint (Greek translation of the Hebrew text) have “made the people slaves” instead, which may refer to the fact that all the people would now be working for Pharaoh since all the fields belonged to him. The textual variant that is not used in your translation could be put in a footnote. (See: translate-textvariants)

“The only land/farmland that he/Joseph did not buy was the priests’ {land},” or “The priests’ land/farmland was the only land he/Joseph did not buy,”

and for your little ones to eat.” 
“including your children.”


Gen 47:25 And they said, “You have kept us alive! Let us find favor in the eyes of my lord, and we will be slaves for Pharaoh.” 

And they said, 
“Then they responded,” or “The people said/replied {to him},” (See: writing-quotations)

“You have kept us alive! 
“You have saved our lives!” or “You have made it so we can live!”

Let us find favor in the eyes of my lord, 
“May we {continue to} find favor in your eyes/sight, master/sir,” or “Please {continue to} be kind to us, master/sir,”

and we will be slaves for Pharaoh.” 
“and we will {agree to} be/become {King} Pharaoh’s slaves/servants.” or “and we will serve {King} Pharaoh as his slaves/servants.”
 

Gen 47:26 And Joseph established it as a law to this day concerning the {farm}land of Egypt, {that} the fifth {belongs} to Pharaoh. Only the land of the priests by itself did not become Pharaoh’s. 

And Joseph established it as a law 
“So Joseph established/made a law”

to this day 
“{that is} still {in effect/force} today/now”. This phrase refers to the time that Moses was writing the book of Genesis. You could put that information in a footnote. For some languages it may be clearer or more natural to put this phrase at the end of the sentence and say, “{That law} is still {in effect/force} today/now.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

concerning the {farm}land of Egypt, {that} the fifth {belongs} to Pharaoh. 
“concerning/about the farmland/fields in {the country of} Egypt: one-fifth {of the harvest/crops} {belongs} to Pharaoh.” or “{that required} {people to give} to Pharaoh one-fifth {of all the crops they harvested} from the farmland/fields in Egypt.” See how you translated “a fifth” in verse 24. 

Only the land of the priests by itself did not become Pharaoh’s.
“The priests’ land was the only land {in Egypt} that did not belong to Pharaoh.” or “The only land that Pharaoh did not own was the land that belonged to the priests.” See how you translated “only the land of the priests” in verse 22. Also, consider again how you translated “land/farmland” in verses 18-26.


47:27-31 Jacob’s Last Wishes

 Gen 47:27 And Israel settled in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen, and they acquired {possessions} in it. And they were fruitful and multiplied greatly.

And 
“So/Now” or “Meanwhile”. It was already mentioned in verse 11 that Israel (Jacob) had settled in the country of Egypt. Your translation of verse 27 should not imply that he settled there again. (See: grammar-connect-time-background)

Israel 
“{Jacob, whose other name was} Israel,” or “Israel {that is, Jacob,}” The name “Israel” and the name “Jacob” refer to the same person. To make that clear, you could make “Jacob” explicit here in your translation or in a footnote. (See: figs-explicit)

settled 
“had settled {with his family}” or “was living/dwelling {with his family}”

in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen,
“in the region/territory of Goshen in the land/country of Egypt,” or “in Goshen Province/County in the country of Egypt,” See how you translated “in the land of Goshen” in Gen 45:10.

and they acquired {possessions} 
“and they acquired/gained {many possessions}” or “and owned/possessed {much property/land}”. This phrase is general here and refers to acquiring land and other possessions. (See: figs-explicit)

in it.
“in that {region/territory}.” or “there.”

And they were fruitful 
“They were fruitful/prolific” or “They had many children”. See how you translated a similar phrase (“be fruitful and multiply”) in Gen 35:11. (See: figs-idiom)

and multiplied greatly. 
“and their numbers increased greatly.” or “and became very numerous/many.”
 

Gen 47:28 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years, and the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were 147 years, 

And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years, and
“{When/After} Jacob had lived in the country of Egypt {for} seventeen years,”

the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were 147 years,
“he reached the age of 147 years.” or “he was 147 years old.”


Gen 47:29 and the days of Israel drew near {for him} to die. So he called for his son, for Joseph, and said to him, “If, please, I have found favor in your eyes, please put your hand under my thigh, and deal with me {in} kindness and faithfulness. Please do not bury me in Egypt. 

and the days of Israel drew near {for him} to die. So
“{When} it was almost time for Israel/him to die,” or “Israel/He {knew that} it was almost time for him to die, so” 

he called for his son, for Joseph,
“he summoned his son Joseph” or “he asked for his son Joseph {to come to him}”

and said to him, 
“and urged him,” (See: writing-quotations)

“If, please, I have found favor in your eyes, 
“Please show your favor/kindness toward me {and}“ or “Please do this favor for me:” or “Please, if you {truly} love me,” (See: figs-idiom)

please put your hand under my thigh, 
“put your hand under my thigh/leg {to show you will do what I ask},” See how you translated this clause in Gen 24:2, and see the note about this custom there. (See: translate-symaction)

and deal with me {in} kindness and faithfulness. 
“and {promise me that} {after I die,} you will be kind and faithful to me.” Consider again how you translated “kindness” in Gen 19:19; 20:13; 21:23; 24:12, 14, 27, 49; 32:10; 39:21; 40:14; 47:29, and how you translated “faithfulness” in Gen 24:27, 48, 49; 32:10; 42:16; 47:29.

Please do not bury me 
“Please {promise that you will} not bury my body/bones”. Make sure your translation of “bury me” does not sound like Israel would still be alive when he was buried. 

in Egypt.
“{here} in {the land/country of} Egypt.”


Gen 47:30 And {when} I lie down with my fathers, then carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their tomb.” And he said, “I will do according to your word.” 

And {when} I lie down with my fathers, 
“{When/After} I die and rest/sleep with my ancestors,” or “Rather, after I die and join my ancestors {who have died/gone before me},” The phrase “lie down with my fathers” is a idiom that refers to Jacob's death. See how you translated an idiom with a similar meaning in Gen 15:15. (See: figs-euphemism)

then carry me out of Egypt 
“carry/take my body out of Egypt {to the region of Canaan}”. See how you translated “me” in verse 29.

and bury me in their tomb.”
“and bury me/it in the same burial place where their bodies are.” Jacob is referring here to the cave near the city of Hebron that Abraham had bought as a family burial place, to bury Sarah there. Abraham, Isaac and Rebekah were also buried there (Gen 23:19-20; 25:9-10; 49:31). You could put some of that information in a footnote. Also see how you translated “grave” in Gen 35:20 and a different word with a similar meaning (“burial place”) in Gen 23:4, 6, 9, 20. 

And he 
“Then Joseph” or “Joseph”. Make sure it is clear in your translation that Joseph is the one speaking here. It may be helpful to read this paragraph aloud to make sure it is clear who is talking at each point in the conversation. (See: writing-pronouns)

said,
“replied {to him},” or “promised {him},” (See: writing-quotations)

“I will do according to your word.”
"I will do as/what you requested {of me}.” or “I will do exactly what you asked {me to do}.”


Gen 47:31 Then he said, “Swear to me.” And he swore to him. Then Israel bowed at the head of the bed.

Then he 
“But he” or “But his/Joseph’s father”. Consider what is the best way to refer to Joseph’s father Israel here in your language. (See: writing-pronouns)

said, 
“urged {him},” or “insisted,” (See: writing-quotations)

Swear to me.”
“Swear/Vow to me {by/before God/Yahweh} {that you will do it/that}.” or “{With God/Yahweh as your witness,} make an oath/vow to me {that you will do it/that}.” See how you translated “swear to me” in Gen 21:23.

And he swore to him. 
“So Joseph swore/vowed {that he would do it/that}.” or “So Joseph promised his father with an oath/vow {to do what he had requested}.” Make sure it is clear in your translation that Joseph is the one speaking here. (See: writing-pronouns)

Then Israel bowed
“Then Israel bowed {down} {to worship/thank God}” or “Then {his father} Israel bowed {his head} {and worshiped/thanked God}”. If it is not clear in your culture why Israel bowed, you could make that explicit. (See: translate-symaction)

at the head of the bed.
“{as he sat} at the head/top of {his} bed.” or “{as he was sitting/lying} on {his} bed.” The Hebrew text has “at the head of the bed” here, while the Septuagint (Greek translation of the Old Testament) has “on the top of his staff” instead, which is quoted in Hebrews 11:21. You could include some of that information in a footnote. The difference between versions may be due to the fact that the Hebrew words for “bed” and “staff” are very similar in spelling. Or it could be that Jacob did both; for example, he may have been sitting at the head of his bed and leaning on his staff when he bowed his head and worshiped God.

48:1-22 Jacob Blesses Joseph’s Sons Ephraim And Manasseh

Gen 48:1 Then it happened after those things that {someone} said to Joseph, “Behold, your father is sick.” So he took his two sons with him, Manasseh and Ephraim.

Then it happened after those things that
“{Some time} after those things happened,” Consider again how you translated these two phrases in the book of Genesis. See Gen 22:1, 20; 39:7; 40:1; 48:1. (See: writing-newevent)

{someone} said to Joseph, “Behold, your father is sick.” 
“{someone} told Joseph, “Look/Listen, your father is sick.” or “Joseph was told/informed {by someone} that his father was sick.” For some languages it may be more natural to use an indirect quote here. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-quotations)

So he
“So/Then he/Joseph”. Consider the best way to refer to Joseph here in your language. (See: writing-pronouns)

took his two sons with him, Manasseh and Ephraim.
“took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim with him {to visit his father}.” or “{went to visit his father and} took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim with him.”


Gen 48:2 And {someone} announced to Jacob and said, “Behold, your son Joseph has come to you.” Then Israel gathered his strength and sat up on the bed.

And {someone} announced to Jacob and said, “Behold, your son Joseph has come to you.”
“{When they got there,} {someone/they} informed/told Jacob, “Look, your son Joseph has come to see/visit you.” ” or “{When they arrived,} Jacob was informed/told {by someone} that his son Joseph had come to see/visit him.” (See: figs-quotations)

Then Israel 
“Then Israel” or “{Immediately} Israel{, who was lying down,}” Make sure it is clear in your translation or in a footnote that “Israel” (verses 2, 8, 11, 13-14, 21) and “Jacob” (verses 2-3) refer to the same person, not two different people.

gathered his strength
“rallied/mustered his strength” or “used all his strength” or “exerted himself”. Consider whether you language has a similar idiom that fits well here. (See: figs-idiom)

and sat up on the bed. 
“and sat up on/at {the edge/head of} {his} bed {and they greeted each other}.” The context (verse 12) shows that Jacob sat on the edge of his bed with his feet resting on the floor and his knees facing Joseph's sons. Also, for some languages it may be necessary (for politeness) to make it explicit that they greeted each other first before continuing their conversation. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-explicit)


Gen 48:3 Then Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and he blessed me 

Then Jacob said to Joseph, 
“Then Jacob recounted/related to Joseph {the following}:” or “Then Jacob told Joseph,” (See: writing-quotations)

“God Almighty 
“Almighty/All-powerful God” or “God {who is} all-powerful”. See how you translated this title in Gen 43:14.

appeared to me 
“appeared to me {long ago}” or “came to me in a vision {long ago}”. Consider again how you translated “appear” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 8:5; 12:7; 17:1; 18:1; 26:2, 24; 35:1, 9; 46:29; 48:3. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.

at Luz in the land of Canaan,
“{when I was} at {the town of} Luz in the land/region of Canaan,” or “in the land/region of Canaan at {the town of} Luz,” For some languages it is more natural to put the larger place (Canaan) first before the smaller place (Luz) that is located inside it. It may also be more natural to put the time and place phrases first in this verse and say, “{Long ago} {when I was} at {the town of} Luz in the land/region of Canaan, God Almighty....” Do what is best in your language. Also see how you spelled the name “Luz” in Gen 28:19 and 35:6. (See: figs-infostructure)

and he blessed me
“He blessed me {there}” or “He pronounced a blessing over me {there}”. For some languages it is more natural to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language.


Gen 48:4 and said to me, ‘Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you and make you into a community of peoples. And I will give this land to your offspring after you {as} an everlasting possession.’

and said to me, 
“by saying to me,” or “He said,” Make sure your translation of “blessed...and said” (verses 3-4) refers to the same event, not two separate events.

‘Behold, I will make you fruitful and multiply you and make you into 
 “Look/Listen, I will give you many descendants who will increase {in number} and become” or “Look/Listen, I will give you {and your descendants} many children so that your descendants will become”. See how you translated “make you fruitful and multiply you” in Gen 28:3 and “make him fruitful and...multiply him” in Gen 17:20.

a community of peoples.
“many people/ethnic groups.” See how you translated this phrase in Gen 28:3, and a similar phrase (“a community of nations”) in 35:11.

And I will give this land to your offspring after you
“I will {also} give this land to your descendants”

{as} an everlasting possession.’
“{as/for} an eternal/permanent possession.” or “to own forever.” or “and it will always belong to them.”

Gen 48:5 “And now, your two sons, who were born for you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, they {are} mine, Ephraim and Manasseh, just as Reuben and Simeon are mine.

“And now, your two sons, 
“{Then Jacob said to Joseph,} “Now then, your two sons”. The phrase “And now” shows that there is a change of topic. Make sure it is clear in your translation that Jacob is no longer quoting God's words in verse 5. (See: writing-quotations)

who were born for you 
“who were born to you” or “who were born”

in the land of Egypt 
“{here} in the land/country of Egypt” 

before I came to you in Egypt,
“before I joined you here,” or “before I arrived,” 

they {are} mine, Ephraim and Manasseh, 
“Ephraim and Manasseh, they {now} belong to me,” or “Ephraim and Manasseh, {will be} my sons,”

just as Reuben and Simeon are mine. 
“just as/like Reuben and Simeon are my sons.” or “just as/like my sons Reuben and Simeon.” For some languages it may be clearer and more natural to put the names of these sons earlier in the verse and say, “Now then, your two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were born to you here in the country of Egypt before I joined you here, {I will treat as} my sons, just as/like...” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 48:6 But your children whom you father after them will be yours. They will be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance. 

But your children whom you father after them 
“But any {other} children that you father/have later on” or “If you father/have any more/other children, they”

will be yours. 
“will belong to you.”

They will be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance.
“So they will share in some of what their brothers inherit {from me}.” or “{so that} what they inherit {from me} will be some of what their brothers {Ephraim and Manasseh} inherit {from me}.” Consider whether it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here or to continue the previous sentence.


Gen 48:7 And I, as I was coming from Paddan, Rachel died beside me in the land of Canaan on the way, while {there was} still a distance of land to go to Ephrath. And I buried her there beside the road of Ephrath, which {is} Bethlehem.”

And I, 
“I {want it this way because}” or “I {am doing this because}”. Jacob is probably explaining in verse 7 that since his favorite wife Rachel died with only two sons, that is why he is treating her son Joseph's two sons as his sons (verses 5-6). You could make some of that information explicit in your translation or include it in a footnote. (See: figs-explicit)

as I was coming
“as I {and our family} were coming/returning {home}” or “as our family was coming/returning {home}”. Jacob is in focus here, but he was traveling with his family, not alone. Decide whether or not it is necessary to make that explicit in your translation. (See: figs-explicit)

from Paddan,
“from {the land/region of} Paddan {Aram},” Consider again how you translated “{the land/region of} Paddan Aram” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 25:20 (and note); 28:2, 5-7; 31:18; 33:18; 35:9, 26; 46:15; 48:7. Also, be consistent with how you spelled “Aram” in those verses and in Gen 10:22-23; 22:21; 24:10.

Rachel 
“{your mother} Rachel” or “{my beloved wife} Rachel”

died beside me 
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here because the preposition can have different meanings. It can mean (1) “died beside me” or “died by my side” (2) “died, {bringing sorrow/grief} on/to me”

in the land of Canaan 
“in the region of Canaan”

on the way, while {there was} still a distance of land to go to Ephrath. 
“while we were still traveling and some distance away from {the town of} Ephrath.” Be consistent here with how you spelled “Ephrath” in Gen 35:16, 19, and how you spelled “Bethlehem” in 35:19.

And I buried her there beside the road of Ephrath, 
“{As you know,} I buried her body there by the road that goes to Ephrath,” 

which {is} Bethlehem.”
“which {now has the name} Bethlehem.” The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. This phrase might be (1) Jacob’s words (2) the author’s words. If you follow the second interpretation, you could put this phrase within parentheses, outside of the quote marks.

Gen 48:8 Then Israel saw the sons of Joseph and said, “Who {are} these?” 

Then Israel saw the sons of Joseph 
“Then Israel saw/noticed Joseph’s {two} sons”

and said, 
“and asked {him/Joseph},”

“Who {are} these?”
“Who {are} these {young men}?” or “Whose {sons} {are} these?” Joseph's two sons were in their 20s at this time, so refer to them here with a term that fits with that fact. They were born before the famine started (Gen 41:50-52), and Jacob had now been in Egypt for 17 years (47:28).


Gen 48:9 And Joseph said to his father, “They {are} my sons whom God has given to me in this {place}.” Then he said, “Please bring them to me, and I will bless them.”

And Joseph said to his father, 
“Joseph said/replied to him,” or “Joseph replied/answered,”

“They {are} my sons whom God has given to me 
“They/These {are} my sons whom God gave to me”

in this {place}.” 
“here {in Egypt}.”

Then he said, 
“Then Israel said {to Joseph/him},” Make sure it is clear in your translation who is speaking here. (See: writing-pronouns)

“Please bring them to me, 
“Please bring them {closer} to me”. Some languages have a dual pronoun that works well to refer to Joseph’s two sons here (and throughout chapter 48). Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-youdual)

and I will 
“so that I can” 

bless them.”
“{ask God to} bless/prosper them.”


Gen 48:10 Now the eyes of Israel were heavy from age, {so that} he was not able to see. So he brought them near to him, and he kissed them and embraced them. 

Now the eyes of Israel were heavy
“Now Israel’s eyes were weak/failing” or “Israel was almost blind” or “Israel had very poor/bad eyesight”. Consider whether or not it is natural in your language to use a conjunction (“Now”) to begin this clause that gives background information about Israel. Also, the word “heavy” is used here as an idiom that means Israel's eyesight was getting bad, but he could still see some (as indicated in verses 8 and 11). Many languages have a similar idiom. A translation of verse 10 should not imply that Israel was completely blind. (See: writing-background)

from age,
“because of old age,” or “because he was {very} old,”

{so that} he was not able to see. 
“{so that} he could not see {very clearly/well}.” For some languages it is more natural to switch the order of the clauses in this sentence and say, “Now Israel was {very} old, so his eyesight was failing and he was not able to see {very well}.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

So he brought them near to him,
“So Joseph brought/took his sons near/closer to his father,” or “So he/Joseph had his sons stand near/close to his father,” Make sure it is clear in your translation whom is being referred to at each point in this sentence. (See: writing-pronouns)

and he 
“and Israel” or “and his father”. It may be helpful to read this sentence aloud in your translation to make sure the use of nouns and pronouns is natural and accurate in your language. (See: writing-pronouns)

kissed them
“kissed them {on the cheeks/cheek}”

and embraced them.
“and hugged them.” Consider again how you translated the word “embraced” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 29:13; 33:4; 48:10. Also compare that to how you translated an idiom (“fell on...neck”) that has a similar meaning in Gen 33:4; 45:14, 46:29. It may be necessary to translate these terms in different ways, depending on the context.


Gen 48:11 Then Israel said to Joseph, “I did not expect to see your face, but behold, God has let me see also your offspring!” 

Then Israel said to Joseph, 
“Then Israel exclaimed to Joseph,” (See: writing-quotations)

“I did not expect to see your face, 
“I did not think I would ever see you {again},” or “I never thought I would see you {again},” 

but behold,
“but surprisingly/amazingly,” or “but {now} look,”

God has let me see also your offspring!” 
“God has allowed me to see/meet also/even your offspring/children!” or “God has also/even allowed me to see/meet your offspring/children!”


Gen 48:12 Then Joseph removed them from beside his knees, and he bowed down with his nose to the ground.

Then Joseph removed them 
“Then Joseph moved/took his sons away” or “Then Joseph had his sons move/step away/back”

from beside his knees
“from beside his father’s knees” or “from beside/near his father”. Joseph's sons (who were in their 20s) were near Jacob's knees, so that he could hug them; they were not sitting on his knees or lap. Also make sure it is clear that your translation of “his” refers to Jacob, not Joseph. (See: writing-pronouns)

and he bowed down 
“and he bowed {before him}” or “and he prostrated himself {before him}”

with his nose to the ground.
“with his nose/face toward the ground {in thankfulness and respect}.” or “and touched the ground with his forehead {to show respect}.” Joseph bowed to the ground to show thankfulness and respect to his father and possibly also to God. If necessary, you could make that information explicit in your translation or put it in a footnote. (See: translate-symaction)

_________________Paragraph Break_________________
 
Gen 48:13 Then Joseph took both of them, Ephraim on his right toward Israel’s left and Manasseh on his left toward Israel’s right, and brought {them} near to him.

Then Joseph took 
“Then Joseph/he took/positioned 

both of them,
“both of his sons,”

Ephraim on his right 
“{with} Ephraim on/at his right {hand/side}”

toward 
“facing” or “in front of”

Israel’s left
“Israel’s left {hand/side}”

and Manasseh on his left 
“and {with} Manasseh on/at his left {hand/side}”

toward 
“facing” or “in front of”

Israel’s right, 
“Israel’s right {hand/side},”

and brought {them} near to him. 
“and he brought/took {them} close to his father {again}.” For some languages it may be clearer or more natural to put this clause first in this verse and say, “Then he took/brought his sons close to his father {again}. He had Ephraim stand in front of Israel’s left {hand/side}, and he had Manasseh stand in front of Israel’s right {hand/side}.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 48:14 But Israel extended his right hand and placed {it} on the head of Ephraim, and he {was} the younger, and {he placed} his left hand on the head of Manasseh. He guided his hands, because Manasseh {was} the firstborn. 

But Israel extended his right hand 
“But Israel {intentionally} reached out his right hand”

and placed {it} on the head of Ephraim, 
“and put/rested/laid {it} on Ephraim’s head,”

and he {was} the younger, 
“even though Ephraim {was} the/{Joseph’s} younger {son}.”

and {he placed} his left hand on the head of Manasseh. He guided his hands,
“Then he {intentionally} {put/rested} his left hand on Manasseh’s head. He crossed his arms {to do that}” or “Then he crossed his arms and {put} his left hand on Manasseh’s head,” 
In the Hebrew culture, the right side was the place of highest honor and using the right hand to bless someone was symbolic of giving greater honor to that person. The oldest son was also the one who normally received the greater blessing. Israel reverses that here and gives Joseph's younger son the greater blessing. It may be important to include a footnote in your translation that gives this information. (See: translate-symaction)

because 
“{even} though” or “in spite of the fact that”. Make sure that the way you translate “because” fits with the fact that Israel wanted to place his right hand on Ephraim (to give him the greater blessing), even though Manasseh was the firstborn (who would normally receive the greater blessing in that culture).

Manasseh {was} the firstborn.
“Manasseh {was} the/{Joseph’s} firstborn/oldest {son}.” 


Gen 48:15 Then he blessed Joseph and said, “May the God whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked before, the God who has been shepherding me from since I {was born} until this day,

Then he blessed Joseph and said, 
“Then Israel blessed Joseph {and his sons} by saying,” or “Then Israel blessed Joseph by {blessing his sons and} saying,” Israel blessed Joseph by blessing Joseph’s sons (verses 15-16, 19-20).

“May the God
“May {God bless your sons,} the God” or “I pray that {God will bless your sons,} the God” or “I ask God {to bless your sons}. He is the God”. For some languages it is better to break up the long sentence in verses 15-16 and to also make it explicit here that Israel is asking God to bless Joseph’s sons, rather than wait until verse 16. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-explicit)

whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac 
“whom my forefathers/ancestors Abraham and Isaac” 

walked before, 
“walked/lived before/with {according to his will},” or “walked/lived {obediently} in the presence of,” or “served/obeyed,” See how you translated the idiom “walk/live before” in Gen 17:1 and 24:40. You may need to translate it differently in different contexts. (See: figs-idiom)

the God who has been shepherding me 
“the {same} God who has watched over me” or “He is the {same} God who has taken care of me”. The word “shepherded” includes guiding, protecting, and providing food and water, such as a shepherd would do for his sheep. Here it is used as a metaphor that refers to God’s complete care of Israel throughout his life. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to use a similar metaphor here. For example, you could say, “He is the {same} God who, for my entire life, has taken care of all my needs, just as a {good} shepherd takes care of his sheep.” (See: figs-metaphor)

from since I {was born} until this day,
“from {the beginning of} my {life} until the present day/time,” or “my entire life,”
 

Gen 48:16 the Angel who has redeemed me from all evil, may he bless {these} boys, and may my name be called in them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac, and may they grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.”

the Angel who has redeemed me from all evil, 
“{He is also} the Angel who saved/rescued me {continually} from all/every harm/trouble.” Consider whether it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Also consider again how you translated “angel” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 16:7, 9-11; 19:1, 15; 21:17; 22:11, 15; 24:7, 40; 28:12; 31:11; 32:3, 6; 48:16. (See: translate-key-terms)

may he 
“I pray/ask that he will”. Consider whether it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

bless {these} boys,
“cause {these} young men to prosper {greatly},” Since Joseph’s sons were probably in their 20s, make sure your translation of this phrase does not sound like they were little boys. The Hebrew word for “boy” here can also be translated as “lad, servant,” or “young man,” depending on the context and who is speaking to whom. With that in mind, consider again how you translated this word in the book of Genesis. See Gen 14:24; 18:7; 19:4; 21:12, 17-20; 22:3, 5, 12, 19; 25:27; 34:19; 37:2; 41:12; 43:8; 44:22, 30-34; 48:16.

and may my name be called in them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac, and may they grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.”
“so that my family name/line and the family name/line of my ancestors Abraham and Isaac will continue through them and so that they will have many descendants on the earth.” or “I pray that they will have many descendants on the earth who will carry on the family name/line for me and for my forefathers/ancestors Abraham and Isaac.”

Gen 48:17 And Joseph saw that his father had placed his right hand on the head of Ephraim, and it was displeasing in his eyes, so he took hold of the hand of his father to move it from on the head of Ephraim to the head of Manasseh. 

And Joseph saw that his father had placed his right hand on the head of Ephraim, and 
“{When} Joseph saw/noticed that his father had put/rested/laid his right hand on Ephraim’s head,” See how you translated “placed” in verse 14.

it was displeasing in his eyes, 
“it displeased him” or “he was displeased/unhappy {about it},” or “he thought it was a mistake,” 

so he took hold of the hand of his father 
“So he took hold of his father’s hand”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

to move it from on the head of Ephraim 
“{in order} to move/take it from Ephraim’s head” or “{and started} to move/take it from Ephraim’s head”

to the head of Manasseh.
“and {place/put it on} Manasseh’s head.”


Gen 48:18 And Joseph said to his father, “Not so, my father, because that {one} {is} the firstborn son. Put your right hand on his head.” 

And Joseph said to his father, 
“Then he said to his father,”

“Not so, my father, because that {one} {is} the firstborn son. 
“Not like that, Father. {It is} the other son {who is} the/my firstborn/oldest.“ or “That is the wrong one/son, Father. The other {one} {is} {my} firstborn/oldest son.”

Put your right hand on his head.”
“{So} {you need to} put/have your right hand on his head.”


Gen 48:19 But his father refused and said, “I know, my son, I know. He will also become a people, and he will also be great. Nevertheless his younger brother will be greater than he, and his offspring will become a multitude of nations.” 

But his father refused 
“But his father refused {to move his hands}” or “But his father would not {move his hands}”

and said,
“and replied,”

“I know, my son, I know.
“I know {it/that}, my son, I know {what I am doing}.” or “I know {what I am doing}, my son.”

He will also become a people, and he will also be great. 
“{In fact,} {the descendants of} your firstborn/oldest son will also become a people/ethnic group, and he will be/become a great/important man.” or “{In fact,} your firstborn/oldest son will also be/become a great/important man, and he will be/become {the ancestor of} a people/ethnic group.” Consider what is the best way in your language to refer to Joseph’s firstborn in these two clauses. (See: writing-pronouns)

Nevertheless his younger brother will be greater than he,
“However, his younger brother {Ephraim} will be {even} greater than he {will be},”

and his offspring 
“and his/Ephraim’s offspring/descendants” or “with {many} descendants, who”. Make sure your translation of this phrase is understood to refer to Ephraim’s descendants, not Manasseh’s.

will become a multitude of nations.”
“will become many people/ethnic groups.” Compare how you translated a similar phrase (“a community of peoples”) in verse 4.


Gen 48:20 And he blessed them on that day, saying, “By you Israel will bless {people}, saying, ‘May God make you like Ephraim and like Manasseh.’ ” So he put Ephraim before Manasseh.

And he blessed them on that day, 
“So Israel blessed Ephraim and Manasseh that day” or “That {same} day, Israel blessed {both of} them”

saying, 
“by saying {to them},” or “and said,” (See: writing-quotations)

“By you Israel will bless {people}, 
“{The people of} Israel will use your names when they bless {someone/people}” or “When {the people of} Israel say/pronounce a blessing over {someone}, they will use your names” 

saying,
“and say,”

May God 
“We ask God to”

make you 
“make you {great/prosperous}” or “bless/prosper you”

like Ephraim and like Manasseh.’ ”
“like {he blessed/prospered} Ephraim and Manasseh.”

So 
“In that way,” or “When he/Israel said that,”

he put Ephraim before Manasseh.
“he/Israel put/ranked Ephraim ahead of Manasseh.“ or “he/Israel made Ephraim greater than Manasseh.”

Gen 48:21 Then Israel said to Joseph, “Behold, I am dying, and God will be with you, and he will bring you back to the land of your fathers.

Then 
“Next” or “After that,”

Israel said to Joseph, 
“Israel {turned} to Joseph {and} said {to him},” or “Israel spoke to Joseph. {He said,}” (See: writing-quotations)

“Behold, 
“Look/Listen,” or “As you can see,”

I am dying,
“I am about to die,” or “I will die soon,”

and God will be with you, 
“but God will {always} be/stay with {all of} you {and help you},” or “but God will {always} be/stay with you and your brothers {and all your descendants} {and help you}.” The pronouns “you” and “your” are plural throughout this verse and probably refer to all Israel’s family, including Joseph, his brothers, and their descendants. (See: figs-yousingular)

and he will bring you back 
“He will also bring/take you back”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

to the land of your fathers.
“to the land that {he gave} to your forefathers/ancestors.”


Gen 48:22 And I give you Shechem, one {portion} above your brothers, which I took from the hand of the Amorite{s} with my sword and with my bow.”

And I give you 
“And I give/bequeath to you {as part of your inheritance}” or “Besides that, {as part of your inheritance from me,} I {hereby} give you”. The pronouns “you” and “your” shift to singular in verse 22.

Shechem, 
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could refer to (1) “{the city of} Shechem,” (2) “a mountain slope/ridge,” This second interpretation comes from the meaning of the Hebrew word “shekem” (“shoulder”), which can be used as a metaphor to refer to a mountain slope or ridge. (See: figs-metaphor)
   
one {portion} above your brothers,
“which is more {land} than I am giving to your brothers and”

which I took from the hand of
“which I took control of from” or “which I took/captured from” or “I took/captured that land from”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

the Amorite{s} with my sword and with my bow.”
“the Amorite{s} {in battle} using my sword and my bow.” or “the Amorite{s} when I defeated them in battle.” For some languages it may be clearer to change the order of clauses in this verse and say, “Besides that, I {hereby} give you {the city of} Shechem, {which} I took/captured from the Amorite{s} when I defeated them in battle. This is more {land} than I am giving to your brothers.” Do what is best in your language. Also consider again how you translated “Amorite{s}” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 10:16; 14:7, 13; 15:16, 21; 48:22. (See: figs-infostructure}
