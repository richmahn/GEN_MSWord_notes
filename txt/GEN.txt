1:1-2:3 How God Created Everything

Gen 1:1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

In the beginning
"At the beginning {of time/everything}" or "{Everything} began when". Many Bible scholars think that verse one records God's first act in creating the universe. This is also the traditional, historically-held view and fits with the narrative structure of the Hebrew text, as well as the wider context of Scriptures which states that God created everything out of nothing at the very beginning of the world (Psalm 33:6, 9; Hebrews 11:3). See the chapter introduction for more details about different interpretations of Genesis 1:1. Also, some languages must use a verb ("began") in verse 1 rather than a noun ("beginning"). Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-abstractnouns)

God
Translate the title "God" in a way that refers to the Supreme Being who created everything, who has complete power, who knows everything and is present everywhere. He is the only true God and has always existed. (See: translate-key-terms)

created
"made". In the Hebrew Bible, the verb "create" refers to an activity that only God does, and it often implies (as it does here) that he made something out of nothing. Also, the forms of the verbs in the Hebrew text (and the conjunctions) show that chapter one is a narrative that tells about true history and events in the order that things actually happened. Make sure that your translation does the same thing. (See: translate-key-terms)

the heavens
"the sky". This phrase refers here to the region where all the stars and planets would later exist. Keep that in mind as you translate this term. (See: translate-key-terms)

and the earth.
This phrase refers to the planet earth. (See: translate-key-terms)


Gen 1:2 Now the earth was formless and empty, and darkness {was} over the surface of the deep {waters}, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters. 

Now the earth
"Now {at first after that,} the earth" or "{At first after that,} the earth". The author pauses here to describe what the earth was like after God first created it (verse 1). Some languages use a conjunction like "Now" to introduce that information; other languages do not use a conjunction here. Do what is natural in your language. Also, be consistent here with how you translated "the earth" in verse 1.

was formless and empty,
It is not clear what the earth looked like at that time, but it did not have its present shape and order. Also, the Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) "was formless/shapeless and empty/desolate," or "did not have {its present} form, and there was nothing {living} on it {yet}," (2) "completely empty/desolate," which is a hendiadys. However it is best to keep both terms separate in your translation (as in the first interpretation). 

and darkness {was} over the surface of the deep {waters},
"It was {totally/completely} dark, there was deep {water} {everywhere}," or "There was deep {water} {everywhere} {that was covered/surrounded} in/by {complete/total} darkness," For some languages it is more natural to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language.

and the Spirit of God was hovering
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) "and God's Spirit was hovering/moving" (2) "and a wind from God was blowing" (3) "and a powerful wind was blowing". The first interpretation is most likely, since the Hebrew verb "hovering" does not describe what wind does.

over the surface of the waters.
"over the surface of the water." or "above the waters/water." Throughout this chapter, the word "waters" is in the plural in the Hebrew text. For some languages it is more natural to use the singular "water". Do what is best in your language in each context.


Gen 1:3 Then God said, "Let there be light." And there was light.

Then God said,	
"Then God commanded," What God says in verse 3 is a command. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to make that explicit in this quote margin. (See: writing-quotations)

"Let there be light."
"Let light exist." or "I command there to be light." or "I command light to start shining!" This is a command, not permission or a suggestion. It is a direct quote of what God actually said, and it is usually put between quotation marks in a translation. If you use an exclamation mark with this command in your translation, make sure it does not mean or imply that God was angry. Also, the way you translate "light" should refer to what shines from a source of light; it does not refer here to the source itself.

And there was light.
"And/So {immediately} there was light." or "And {so/immediately} light started shining." Light began to shine immediately as a result of God's command.


Gen 1:4 And God saw the light, that {it was} good. Then God separated between the light and the darkness.

And God saw
"And he saw/observed" or "God/He saw/observed". Notice that Hebrew frequently uses a conjunction such as "And" or "Then" at the beginning of a sentence. Some languages do not use conjunctions as frequently as Hebrew does. Do what is accurate and natural in your language in each context. (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)

the light, that {it was} good.
"that the light {was} good/excellent." In the Bible, "good" is an important theme. Throughout chapter one, it especially means that what God created was high quality, complete, and had no defects; in other words, it had all the characteristics and functions that God intended it to have. It also includes the idea that what God created was untainted by sin and reflected his good character (Psalm 19:1; Romans 1:20). The focus here is not on how pleased or satisfied God was. (See: translate-key-terms)

Then God
"Then he". In order to produce an accurate and natural translation, it is important in each context to make sure that nouns (such as "God") and pronouns (such as "he") are used properly in your language. In the Hebrew text, "God" is repeated frequently in chapter one to emphasize him and show that he is in focus. For some languages it is more natural to say "God" only once at the beginning of each paragraph or section, and then use pronouns to refer to him the rest of the time (or most of the time). Throughout chapter one, do what is best in your language each time that God is referred to. (See: writing-pronouns)

separated between the light and the darkness.
"separated/divided the light from the darkness {so that each had its own time}." or "caused the light to have its own time and the darkness to have its own time." or "separated the light from the darkness {so that it would be light for a number of hours, and then dark for a number of hours}."

   
Gen 1:5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. Then there was evening and there was morning, one day.

And God called
"Then God/he called/named" or "God/He called/named". Some languages omit the connecting word "And" or "Then" here. Consider the best way in your language to connect this sentence with the previous one. (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)

the light Day,
"the light Daytime." Notice that in this context the word "Day" refers only to the time when the sun is shining, not to the 24-hour time period that makes up a complete day. Make sure that this is clear in your translation. Throughout chapter one, some translations use quote marks around the names that God gives the different things he created.

and the darkness he called Night.
"and the darkness he called/named Nighttime." or "and he called/named the darkness Nighttime." In the Hebrew text, "the darkness" is first in this clause to emphasize the contrast between the light and the darkness. Consider the best way to translate this clause in your language.

Then there was evening, and there was morning,
"Then evening came and {then/later} morning came," The evening and the morning are the parts of a 24-hour day that separate the hours of daytime (light) from the hours of nighttime (darkness): Evening came at the end of each daytime after God finished his work of creating. Then after about 12 hours of nighttime, morning came, which began the next 12 hours of daytime when God did more work. Make sure your translation does not sound like morning came immediately after evening. Some languages have a one-word conjunction that means "and then" or "and later" that fits well here. (See: grammar-connect-time-sequential)
   
one day.
"{and that was} day one." or "{and that was} {the end of} the first day." Here "day" refers to a full 24-hour day. Also, the Hebrew text uses a cardinal number ("one") here, but then uses ordinal numbers ("second", "third", and so on) for the rest of the days of creation week. Some languages need to use an ordinal number ("first") here too. Other languages use cardinal numbers throughout ("day one", "day two", and so on). Do what is best in your language. (See: translate-ordinal)

Gen 1:6 Then God said, "Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters."

Then God said,
"Then God commanded," See how you translated this phrase in verse 3. (See: writing-quotations)
   
"Let there be an expanse
"Let there be a large/vast space" or "I command there to be a {large/vast} expanse/space" or "I command a large/vast space to form/exist". The Hebrew word for "expanse" here describes a large space that is "spread out." It was not solid, rather it was open and empty and could be seen through and flown through (verse 20). It was probably also curved, following the spherical shape of the earth. See how you translated "Let there be" in verse 3.

in the middle of the waters,
"in the middle of the water," See how you translated "waters" in verse 2.
   
and let it separate the waters from the waters."
"and let it separate/divide the water {above it} from the water {below it}." or "so that it separates/divides the waters/water into two separate/different places."


Gen 1:7 So God made the expanse and separated between the waters that {were} under the expanse and the waters that {were} above the expanse. And it was so.

So God made
"In that way God/he made/created" or "That is how God/he made/created". Verse 7 explains what God's command in verse 6 caused to happen, and it repeats some of the same words and phrases. Make sure that your translation of these verses does not sound like God created the expanse twice.

the expanse 
"a large/vast space"

and separated
"and divided" or "and used it to separate/divide"

between the waters that {were} under the expanse and the waters that {were} above the expanse.
"the water that {was} below the expanse/space from the water that {was} above it." or "the water that {was} under/below it from the water that {was} above it." For some languages it is more natural to use a pronoun ("it") here to refer to the expanse, since it was just mentioned earlier in the verse. Each language has its own system of when to use nouns or pronouns to refer to people, places and things. In each context, do what is clear and natural in your language. (See: writing-pronouns)

And it was so.
"That is the way it happened." or "Everything was/happened {exactly} as he commanded {it to be/happen}." (See: figs-explicit)


Gen 1:8 And God called the expanse Heavens. Then there was evening, and there was morning, the second day. 

And God called
"and God/he called/named" or "God/He called/named". Consider whether it is more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here (with or without a conjunction), or to continue the sentence that began at the end of verse 7. Also see how you translated this phrase in verse 5. (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)

the expanse
"the large/vast space". See how you translated this phrase in verses 6 and 7.
   
Heavens.
"Sky." This word probably refers here to the atmosphere above the earth's surface where clouds are and where birds fly, as well as the space where the sun, moon, and stars are now. See how you translated this term in verse 1. (See: translate-key-terms)

Then there was evening, and there was morning,
"Then evening came and {then/later} morning came," See how you translated this sentence in verse 5, and see the note about that there.
   
the second day.
"{and that was} {the end of} the second day." or "{and} the second day ended." or "{and that was} {the end of} day two." Consider whether it is more natural in your language to use an ordinal number ("second") here or a cardinal number ("two"). (See: translate-ordinal)

__________________________Paragraph Break________________________________

Gen 1:9 Then God said, "Let the waters under the heavens be gathered to one place, and let the dry ground appear." And it was so.
   
Then God said,
"Then God commanded," See how you translated this phrase in verses 3 and 6. (See: writing-quotations)

"Let the waters under the heavens be gathered
"Let the water {that is} under the heavens/sky gather/come together" or "I command the water {that is} below the heavens/sky to gather/come together". Consider whether it is better here in your language to use a passive form of the verb ("be gathered") or an active form ("gather" or "come"). (See: figs-activepassive)

to one place,
"in one place/area" or "into one area"

and let the dry ground appear."
"so that there is dry ground/land." or "so that dry ground/land can be seen." or "so that land is uncovered and dries off." The water had been covering the land, so when the water receded from it, the land became exposed and dried off. Make sure that the way you translate "dry ground" does not sound like the land was dry while it was under the water.
   
And it was so.
"And that is {exactly} what happened." or "And it was/happened {exactly} as God commanded {it to be/happen}." See how you translated this sentence in verse 7. It may be necessary to translate it in different ways, depending on the context.
   

Gen 1:10 And God called the dry ground Land, and the gathered waters he called Seas. And God saw that {it was} good.

And God called 
"Then God/he called/named"

the dry ground
"the dry land" or "the ground/land that had dried off"

Land,
"Ground," This is the same Hebrew word that is translated as "earth" in verse 1, but here it refers to the dry land or ground (in contrast to the water), not the entire planet.

and the gathered waters he called
"and the waters/water that he had gathered together he called/named" or "and he called/named the gathered waters" or "and he called/named the waters/water that had gathered/come together". See how you translated a sentence in verse 5 that is similar in structure to this sentence. (See: figs-infostructure)

Seas.
"Oceans." or "Sea/Ocean." At that time there was probably just one very large body of water and one very large land mass on the earth (as verse 9 indicates). So a singular noun that refers to the largest body of water, such as "Ocean" or "Sea", could be used here in your translation.

And God saw 
"And he saw/observed" or "God/He saw/observed". Decide whether it is more natural in your language to use a noun ("God") or a pronoun ("he") in this context. See how you translated this phrase in verse 4. (See: writing-pronouns)

that {it was} good.
"that {what he had made was} good/excellent." or "that {the land and the seas/ocean were} good/excellent." Some languages cannot use a pronoun ("it") here, but have to specify what was good. Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated the word "good" in verse 4, and see the note about that there.

Gen 1:11 Then God said, "Let the land sprout vegetation: {every} plant yielding seed, {every} fruit tree bearing fruit according to its kind, that {has} its seed inside it, on the earth." And it was so.

Then God said,
"Then God commanded," (See: writing-quotations)

"Let the land
"I command the land/ground to" or "The land/ground must now". Notice that when God commands the land to do something, it obeys him. See how you translated "Land" in verse 10.

sprout vegetation:
"grow/produce {green} plants," or "be covered with {green} plants," The Hebrew word for "vegetation" refers generally here to any kind of green plant and includes the plants and trees that are mentioned next in this verse.

{every} plant yielding seed,
"{including} {every kind/type of} plant that produces/has seeds" or "{including} {all kinds/types of} plants that produce/have seeds". This phrase refers to many different kinds of plants, not just one plant or one seed. Make sure that is clear in your translation. Also, these kinds of plants have soft stems and include vegetable plants, herbs and other plants that produce edible seeds, such as rice, corn and wheat.

{every} fruit tree bearing fruit according to its kind,
"{and} fruit trees that bear/produce fruit, {each} according to its {own} kind/type," or "{and} {every kind/type of} fruit tree that bears/produces/has its own kind/type of fruit" or "{and} {all kinds/types of} fruit trees that bear/produce/have their own kind/type of fruit". The phrase "according to its kind" emphasizes that each different kind of tree produces its own kind of fruit and seeds, which grow and become only that kind of tree. For example, apple trees always produce apples with apple seeds, never peaches or cherries, or any other kind of fruit or seeds.

that {has} its seed inside it,
"that {has} seeds inside," or "with seeds inside," or "with its {own kind/type of} seeds inside it," 

on the earth."
"throughout the earth." or "all over the earth." For some languages it is clearer and more natural to put this phrase earlier in this verse and say, "Let the land sprout vegetation on/throughout the earth..." Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

And it was so.
"And that is {exactly} what happened:" or "And it/everything happened {exactly} as God commanded {it to happen}:" Either a period or a colon can be used here, but a colon more clearly shows that verse 12 gives the details of what happened. This is different from verse 7 where the details of what happened come before "And it was so", and from verse 9 where no additional details are given.


Gen 1:12 So the land brought out vegetation: {every} plant yielding seed according to its kind, and {every} tree bearing fruit that {has} its seeds inside it, according to its kind. And God saw that {it was} good.

So the land brought out vegetation:
"The land sprouted/produced vegetation/plants," or "The land started growing/producing {green} plants," Verse 12 explains what God's command in verse 11 caused to happen, and it repeats some of the same words and phrases. Make sure that your translation of these verses does not sound like God created the plants twice.
	
{every} plant yielding seed according to its kind,
"{including} plants that produce/have seeds, {each} according to its {own} kind/type," or "{including} {every kind/type of} plant that produces/has seeds that grow into the same kind/type of plant," or "{including} {all kinds/types of} plants that produce/have their own kind/type of seeds,"

and {every} tree bearing fruit that {has} its seeds inside it, according to its kind.
"and trees that bear/produce fruit with seeds inside, {each} according to its {own} kind" or "and {every kind/type of} tree that produces/has fruit with seeds that grow into the same kind/type of tree." or "and {all kinds/types of} trees that {produce/have} their own kind/type of seed-bearing fruit."

And God saw
"And he saw/observed" or "God/He saw/observed". Consider whether or not it is more natural in your language to begin this sentence with a conjunction. (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)

that {it was} good.
"that {what he had made/created was} good/excellent." or "that {all the plants and trees were} good/excellent." See how you translated this clause in verse 10. Some languages have to specify what was good. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-explicit)


Gen 1:13 Then there was evening, and there was morning, the third day.
 
Then there was evening, and there was morning,
"Then evening came and {then/later} morning came," See how you translated this sentence in verses 5 and 8.

Gen 1:14 Then God said, "Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate between the day and the night. And let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years.

Then God said, 
"Then God commanded," (See: writing-quotations)

"Let there be lights 
"Let lights/lamps appear/exist" or "I command there to be sources of light" or "Let there be things/objects that give/shine light". These lights refer to the sun, moon and stars that give off light. But it is important to keep this general in your translation (like the Hebrew text does) and not specify the names of these lights.

in the expanse of the heavens
"in the expanse/space of/called the heavens/sky" or "in the open space of the heavens/sky" or "in the heavens/sky". The expanse is the same thing as the heavens (verse 8), so some translations leave "the expanse of" implied here. Do what is best in your language. 

to separate
"to divide/distinguish" or "that separate/divide"

between the day and the night.
"the day{time} from the night{time}." See how you translated "Day{time}" and "Night{time}" in verse 5.

And let them be for 
"Let those lights/lamps also be" or "They must/will also serve/function as" or "I also command those lights/lamps to serve/function as" 

signs, and for 
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) "signs/markers {of special/important events}, and {they must/will} mark" or "mark/indicate when important things happen, and {they must/will} mark" (2) "signs/markers that mark/indicate/show". The word "signs" means that the lights can mark certain times of the year. Following the first interpretation, the lights are to also mark special events (such as the star that signaled Jesus' birth and the darkened sun at Jesus' death). 

seasons, and for days and years.
"seasons, days and years." or "when seasons, days and years begin {and end}." The sun and moon show the passing of time. For example, the 30-day month is determined by the phases of the moon, and the 365-day year is determined by the time it takes for the earth to travel around the sun. Seasons are regular times of the year, such as seed-planting and harvesting times, and the seasons of spring, summer, fall and winter (Genesis 8:22), as well as the special festivals which God appointed for his people to meet with him. You could put some of that information in a footnote.
   

Gen 1:15 And let them be as lights in the expanse of the heavens to shine on the earth." And it was so.

And let them be as
"And they must/will be" or "They must/will serve/function as" or "Their purpose is to serve/function as"

lights
"sources of light"
   
in the expanse of the heavens
"in the expanse/space called the heavens/sky" or "in the open space of the heavens/sky" or "in the heavens/sky". See how you translated this phrase in verse 14.

to shine on the earth."
"to/that shine {light} on the earth." or "so that they provide/give light to/for the earth." See how you translated "the earth" in verses 1-2.
   
And it was so.
"And that is {exactly} what happened." or "And it was/happened {exactly} as he commanded {it to be/happen}."


Gen 1:16 So God made the two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night, and the stars.

So God made
"In that way God/he made/created" or "That is how God/he made/created". Verses 16-18 explain what God's commands in verses 14-15 caused to happen. Make sure your translation of these verses does not sound like he created the lights twice. See how you translated "So God made" in verse 7.
   
the two great lights,
"the two bright/big lights," This phrase refers to the sun and the moon, which are the two brightest objects in the earth's sky. However the author intentionally does not use their names, so you should not include their names in your translation either.

the greater light 
"the stronger/brighter light". The focus is on the relative brightness or strength of the lights, not on their size.

to rule the day, 
"to dominate/govern the day," or "to shine during the day," The word "rule" is a figure of speech that means each light has the greatest effect during a particular time period because it is the brightest light that is shining then. For some languages, nonliving objects like the sun and the moon cannot "rule" because only people can do that. Do what is accurate and natural in your language. (See: figs-personification)

and the lesser light 
"and the weaker/dimmer light"

to rule the night,
"to dominate/govern the night," or "to shine during the night," Be consistent here with how you translated "rule" previously in this verse.

and the stars.
"and {he also made/created} the stars." or "{That is} also {when he made/created} the stars." The verb "made" that is used earlier in the verse is implied here. Translate this in a way that is clear and natural in your language. (See: figs-ellipsis)


Gen 1:17 And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to shine on the earth,

And God 
"God/He". Consider the best way in your language to refer to God in this context. (See: writing-pronouns)

set them
"placed/put them" or "placed/put the lights". Consider the best way in your language to refer to the lights in this context. (See: writing-pronouns)

in the expanse of the heavens
"in the expanse/space called the heavens/sky" or "in the open space of the heavens/sky" or "in the heavens/sky". See how you translated this phrase in verses 14 and 15. 

to shine on the earth,
"to shine light on the earth," or "to provide/give light to/for the earth," See how you translated this phrase in verse 15.


Gen 1:18 and to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate between the light and the darkness. And God saw that {it was} good.

and to rule over the day and over the night,
"and to govern/dominate the day{time} and/or the night{time}," or "and to shine during the day{time} and/or during the night{time}," Make sure that your translation of the word "day" refers here to the daytime hours, not an entire 24-hour day. Also see how you translated "rule" in 1:16. (See: figs-personification)

and to separate between the light and the darkness.
"and to divide/distinguish the light from the darkness." or "and to separate/distinguish the time of light from the time of darkness." Consider again how you translated "separate" in verses 4, 6-7, 14 and 18.

And God saw 
"And he saw/observed" or "God/He saw/observed"

that {it was} good.
"that {what he had made/created was} good/excellent." or "that {the lights in the heavens/sky were} good/excellent." Some languages need to specify what was good. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-explicit)


Gen 1:19 Then there was evening, and there was morning, the fourth day.

Gen 1:20 Then God said, "Let the waters swarm {with} swarm{s} of living creature{s}, and let bird{s} fly above the earth across the face of the expanse of the sky."

Then God said,
"Then God commanded," (See: writing-quotations)

"Let the waters swarm {with} swarm{s} of living creature{s},
"I command the water to be full of large numbers/groups of living creatures," or "I command there to be large numbers/groups of {water} animals that live everywhere in the water," 

and let bird{s} fly
"and let there be birds that fly" or "I also command there to be birds that fly" or "Also let there be winged creatures that fly". The Hebrew word for "birds" can also be more general and refer to "winged/flying creatures," which includes birds, bats, flying insects and even flying reptiles that are now extinct. Consider whether it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

above the earth across the face of the expanse of the sky."
"above the earth, through the sky/air." or "across/in/through the sky above the earth."


Gen 1:21 So God created the great sea creatures and every living creature that moves which the waters swarm with according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that {it was} good.

So God created
"That is how God/he created/made" or "In that way God/he created/made". See how you translated "created" in verse 1. (See: writing-pronouns)

the great sea creatures
"the huge/gigantic sea/ocean animals". These include whales, sharks, giant squid, crocodiles, and leviathans (Psalm 74:13-14, Isaiah 27:1), which were probably swimming reptiles that are now extinct.
 
and every living creature that moves
"and every {kind/type of fish and every other} creature/animal that moves/lives" or "and all the {fish and other} {kinds/types of} creatures/animals that move/live"

which the waters swarm with
"throughout the water/ocean in large numbers/groups," or "in the water and fills it," or "all over the place in the water/ocean,"

according to their kind,
"{each} according to its {own} kind/type," or "{each} that produces/has its own kind/type {of offspring/young}," This phrase emphasizes that each different kind of creature has its own distinct kind of offspring/young. For example, whales always give birth to whales, and never give birth to cats or cows, or any other kind of creature.

and
"and {how he created/made}" or "{That is} also {how he created/made}". For some languages it is more natural to begin a new sentence here, so that the previous sentence is not too long. Do what is best in your language.

every winged bird
"every {kind/type of} bird" or "all {the different kinds/types of} birds" or "every {kind/type of} winged creature". See how you translated "birds" in verse 20.

according to its kind.
"{each} according to its {own} kind/type." or "{each} that produces/has its own kind/type {of young}." See how you translated this phrase earlier in this verse.

And God saw 
"And He saw/observed" or "God/He saw/observed"

that {it was} good.
"that {what he had created/made was} good/excellent." or "that {the water animals and the birds were} good/excellent." Some languages need to specify what was good. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-explicit)


Gen 1:22 Then God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let the bird{s} multiply on the earth."

Then God blessed them,
"Then God caused them {all} to prosper/flourish" or "Then God blessed the water creatures/animals and the birds". For some languages it is necessary to specify who "them" refers to. Do what is best in your language. (See: writing-pronouns)

saying,
"by saying {to them}," or "and said {first to the water animals}," God blesses the water animals first. If that is not clear, you could make that explicit here in the quote margin or at the beginning of what God says. (See: figs-explicit)
   
"Be fruitful 
"Reproduce" or "You water animals must/will produce/have many babies/young". God speaks directly to the water animals using the second person ("you"), then later in the verse speaks about the birds in the third person ("the birds"). For some languages it is necessary to use either second person for both or third person for both, to prevent confusion. Do what is natural and clear in your language. (See: figs-123person)

and multiply
"so that you {and your offspring/descendants} {will} multiply/increase {greatly} {in number}" or "so that you {and your offspring/descendants} {will} become {very} numerous/many" (See: grammar-connect-logic-goal)
   
and fill
"and live all over the place in" or "and live throughout"

the waters in the seas,
"the water in/of the sea/ocean" or "the ocean/water". For some languages, "water in the seas" is too repetitive, so it is more natural here to just say "seas/sea" or "ocean" or "water". Do what is best in your language.
   
and let the bird{s}
"And the birds must/will {also}" or "{You} birds must/will {also}". Consider whether it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
   
multiply
"increase {greatly} in number" or "become {very} numerous/many". See how you translated "multiply" earlier in this verse.

"throughout the earth." or "{and live} all over the earth."


Gen 1:23 Then there was evening, and there was morning, the fifth day.

Then there was evening, and there was morning, 
"Then evening came and {then/later} morning came,"

the fifth day.
"{and that was} {the end of} the fifth day." or "and the fifth day ended."
 or "{and that was} {the end of} day five." (See: translate-ordinal) 

__________________________Paragraph Break________________________________

Gen 1:24 Then God said, "Let the land bring forth {every} living creature according to its kind: livestock and {every} crawling creature and {every} creature of the earth, {each} according to its kind." And it was so.

Then God said,
"Then God commanded,"

"Let the land
"I command the land/ground to" or "The land/ground must now". See how you translated a similar command to the land in verse 11.

bring forth
"produce/yield"
   
{every} living creature
"{every kind/type of} living creature/animal" or "{all kinds/types of} creatures/animals," This is a general term that refers to all the different kinds of creatures/animals that breathe, including the three large categories of animals mentioned below in this verse.

according to its kind:
"{each} that bears/has its own kind/type of offspring/young," or "{each} bearing/having its own kind/type of offspring/young," This phrase means that every kind of animal that God created always produces young that are the same kind of animal as their parents. See how you translated this phrase in verse 21, and see the note about that there.

livestock
"{including} domestic/farm/tame animals," This term probably includes animals such as horses, camels, cattle, sheep and goats that people raise for food or use for farming or other work. This is in contrast to animals that normally live in the wild.

and {every} crawling creature
"{every} {kind/type of} creature/animal that crawls" or "{all kinds/types of} creatures/animals that crawl"

and {every} creature of the earth,
"and {every} {other} {kind/type of} {wild/untamed} creature/animal {that lives} on the earth/land," or "and {all} the {other} {kinds/types of} {wild/untamed} animals {that live} on the earth/land," This phrase refers in general to animals that are normally not raised by people, but live in the wild.

{each} according to its kind."
"{each} that bears/has its own kind/type of offspring/young." or "{each} having its own kind/type of offspring/young." See how you translated this phrase earlier in this verse.

And it was so.
"And that is {exactly} what happened." or "It/Everything happened {exactly} as he commanded {it to happen}."


Gen 1:25 So God made {every} creature of the earth according to its kind, and the livestock according to its kind, and every crawling creature of the ground according to its kind. And God saw that {it was} good.

So God made
"That is how God made/created" or "In that way God made/created"

{every} creature of the earth 
"{every kind/type of} wild/untamed creature/animal," or "{all the different kinds/types of} wild/untamed creatures/animals," See how you translated "{every} creature of the earth" in verse 24.

according to its kind,
"{each} that bears/has its own kind/type of offspring/young," or "{each} having its own kind/type of offspring/young,"

and the livestock 
"and {every kind/type of} domestic/farm/tame animal," or "and {all} the domestic/farm/tame animals," See how you translated "livestock" in verse 24.

according to its kind,
"{each} that bears/has its {own} kind/type of offspring/young," or "{each} having its {own} kind/type of offspring/young,"

and every crawling creature of the ground
"and every {kind/type of} creature/animal that crawls on/along the ground," or "and all {different kinds/types of} creatures/animals that crawl on/along the ground," See how you translated "crawling creature" in verse 24.

according to its kind.
"{each} that bears/has its own kind/type of offspring/young." or "{each} having its {own} kind/type of offspring/young," Consider again how you translated this phrase in verses 11, 12, 21, 24 and 25. It may be necessary to translate this phrase in different ways, depending on the context.

And God saw
"And he saw/observed" or "God/He saw/observed" 

that {it was} good.
"that {what he had made/created was} good/excellent." or "that {all the creatures/animals that he had made/created were} good/excellent." Some languages need to specify what was good. Consider again how you translated "And God saw that...good" in verses 10, 12, 18, 21, 25. (See: figs-explicit)

__________________________Paragraph Break________________________________

Gen 1:26 Then God said, "Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the bird{s} of the sky and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every moving creature that moves on the earth." 

Then God said,
"Then God said {to himself}," Here God is not commanding anything to happen, but is getting ready to personally create mankind himself (the details are given in Gen 2:7, 21-22). Some languages have to specify who is being spoken to. Do what is best in your language. (See: writing-quotations)

"Let us make
"{Now} we should/will make/create". Most Bible scholars think that the plural pronouns ("us", "our") in this verse refer to God and reflect the fact that he is three Persons in one God. So it is best to keep these pronouns plural in your translation. Also, many translations capitalize the first letter of all pronouns that refer to God in order to show him honor and respect. Your translation team needs to decide whether or not you will do that, too. Be consistent with your decision as you translate the Bible.

man
"mankind/humankind" or "human beings". The Hebrew word for "man" is used here (and in verse 27) as a collective noun that refers to human beings in general, including male and female.

in our image, according to our likeness,
"to be like us and act like us," or "to be like us, so that they are similar to us in many ways," These two phrases have similar meanings and emphasize that God made mankind to be like himself in many ways. (See: figs-doublet)

and let them rule over
"and let us put them in charge of" or "We will give them authority to rule/oversee/manage"

the fish of the sea 
"the fish of/in the sea/ocean,"

and over the bird{s} of the sky
"the birds {that fly} in the sky/air," Some translations leave out the phrase "of the sky" because it is strongly implied and may not sound natural in their languages. However, if it is natural in your language, it is best to include this phrase, because the author repeatedly contrasts three large categories of animals in this section: creatures that live on the ground, creatures that swim in the water, and creatures that fly in the sky. 

and over the livestock
"the domestic/farm/tame animals," Consider again how you translated "livestock" in verses 24-26.

and over all the earth
"and the entire earth," This refers to the planet earth and everything on it, including water, soil, metals, minerals and other resources, as well as all the plants and animals.

and over every moving creature that moves on the earth."
"including every creature/animal that moves/lives on the earth." or "and/including all the creatures/animals that move/live on the earth." For some languages it is not natural to repeat "and" or "over" with each item in this list. Consider the best way to translate a list like this in your language.


Gen 1:27 Then God created man in his image. In the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.

Then God created
"So God created/made". In this verse God does what he said he was going to do (verse 26). Make sure your translation does not sound like God created mankind twice. Also see how you translated "created" in verses 1 and 21. (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)
   
man
"mankind/humankind" or "human beings". Be consistent here with how you translated this term in verse 26. (See: translate-key-terms)
   
in his image. 
"in his own image." or "to be like himself." or "to be similar to himself {in many ways}." God made mankind to be like himself in some ways (not all ways) and to represent him in the world and show people what he is like. For example, God gave human beings an eternal spirit and the ability to have a relationship with him. He also gave us emotions, an understanding of right and wrong, and the ability to reason and make choices, to create new things and to have authority over the rest of creation.
   
In the image of God he created him;
"{Yes/Indeed,} he created/made them in his image" or "{Indeed} God/he created/made them to be like himself" or "{Yes,} God/he created/made them to be similar to himself {in many ways}". The pronoun "him" refers to the collective noun "man", which in this case refers to human beings in general, not just one person. Also, this clause is the second half of a chiasm (an inverted parallelism) that repeats the first part of verse 27 in reverse order, to emphasize that it was in God's image that human beings were created. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-parallelism)

male and female he created them. 
"He {also} created/made them {to be} male or female." The phrase "male and female" comes first in the Hebrew text in order to emphasize it. Do what is accurate and natural in your language. Also make sure your translation of this verse does not sound like God is both male and female. (See: figs-figs-infostructure)

__________________________Paragraph Break________________________________

Gen 1:28 Then God blessed them, and God said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it. And rule over the fish of the sea and over the bird{s} of the sky and over every living creature that moves on the earth." 

Then God blessed them 
"Then God showed his favor to them" or "Then God caused them to prosper/flourish". See how you translated "blessed" in verse 22.
   
and God said to them,
"and said," or "by saying to them," or "by saying," or "He said," Make sure it is clear in your translation of this quote margin that what God says next is the way that he blessed mankind, not something he said separately from that. (See: writing-quotations)
   
"Be fruitful 
"Bear/Have many children" or "You will bear/have many children". See how you translated "Be fruitful and multiply" in verse 22. It may be necessary to translate the phrase in different ways, depending on the context.

and multiply,
"so that you {and your descendants} {will} multiply/increase {greatly} {in number}" or "so that you {and your descendants} {will} become {very} numerous/many" (See: grammar-connect-logic-goal)

and fill the earth
"and live all over the earth" or "and inhabit the whole earth" or "Fill the earth". For some languages, it is more natural to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language.
   
and subdue it.
"and take control/care of it." or "and bring it under your control." 
   
And rule over
"You must rule over" or "You are in charge of" or "I am giving you authority to rule/oversee/manage". See how you translated "rule" in verse 26.

the fish of the sea and over the bird{s} of the sky
"the fish in the ocean, the birds {that fly} in the sky/air," See how you translated these phrases in verse 26.
   
and over every living creature that moves on the earth."
"and every creature/animal that moves/lives on the earth/land." or "and all the creatures/animals that move/live on the earth/land." This phrase refers generally here to every kind of creature that lives on land.


Gen 1:29 Then God said, "Behold, I have given to you every plant {that} yields seed that is on the surface of the whole earth and every tree that {bears} fruit {that} yields seed inside it. They will be yours for food.

Then God said,
"Then God/he {also} said {to them}," or "Then God/he continued/added," God is still speaking to the human beings, so it may be necessary to add "also" to this quote margin. Some languages need to specify who is being spoken to. Other languages may leave this quote margin implied, since the same subject (God) is talking to the same people. However the repeated quote margin in the Hebrew text could show that God paused before continuing or that he is changing the topic, or to emphasize what he says next. So if it is natural to keep the quote margin here in your language, that is best. (See: writing-quotations)

"Behold,
"Look/Listen," or "Listen to this," or "I want you to know that". This word means that what God says next is important and should be given special attention. Consider the best way to translate this term in your language. (See: translate-key-terms)

I have given to you
"I am {now} giving to you {as/for food}" or "I have provided {as food} for you" or "I am {now} providing {as food} for you"

every plant {that} yields seed that is
"every {kind/type of} seed-bearing plant that grows" or "every {kind/type of} plant with seeds that grows" or "all the {different kinds/types of} plants that yield/produce seeds and grow". See how you translated a similar phrase in verses 11 and 12.

on the surface of the whole earth
"anywhere on/throughout the earth,"

and every tree that {has}
"as well as every {kind/type of} tree that {bears/produces}" or "and all the {different kinds/types of} trees that {bear/produce}"

tree fruit {that} yields seed inside it.
"fruit with seeds inside it." or "seed-bearing fruit." See how you translated a similar phrase in verses 11 and 12.

They will be yours for food.
"All of them are yours to eat from." or "You may eat from any/all of those plants."


Gen 1:30 And to every living creature of the earth, and to every bird of the sky, and to every {creature that} moves on the earth that {has} the breath of life in it, {I have given} every green plant for food." And it was so.

And
"In the same way,"

to every creature of the earth,
"to every {kind/type of} {wild/untamed} creature/animal {that lives} on the earth/land," or "to all the {wild/untamed} creatures/animals {that live} on the earth/land," or "all the wild animals," See how you translated a similar phrase in verses 24 and 25.

and to every bird of the sky,
"and every {kind/type of} bird {that flies} in the sky," or "and all the birds {that fly} in the sky,"

and to every {creature that} moves on the earth that {has} living breath in it,
"and every {other} {kind/type of} {creature/animal} that moves/lives on the earth/land and has the breath of life," or "and all the {other} creatures/animals that move/live on the earth/land and breathe {air} to live," See how you translated "that moves on the earth" in verse 28.

{I have given} every green plant for food."
"{I give} every {kind/type of} green plant for/as food." or "{I have given/provided} all the green plants for/as food." For some languages it is clearer or more natural to put this phrase near the beginning of this verse and say, "In the same way, {I give} every {type of} green plant for food to all the {wild} animals {that live} on the earth, and all the birds {that fly} in the sky, and all the {other} animals {that live} on the land and breathe {air}." Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated "plant" in verses 11, 12, 29. (See: figs-infostructure)

And it was so.
"And that is how it was." or "And it/everything was {exactly} as he/God said {it should/would be}." Consider again how you translated this sentence in verses 7, 9, 11, 15, 24 and 30. It may be necessary to translate it differently, depending on the context. For example, here in verse 30 this phrase follows a statement God made, which is different from the other contexts where it follows a command.

Gen 1:31 Then God saw all that he had made, and behold, it was very good. Then there was evening, and there was morning, the sixth day. 

Then God saw
"Then God observed/considered" or "Then God looked at". See how you translated "God saw the light" in verse 4.

all that he had made,
"everything that he had made/created," This refers to everything that God made during the entire week of Creation, not just on the sixth day. Consider again how you translated "made" (or "make") in verses 7, 16, 25, 26 and 31. Compare that to how you translated a word that has a similar meaning ("created") in verses 1, 21 and 27.

and behold,
"and indeed" or "and he saw/observed that". This word calls attention to what God is looking at and helps emphasize that what he saw was very good.

it was very good.
"it was {all} very good/excellent." Consider again how you translated "good/excellent" in verses 4, 10, 12, 18, 21, 25 and 31.

Then there was evening, and there was morning,
"Then evening came and {then/later} morning came," Consider again how you translated these phrases in verses 5, 8, 13, 19, 23 and 31, and see the note about that at verse 5.

Gen 2:1 So the heavens and the earth were completed, and all their hosts. 
   
So the heavens and the earth were completed,
"So {it was that} the heavens and the earth were completed/finished {by God}," or "That is how {God} finished {creating/making} the heavens and the earth," Verse one is a summary statement that looks back at what God did in chapter one. Make sure that is clear in your language. Also consider whether it is better in your language to use an active or passive clause here, and see how you translated "heavens and earth" in Gen 1:1. (See: figs-activepassive)

and all their hosts.
"including all the many things that are in them." or "along with everything in them." This phrase refers to everything in the heavens and on the earth that God had created, as described in chapter one.


Gen 2:2 And by the seventh day God had completed his work that he had done, so he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done.

And by the seventh day
"By the seventh day" or "By day seven". Make sure it is clear in your translation that God had completed his work by the seventh day and did not work on that day. Also consider again how you translated ordinal numbers in Gen 1:5, 8, 13, 19, 23, 31; 2:2. (See: translate-ordinal)

God had completed
"God/he had completed/finished" or "God/he was finished with". Decide whether it is better in your language to refer to God with a title ("God") or a pronoun ("he") in this context. (See: writing-pronouns)

his work that he had done,
"his/the work he had been doing,"	

so he rested on the seventh day from all 
"so he rested/ceased on that day from all" or "so on the seventh day he no longer did". God "rested" in the sense that he stopped his work and did not work on that day. It does not mean he was tired or had lost his strength. Rest is an important theme in the Bible, so you should try to be consistent in how you translate this term here and in other passages such as Exodus 23:12, 31:17 and Hebrews 4:4, 10. Part of this theme includes the Hebrew word for "Sabbath" which has the same root word as the verb for "rest" and is often translated "resting day".

his work that he had done.
"the work that he had been doing." or "that work."


Gen 2:3 And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because on it he rested from all his work of creating that God had done. 

And God
"Then God/he" or "God/He". For some languages it is more natural to begin verse 3 without a conjunction. Other languages use a conjunction here like Hebrew does. Do what is natural in your language." (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)

blessed the seventh day 
"established/designated the seventh day {as a day} to bless {people}" or "honored the seventh day"

and sanctified it,
"and made it a holy/sacred day," or "and set it apart as a day especially devoted/dedicated to him," or "by setting it apart as a special day/time {for people/them} {to rest and worship him}," (See: translate-key-terms)

because on it
"because on/during that day" or "{He did that} because on/during that day". Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

he rested from all his work 
"he ceased from all his/the work" or "he did not do any more work" or "he no longer did the work". See how you translated a similar clause in verse 2.

"of creating that he had been doing." or "that he had been doing, creating {everything}." (See: writing-pronouns)

2:4-24 Adam And Eve And The Garden Of Eden

Gen 2:4 These {are} the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day when Yahweh God made the earth and the heavens,

These {are} 
"These {are more details about}" or "This {is more about}" or "What follows {gives/tells more details about}". This phrase refers forward to Gen 2:5-24 and begins a new section. Chapter one of Genesis gives an overview of what God did each day of creation week, including that he created human beings on day six. Chapter two gives more details about how God created Adam and Eve, who were his most important creations. Each chapter emphasizes different parts of the same history; they are not two different histories. Make sure that is clear in your translation.

the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created,
"the history of the heavens and the earth when they were created {by God}," or "what happened when {God} created the heavens and the earth." or "the history of what {God} did when he created the heavens and the earth:" The Hebrew text uses a passive construction here to emphasize the heavens and the earth. Decide the best way to do that in your language. (See: figs-activepassive)

in the day when
"during the days/time when" or "During the days/time when". Consider whether or not it is clearer or more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here that continues into verse 5.

Yahweh God
"Yahweh {who is} God" or "God {whose name is} Yahweh". This phrase is a combination of God's personal name "Yahweh" with his title "God". Both are used together when he is especially in focus. This pattern of using a personal name and a title together is also used for people in the Old Testament when they are being emphasized, for example, "Ahab king of Israel" and "Ruth the Moabite". Many translations have "LORD God" in place of "Yahweh God" throughout the Old Testament. This follows the Jewish custom of substituting the Hebrew title "Adonai" (which means "my Lord") for "Yahweh" (which means "he is") when they read the Scriptures aloud. More recently, translation teams are putting "Yahweh" back in the Bible text (especially in the Old Testament, but also in the New Testament), and they include a footnote to explain the term. (Some translation teams consider using "Jehovah" instead of "Yahweh". However that is not a name from the Bible, but is formed by taking the consonants from "Yahweh" and combining them with the vowels from "Adonai".) (See: translate-key-terms)

made the earth and the heavens,
"made/created the earth and the heavens". This clause forms a chiasm with "the heavens and the earth...created" in the first part of this verse. Try to keep the same phrase order in your translation. See how you translated "the heavens" and "the earth" in Gen 1:1 and 2:1. (See: figs-chiasm)


Gen 2:5 and every shrub of the field had not yet appeared on the earth, and every plant of the field had not yet sprung up, because Yahweh God had not caused it to rain on the earth, and there was no man to work the ground.

and
"And/Now {for a while,}" or "{For a while,}" or "{for a while,}" Consider whether it is better in your translation to begin a new sentence here or continue the sentence from the end of verse 4. Verses 5-6 give background information about what things were like before God created mankind (verse 7). Some languages use a conjunction like "Now" to introduce background information, while other languages do not use a conjunction. Do what is best in your language. (See: grammar-connect-time-background)

every shrub of the field had not yet appeared on the earth,
"there were not yet any shrubs/bushes {growing} in the fields on the earth," or "no wild shrubs/bushes had started growing on the earth yet,"
   
and every plant of the field had not yet sprung up,
"nor had any {other} plants started growing yet," or "and there were not any {other} plants that had sprouted yet," See how you translated "plants" in Gen 1:11-12, 29-30.

because Yahweh God
"because Yahweh/he" or "{That was} because God". The Hebrew text repeats "Yahweh God" frequently in chapter 2 (starting in verse 4) to emphasize God. For some languages, it is not natural to repeat "Yahweh God" so often in the same paragraph, and it could even give the wrong meaning that there was more than one Yahweh God. For languages like that, it may be best to use "Yahweh God" only once at the beginning of a section or paragraph, then use "Yahweh", "God", or "he" in the rest of the section, depending on the context. Consider what is the most accurate and natural way to refer to Yahweh God at each point in your translation. (See: writing-pronouns)

had not caused it to rain on the earth,
"had not {yet} caused it to rain on the earth," or "had not {yet} sent/caused rain to water the earth," See how you translated "earth" in Gen 1:1 and 2:1.

and there was no man 
"and there were no human beings {yet}" or "and mankind/humans did not exist {yet}"

to work the ground.
"to cultivate/farm the land/soil." Working the ground includes tasks such as clearing the ground, preparing the soil, planting seeds, and watering the plants. See how you translated "ground" in Gen 1:25. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.


Gen 2:6 But mist came up from the earth and watered all of the surface of the ground.

But mist
"But {during/at that time} mist/water/groundwater" or "{During/At that time} mist/springs". The Hebrew word for "mist" refers to water in some form, such as water vapor, springs, or streams of water. Also, some translations begin verse 6 without "But". Do what is best in your language. (See: grammar-connect-phrases-words)

came up
"seeped up" or "kept coming/seeping up" or "would come/seep up". This verb describes a repeated or continuous action.

from the earth
"from the ground" or "from underground"

and watered
"and irrigated" or "and spread over" or "supplied water to"

all of the surface of the ground.
"the entire/whole surface of the land/earth." or "the ground everywhere."


Gen 2:7 Then Yahweh God formed the man {out of} dust from the ground, and he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.

Then Yahweh God
"Then Yahweh {who is} God". The phrase "Yahweh God" is used here to emphasize that he is the one who created mankind. So it is best to keep that here in your translation, unless that would communicate wrong meaning. See how you translated this phrase in Gen 2:4-5. 

formed
"shaped" or "crafted". This word describes what an expert craftsmen would do, and implies artistic skills and design.

the man
 "a man" or "the {first} man". The definite article "the" is used here because this refers to a specific man, the first male human. For many languages it is more natural to use an indefinite article ("a") to introduce him here, or to not use an article at all. Do what is best in your language.

{out of} dust
"{out of} dirt/mud/clay". The word used here in the Hebrew text is usually translated "dust" (as in Gen 13:16, 28:14), but it can also be translated "dirt" (as in Gen 26:15) or "mortar/mud/clay" (as in Leviticus 14:42). The dirt would have been damp enough to be formed or shaped.

from the ground,
"from the earth," See how you translated "ground" in Gen 1:25 and 2:5-6. You may need to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.

and he breathed
"and he/Yahweh blew/exhaled" or "Then he/Yahweh blew/exhaled". For some languages, it is more natural to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language.

into his nostrils the breath of life,
"into the man's nostrils/nose the/his breath that would make him live," or "his breath into the man's nostrils/nose to make him live," This refers to God's breath. As you translate the pronouns "he" and "his" in this verse, make sure it is clear in your language who is being referred to. (See: writing-pronouns) 

and the man
"so that he" or "and then the man". Consider what is the most natural way in your language to refer to the man throughout verse 7. (See: writing-pronouns)

became a living being.
"became a living person." or "became alive." or "came to life." or "started to live."

Gen 2:8 Now Yahweh God had planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and there he put the man whom he had formed.

Now Yahweh God had planted
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean (1) "Now Yahweh God had {previously/already} planted" or "{Before that,} Yahweh God had planted". This interpretation fits the context of chapter one, which says that God had made all the trees and plants on day three (Gen 1:11-12), three days before he created man (Gen 1:26-27; 2:7). Following this view, verses 8-14 give background information for what happens in verses 15-24. (2) "Then Yahweh God planted". According to this interpretation, God made the Garden of Eden on day six after he created man. (See: writing-background)

a garden
"a {large} garden" or "a {large} farm/park". The man lived in this garden and there were animals and many trees and other plants in it too, so it was fairly large. Make sure your translation of this term does not refer to something that is too small.
   
in Eden, in the east,
"in {the land/region of/called} Eden, {which was} in/to the east," or "in the eastern part of {the land/region of/called} Eden," In this context, "in the east" can refer to (1) the eastern part of the region of Eden (2) a region east of where Moses lived when he wrote this. It is best, if possible, to keep your translation of this phrase general here (like the Hebrew text).

and there he put the man
"and that is where he put the man" or "and in that garden he put the man" or "That is where he put the man". Consider whether it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

whom he had formed.
"whom he had shaped/crafted." or "whom he had created/made." See how you translated "formed" in verse 7.


Gen 2:9 And Yahweh God had made to grow from the ground every tree {that} is pleasant to the sight and good for food, and the tree of life in the middle of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

And Yahweh God
"{There} Yahweh/he". See how you translated "Yahweh God" in verse 5, and see the note about that there. (See: writing-pronouns)

had made to grow from the ground every tree {that} is pleasant
"had made/caused to grow from the ground every {kind/type of} tree that is pleasant/beautiful/delightful" or "had made/caused all {kinds/types of} trees to grow from the ground that are pleasant/beautiful". See how you translated "every tree" in Gen 1:29.
   	
to the sight
"to the eyes" or "to look at" or "in appearance"

and good 
"and {that produce/have/grow fruit that is} good" or "and {whose fruit is} good

for food,
"for eating," or "to eat,"

and the tree of life in the middle of the garden,
"including the tree whose fruit gives people {eternal} life, {which was} in the middle of the garden," or "In the middle of the garden was the tree whose fruit makes people live {forever}," Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

and the tree 
"along with the tree" or "as well as the tree" 

of the knowledge of good and evil.
"whose fruit enables people to know/discern {what is} good/right and {what is} evil/wrong." The word "good" refers here to all that is morally right and pleasing to God, and "evil" refers to what is morally wrong and against his will. Keep that in mind as you translate these terms. (See: translate-key-terms)

Gen 2:10 And a river was going out from Eden to water the garden, and from there it divided and became four head{water}s.

And a river was going out 
"Now a river was flowing" or "A river was flowing" or "There was a river flowing". Verse 10 gives more background information that began in verse 8. Many translations omit the conjunction "And" or "Now" here. Do what is best in your language. (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)

from Eden
"from/through {the land/region of} Eden". The garden was inside the land of Eden, so as the river flowed through Eden, it watered the garden.

to water
"to irrigate" or "to provide water for" or "that watered/irrigated" or "that provided water for". See how you translated "watered" in verse 6.

the garden,
"the farm/park," See how you translated this phrase in verse 8.

and from there
"and from the garden" or "From there/Eden". For some languages it is better to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language.

it divided and became four head{water}s.
Verse 10 is ambiguous in the Hebrew text. It could mean (1) "the/that river divided into four {smaller} waters/rivers." This interpretation means that the river in Eden was the source river that watered the garden and then divided downstream into the four smaller rivers. (2) "there were four {smaller} source rivers that joined together and formed the larger river." This interpretation means that the four rivers were source headwaters that flowed downstream and joined to form the larger river in Eden. If possible, leave your translation ambiguous here (like the Hebrew text does), so that either interpretation is possible.


Gen 2:11 The name of the first {is} Pishon. It winds through all of the land of Havilah, where gold {is}.

The name of the first {is}
"The name of the first {river} {is/was}" or "The first {river} is/was named/called" or "The first {river} is/was". Most translations use past tense in verse 10, but then use present tense throughout verses 11-14. It may be best to use past tense throughout verses 10-14, especially since the rivers and places that are named in these verses no longer existed when Genesis was written, because the Flood completely changed the entire surface of the earth; after the Flood, the names of some of those rivers and places were given to new rivers and places.

Pishon.
"the Pishon {River}." Consider whether or not it is natural in your language to use the article ("the") with the name of a river. (See: translate-names)

It winds through
"It meanders/meandered through" or "which flows/flowed around through". The word "winds" or "meanders" means that the river changed direction from time to time. Consider whether it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here, or to continue the previous sentence.

all of the land of Havilah,
"the entire/whole region of/called Havilah," Be consistent in how you translate "land of" throughout this section. (See: translate-names)

where gold {is}.
"{a place} where {there is/was} {much} gold." or "which has/had {a lot of} gold."


Gen 2:12 And the gold of that land {is} good. Bdellium and onyx stone {are} there.

And the gold of that land
"In fact, the gold from that land/region" or "Indeed, the gold {that is found} in that land/region". This sentence emphasizes the previous statement about the gold, and gives more information about it.

{is} good.
"{is/was} {very} pure." or "{is/was} {very} high quality."

Bdellium 
"{A kind/type of fragrant/sweet-smelling resin called} bdellium" or "A {kind/type of} fragrant/sweet-smelling resin/perfume". The meaning of this Hebrew word is not certain. In many translations it is transliterated, that is, spelled the way the Hebrew word is pronounced. It may refer to (1) a fragrant/sweet-smelling tree resin that was used to make perfume; (2) a type of stone or crystal, or possibly pearl. (See: translate-unknown)

and onyx stone
"and {valuable} onyx gemstones" or "and {valuable} stones/gemstones called onyx" or "and {valuable} gemstones". It is not certain what kind of stone this was, but most Bible scholars think it was onyx, which is a kind of quartz that is often black, but also occurs in many other colors, and can have stripes or bands of white (or other colors) running through it. (See: translate-unknown)

{are} there.
"{are/were} {also} {found} there." or "{are/were} {also} in that land/region." Make sure the verb tense you choose here fits with the way you translated verse 11.


Gen 2:13 And the name of the second river {is} Gihon. It winds through all of the land of Cush.

And the name of the second river {is}
"The name of the second river {is/was}" or "The second river is/was named/called" or "The second river is/was" . See how you translated a similar phrase in verse 11.

Gihon.
"the Gihon {River}."

It winds through
"It meanders/meandered through" or "which flows/flowed around through". Consider whether it is better here in your language to begin a new sentence or to continue the previous sentence. See how you translated this phrase in verse 11. 

all of the land of Cush.
"the entire/whole region of/called Cush." See how you translated a similar phrase in verse 11.


Gen 2:14 And the name of the third river {is} Tigris. It goes east of Asshur. And the fourth river {is} Euphrates.

And the name of the third river {is}
"The name of the third river {is/was}" or "The third river is/was named/called" or "The third river is/was"

Tigris.
"the Tigris {River}."
 
It goes east of
"It flows/flowed {in an area} east of" or "which flows/flowed {in an area} east of " or "which was located east of". The word "east" refers to where the river was located, not the direction it was flowing. 

Asshur.
"{the land/region of/called} Asshur/Assyria." This Hebrew name is pronounced "ash-shur" and is spelled "Asshur", "Ashur", or "Assyria" in English, depending on the context. This was a region of land, because at that time there were no cities. Most translations have "Assyria" here. Consider again how you translated "the land of" in verses 11 and 13. (See: translate-names)

And the fourth river {is}
"{The name of} the fourth river {is/was}" or "The fourth river {is/was named/called}" or "and the fourth river {is/was}". See how you translated a similar phrase in verses 11, 13-14. Also consider again whether it is best in your language to use present tense or past tense in verses 10-14.

Euphrates.
"the Euphrates {River}." Consider again how you translated the names of rivers in verses 11, 13-14.

Gen 2:15 And Yahweh God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and tend it.

And Yahweh God took the man and put him 
"Now Yahweh God had {already} put the man" or "After Yahweh God put the man". In verse 8 it says that God had already put the man in the garden, so the way you translate verse 15 should not sound like he did it again. This information is repeated here to continue the story from verse 8. (See: writing-background)

in the Garden of Eden
"in the garden in {the land/region of/called} Eden" or "in Eden Garden". Notice that "Garden" is capitalized when it is part of a name. (See: translate-names)

to work it 
"to cultivate/farm it" or "so that he would cultivate/farm it". See how you translated "work" in verse 5.

and tend it.
"and maintain it." or "and take care of it."


Gen 2:16 Then Yahweh God commanded the man, saying, "From every tree of the garden you may freely eat,

Then Yahweh God
 "Then Yahweh/he" or "he". Consider whether it is better in your language here to begin a new sentence or to continue the sentence from verse 15. Also consider what is the best way to refer to "Yahweh God" here. (See: writing-pronouns)

commanded the man, saying,
"commanded the man," or "commanded him," Consider what is the best way to translate this quote margin in your language. (See: writing-quotations)

"From every tree of the garden you may freely eat,
"You may eat as much {fruit} as you want {to eat} from every/any tree in the garden," or "You are permitted to eat whatever fruit that you want {to eat} from every/any tree in the garden," 


Gen 2:17 but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, because on the day you eat from it you will surely die."

but you must not eat
"except you must not eat" or "except for one: you must not eat" or "Except I forbid you to eat". Make sure it is clear in your translation that God is not contradicting himself here, but rather he is giving an exception to what he said in verse 16. Also consider whether it is better here in your language to continue the sentence from verse 16 or to begin a new sentence. (See: grammar-connect-exceptions)

from the tree
"{any fruit} from the tree" or "{the fruit that grows} on the tree"

of the knowledge of good and evil,
 "whose fruit enables people to know/discern {what is} good/right and {what is} evil/wrong," See how you translated this phrase in verse 9.

because on the day you eat from it
"because on the {same} day you eat {fruit} from that tree" or "because if you eat {any fruit} from that tree, on that {same} day" or "because as soon as you eat {fruit} from that tree"

you will surely die."
"you will certainly/definitely die."

"a helper/companion who is {just/exactly} right for him." or "someone who is suitable/right for him and will help him." or "a suitable companion to help him."


Gen 2:19 And Yahweh God had formed from the ground every living creature of the field and every bird of the sky. So he brought them to the man to see what he would call them, and whatever the man called a living creature, that {was} its name.
 
And 
"Now {previously,}" or "Now {before that,}" or "{Before that,}" The first sentence of verse 19 is a flashback of what happened before the events in verses 15-18 (which were first recorded in Gen 1:20-21, 24-25). Consider the best way to begin this sentence in your language. (See: grammar-connect-time-background)

Yahweh God
"Yahweh" or "he". Consider whether it is better in your language to use a noun phrase ("Yahweh God" or "Yahweh") or a pronoun ("he") here. (See: writing-pronouns)

had formed from the ground
"had formed/shaped {out of some dust/dirt} from the ground" or "had used {dust/dirt} from the ground to form/shape". Translate this phrase in a way that makes it clear that this is background information that had already happened. Also see how you translated "formed" in verses 7-8 and "dust from the ground" in verse 7. (See: writing-background)

every living creature of the field
"every {kind/type of} creature/animal that lives in the fields/wild" or "all {the different kinds/types of} animals that live in the fields" or "all {the different kinds/types of} wild animals". Consider how you translated a similar phrase ("every living creature of the earth") in Gen 1:24, 30.

and every bird of the sky.
"and every {kind/type of} bird {that flies} in the sky." or "and all {the different kinds/types of} birds {that fly} in the sky." See how you translated this phrase in Gen 1:30.

So he brought them 
"So/Then he brought/took them {all}". This sentence continues the storyline. Consider how your language continues a story after giving background information. Also consider whether "brought" or "took" fits best here in your language. (See: figs-go)

to the man
"to Adam". Every translation team needs to decide when to use Adam's name for the first time in the book of Genesis. The Hebrew word "adam" means "man" and is also Adam's name; the choice that is not followed here in your translation could be put in a footnote. Some translations first use Adam's name here in verse 19, when he is naming the animals. Many translations start using his name at the end of verse 20. Still other translations wait until 3:20 when he names Eve, and a few other translations begin in 3:9, 17 or 21. (See: translate-names)

 to see
"to watch/hear" or "to find out"

what he would call them,
"what he would name each one," or "what names he would give/assign to them," These names were labels for what kind of animals they were, such as "dog" or "horse", not personal names like "David" or "Mary".

Gen 2:21 So Yahweh God caused a deep sleep to fall on the man. And {while} he was sleeping, then he took one of his ribs and closed up its place {with} flesh.

So Yahweh God caused a deep sleep to fall on the man.
"So/Then Yahweh God caused the man to fall/go into a deep/sound sleep." or "So/Then Yahweh God caused the man to sleep {very} deeply/soundly." Many languages have a similar idiom for "caused a deep sleep to fall on" that works well here. Consider what is best in your language. (See: figs-idiom)

And {while} he was sleeping,
"Then {while} the man was sleeping/asleep," Consider whether it is best in your language to use a pronoun or a noun here to refer to the man. (See: writing-pronouns)

then he took 
"he/God took {out}". Consider whether to use a pronoun or noun here to refer to God. Make sure it is clear in your translation who is being referred to at each point in this verse. (See: writing-pronouns)

one of his ribs
This phrase is ambiguous in the Hebrew text. It could mean (1) "one of the man's ribs {from his body/side}" or "a rib {from the man's body/side}" (2} "part of the man's side {from his body}"

and closed up its place {with} flesh.
"and filled in the place/hole where it had been with flesh {and healed it}." or "and replaced it with flesh {and healed him}." In this context, the term "flesh" probably includes muscles and skin. 


Gen 2:22 Then Yahweh God built the rib which he had taken from the man into a woman, and he brought her to the man.

Then Yahweh God
"Next he" or "After that he". For many languages it is more natural here to use a pronoun to refer to Yahweh God. Do what is best in your language. After you finish translating a chapter or section, it is a good practice to read that section aloud and listen for what is the best way to refer to God and others at each place in the text. (See: writing-pronouns)

built the rib which he had taken from the man into a woman,
"made/constructed a woman from the rib which he had taken out of the man{'s body}," or "used the rib which he taken from the man to make/construct a woman from it," See how you translated "rib" in verse 21 and see the note about that there. 

and he brought her to the man.
"and he took her to the man." or "Then he brought/took her to the man." See how you translated "brought" in verse 19. (See: figs-go)


Gen 2:23 And the man said, "This {one} now {is} bone from my bones and flesh from my flesh! She will be called `woman,' because {it was} from a man {that} she was taken."

And the man said,
"Then the man said/exclaimed," or "{When the man saw her,} he said/exclaimed," or "{When the man woke up and saw the woman,} he said/exclaimed," Remember to only make implied information explicit in your translation if it helps people understand the text better, or if it is necessary to prevent wrong meaning or bad grammar in your language. (See: figs-explicit)

"This {one} now
"Now there is a person who" or "At last here is a person {like me} who" or "Finally/Ahh! Here is someone {like me} who"

{is} bone from my bones and flesh from my flesh! 
"{has} bones and flesh from me!" or "was made out of my own bones and flesh!"

She will be called `woman,'
"I will call her `woman,' " There is a play-on-words here because the Hebrew word for woman ("ishsha") is similar to the Hebrew word for man ("ish"). You could put that information in a footnote.

because {it was} from a man {that} she was taken."
"because she was taken {by God} from {the body of} a man." or "because {it was} from {the body of} a man {that} {God} took her." Consider what is the best way to translate this passive clause in your language. (See: figs-activepassive)


Gen 2:24 For that {reason} a man will leave his father and his mother, and he will cling to his wife, and they will become as one flesh.

a man will leave
"a/every man {who marries} will/must leave" or "{when a man gets married,} he must move away from"

his father and his mother,
"{the home of} his father and mother," 

and he will cling to his wife,
"and he must unite/join with his wife," or "and he must live in close relationship with his wife," This idiom means that the man is committed to his wife and has a close physical relationship with her, too. Consider the best way to translate this in your language. (See: figs-idiom)

and they 
"so that they". Some languages have a special dual pronoun for "they" that fits well here. (See: figs-youdual)

will become one flesh.
"become completely one/united." or "they will become united in body {and spirit}." or "will become united like one person." The phrase "one flesh" is an idiom that emphasizes the close physical and spiritual unity between a husband and wife. Other languages may have a similar idiom. Consider how to best communicate this in your language. (See: figs-idiom)

2:25-3:24 The First Sin And God's Judgment

Gen 2:25 And the man and his wife were both naked, but they were not ashamed.

And the man and his wife were both naked,

Now the serpent
"Now the snake". The conjunction "Now" introduces background information about the serpent. See how you translated this conjunction in Gen 2:5, 8, 19. (See: grammar-connect - time-background)

was more crafty than all the living creature{s} of the field{s}
"was more {deceptive and} clever/cunning than any of the {other} creatures/animals that live in the fields/wild" or "was the craftiest of all the animals". Make sure that your translation of "crafty" means that the snake had evil intent and was clever in a way that was not good. See how you translated "living creature of the field" in Gen 2:19-20.

that Yahweh God had made.
"that Yahweh {who is} God had made/created." or "that God {whose name is Yahweh) had made/created." Make sure your translation of this phrase refers to the animals that God had made, not the fields. Also see how you translated "Yahweh God" in chapter 2, beginning in verse 4.

And he 
"{One day} he" or "{One day} the serpent/snake". If you use a pronoun ("he") here in your translation, make sure it refers to the serpent, not God. (See: writing-pronouns)

"asked the woman," or "{came/went to the woman and} asked her," The snake asked a question, so some languages have to be more specific and say "asked" in the quote margin. Do what is best in your language. (See: writing-quotations)

"Did God really say, `You must not eat

"We may eat 
"{No,} {he/God said that} we may/can eat" or "{No,} we have permission {from God/him} to eat" or "{No,} God/he has given us permission to eat". The woman is not including the snake when she says "we" here. (See: figs-exclusive)

"you eat {fruit} from that tree," or "you eat some of that fruit," The pronouns "you" and "your" are plural in this verse and refer to the man and the woman. Some languages have a special dual pronoun for this. Consider again how you translated "you" and "your" in verses 1-5. (See: figs-dual)

then your eyes will be opened,
"your mind/understanding will be opened/expanded," or "you will gain/have new understanding," or "you will understand/know new things," Consider whether your language has an idiom like "your eyes will be opened" that would fit well here. (See: figs-idiom)

and 
"and {as a result}" or "so that". The following clause is the result of their eyes being opened. Consider the best way to communicate that in your translation. (See: figs-grammar-connect-logic-result)

you will be like God in knowing good and evil."
"you will be like God/him because you will know {what is} good/right and {what is} evil/wrong." or "you will know {what is} good/right and {what is} evil/wrong just like God does." The Hebrew word "Elohim" in this clause is ambiguous. It can mean (1) "God", as it does everywhere else in the first 30 chapters of Genesis; (2) "gods" or "divine beings"; (3) "angels". See how you translated "good and evil" in Gen 2:9, 17.


Gen 3:6 And the woman saw that the tree {was} good for food, and that it {was} pleasant to the eyes, and {that} the tree was desirable for gaining wisdom. So she took some of its fruit and ate {it}. Then she also gave {some} to her husband with her, and he ate {it}. 

And the woman saw that 
"The woman saw/observed that"

the tree
"the tree {produced fruit that}" or "{the fruit of} that tree" or "the tree{'s fruit}". The word "tree" refers here to the fruit that is produced by that tree. Make sure that is clear in your translation. (See: figs-synecdoche)

{was} good for food,
"{was/looked} good/delicious to eat" 

and that it {was} pleasant to the eyes,
"and that the tree {itself} was/looked {very} beautiful,"

and {that} the tree was desirable for gaining wisdom. 
"and {she thought/believed} that {the fruit from} the tree would make her wise/wiser." or "She {also} desired/wanted {to eat} the fruit so that it would make her wise/wiser." Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

So she took some of its fruit and ate {it}.
"So/Then she took/picked some of the fruit {from/off the tree} and ate {it}." 

Then she also gave {some} 
"She also gave {some of the fruit}"

to her husband with her,
"to her husband, {who was} {there} with her,"

and he ate {it}.
"and he ate {it/some} {too}." or "and he {also} ate {it/some}."


Gen 3:7 Then the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they {were} naked. So they sewed fig leaves together and made aprons for themselves.

Then
"Immediately/Suddenly". An immediate result of their sin was that they realized they were naked, which they had not been aware of before.

the eyes of them both were opened,
"it was as if their eyes/minds were opened/enlightened," or "they both gained/had new understanding," or "they both understood new things," See how you translated the idiom "eyes...opened" in verse 5. (See: figs-idiom)

and they knew
"so that they realized" or "so that they became aware"

that they {were} naked.
"that their bodies {were} naked/uncovered {and felt ashamed/embarrassed}."

So they sewed
"So they fastened/joined {together}". The word for "sewed" implies here that some type of needle and thread were used. For example, they may have used a thin, sharpened stick for the needle, and plant fibers for the thread. If necessary, you could use a more general term such as "fastened/joined together" or "connected". Also, some languages have dual pronouns that can be used in verses 7-8 for "they" and "themselves". Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-youdual)

fig leaves 
"{some} fig {tree} leaves" or "{some} {large} leaves from a fig tree". Historical facts should not be changed in a translation, including the historical fact that Adam and Eve used fig tree leaves to make aprons. If fig trees are not known in your language area, you could say "{large} leaves from a tree called fig {tree}". (See: translate-unknown)

and made aprons for themselves.
"and used/wore them like/as aprons/skirts/loincloths {to cover their nakedness/bodies}." or "and wore them around their waists {to cover their nakedness/bodies}." or "and used them to make clothes for themselves." These aprons/skirts probably covered them from the waist down to somewhere around the knees.

Gen 3:8 Then they heard the sound of Yahweh God walking in the garden in the breeze of the day, but the man and his wife hid from the presence of Yahweh God among the trees of the garden. 

Then they heard
"Then/Later the man and his wife heard". For some languages it may be clearer and more natural to put the noun phrase "the man and his wife" here and then use a pronoun ("they") later in this sentence. Do what is best in your language. (See: writing-pronouns)

the sound of Yahweh God walking 
"the sound of Yahweh God{'s footsteps} as he walked" or "Yahweh God's voice as he walked". This phrase can refer to the sound of God's footsteps or to the sound of his voice. Either meaning fits the context well and is followed by many translations.

in the garden 
"{around} in the garden" or "through the garden"

in the breeze of the day,
"{late in the afternoon} in/during the breezy/cool {time} of the day," or "{late that afternoon/day} when there was a cool breeze blowing," This idiom refers to the late afternoon or early evening when there is a breeze blowing and it is cooler. For some languages it is more natural to put this time phrase at the beginning of the sentence. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-idiom)

but the man and his wife
"but/so they". If you use "the man and his wife" earlier in this verse in your translation, consider whether a pronoun should be used here. (See: writing-pronouns)

hid
"hid {themselves}" or "{tried to} hide {themselves}"

from the presence of Yahweh God
"from Yahweh God" or "from his presence/sight" or "from him". Consider what is the best way to refer to Yahweh here in your language. (See: writing-pronouns)

among the trees
"in the midst of the trees" or "behind some trees"

of the garden.
"in the garden." or "there." Since the garden is already mentioned earlier in verse 8, it may be more natural to be general here and say "there". Do what is best in your language.


Gen 3:9 So Yahweh God called to the man and said to him, "Where {are} you?" 

So Yahweh God 
"Then/But Yahweh God". See how you translated this name for God in verses 1 and 8.

called to the man and said to him,
"called {out} to the man and asked him," or "called {out} to Adam," See the note at Gen 2:19 about when to start using Adam's name. Also consider the best way to translate this quote margin in your language. (See: writing-quotations)

"Where {are} you?"
"{Adam,} where are you?" Notice that the word "you" is singular here because God is only addressing the man. (See: figs-yousingular) 


Gen 3:10 And he said, "I heard your sound in the garden, but I was afraid because I {was} naked, so I hid." 

And he said,
"He/Adam answered {him}," or "The man replied," (See: writing-quotations)

"I heard your sound 
"I heard the sound of you {walking}" or "I heard your voice" or "I heard the sound of your footsteps/voice {as you walked}". See how you translated "sound" in verse 8.

in the garden,
"through the garden,"

but I was afraid because I {was} naked, so I hid."
"but I was naked, so I was/felt afraid and I hid {from you}." or "but I was naked and afraid {that you would see me}, so I hid."


Gen 3:11 Then he said, "Who told you that you {were} naked? Did you eat from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?" 

Then he said,
"So Yahweh God asked {him}," Make sure your translation of "he" refers to Yahweh here, not the man. (See: writing-pronouns)

"Who told you that you were naked?
 "What made you realize/know that you were naked?" or "How did you find out that you were naked?" The pronoun "you" is still singular here. (See: figs-yousingular)

Did you eat from the tree
Did you {disobey me and} eat {fruit} from the tree"

that I commanded you not to eat from?"
"that I commanded you, `Do not eat from it'?" For some languages it is more natural to use a direct quote here for Yahweh's words. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-quotesinquotes)


Gen 3:12 Then the man said, "The woman whom you gave {to be} with me, she gave me {fruit} from the tree, and I ate {it}."

Then the man said,
"But the man said/replied {to him}," or "The man answered {him},"

"The woman whom you gave {to be} with me, she 
"The woman whom you put here {to be/live} with me, she {is the one who}" or "It was the woman you gave to me who". The pronoun "she" is emphatic in the Hebrew text. That, along with the position of "The woman" at the beginning of the sentence, shows that the man is strongly emphasizing his blame on the woman. Translate this clause in your language in a way that will show that emphasis. 

gave me {fruit} from the tree,
"gave me {some fruit} from that tree," or "gave me some of the/that fruit," See how you translated "fruit" in verses 1-6.

and I ate {it}."
"so I ate {it}." or "That is why I ate {it/some}." Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.


Gen 3:13 Then Yahweh God said to the woman, "What {is} this you have done?" But the woman said, "The serpent deceived me, so I ate {it}."

Then Yahweh God said to the woman,
"So Yahweh God asked the woman," Consider what is the best way to translate this quote margin in your language. (See: writing-quotations)

"What {is} this you have done?"
"What have you done?" or "What did you do?" or "Tell me what you have done." God already knew the answer to this question, but he is giving the woman a chance to confess and explain what she did. God's question probably also implies that he is displeased with what has happened.

And the woman said,
"But the woman said/replied {to him}," or "The woman said/replied," or "She replied," (See: writing-quotations)

"The serpent
"The snake" or "It was the serpent/snake that". This phrase is emphasized in the Hebrew text.

Gen 3:14 Then Yahweh God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, you are cursed above all the livestock and above all the living creature{s} of the field{s}. You will move on your belly, and you will eat dust all the days of your life.

Then Yahweh God said to the serpent,
"So Yahweh God said to the snake,"

"Because you have done this,
"Because/Since you did that," or "Because/Since you deceived/tricked the woman," 

you are cursed
"you are cursed {by me}" or "I am cursing you" or "I will cause you to suffer" or "I will punish you". In this context, "cursed" involves God punishing the serpent and its descendants by causing them to suffer by crawling along the ground on their bellies and having a hostile relationship with human beings. Make sure that the way you translate this term does not imply the use of magic. (See: translate-key-terms)

above 
"more {severely/harshly} than". When Adam and Eve sinned and God judged them, the curse and punishment of death and decay also affected everything that was under their authority, including the animals. Here in Gen 3:14, God puts a more severe curse on the serpent (and his descendants) than he put on the rest of the animals.

all the livestock
"all the domestic/tame animals". See how you translated "livestock" in Gen 1:24-26; 2:20.

and above all the living creature{s} of the field{s}. 
"and more {severely/harshly} than all the animals of/in the fields/wild." or "and more {severely/harshly} than all the wild animals." See how you translated "living creatures of the fields" in verse 1.

You will move on your belly,
"{As a result,} you will/must move/crawl {on/along the ground} on your belly/stomach,"

and you will eat dust 
"and you will/must eat dust/dirt {with your food}". Make sure your translation of this clause does not imply that dust or dirt is all the snake will eat. Rather it could mean that dirt will get into his mouth when he eats his food, or it could be an idiom that refers to the fact that as he slithers along, his mouth will always be close to the dirt on the ground (a position of humility). Also see how you translated "dust" in Gen 2:7.

all the days of your life.
"your entire life." or "for as long as you live."


Gen 3:15 I will also put hostility between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring. He will strike you {on} the head, and you will strike him {on} the heel."

I will also
"Besides that, I will"

put hostility between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring.
"cause you and the woman to be enemies {with each other}, and your offspring/descendants and her offspring/descendants to also be enemies." or "I will cause you and your descendants to be enemies with the woman and her descendants."

He
"{In fact,} her offspring/descendant" or "{In fact,} one of her descendants". The pronoun "He" is ambiguous here. It could refer to (1) the woman's descendant (Jesus) who would one day come to earth as the Messiah/Christ. (2) the woman's descendants who will constantly be enemies of the snake's descendants. If you follow the first interpretation, this would be the first prophecy in the Bible about the Messiah/Christ ("the Anointed One" or "the Promised Savior King") who would come to earth and destroy Satan's power (Hebrews 2:14). You could include that information in a footnote.

will strike you {on} the head, and you will strike him {on} the heel."
"will strike/crush your head, and you will strike/bite/bruise his heel." This is figurative language that Satan will harm the Messiah, but the Messiah will destroy him. For some languages it is better to switch the order of these clauses and say, "{In fact,} you will strike/bite/bruise the heel of one of her descendants, but he will strike/crush your head." Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

Gen 3:16 To the woman he said, "I will greatly multiply your pain and your childbearing; you will bear children in pain. Yet your desire {will be} for your husband, and he will rule over you."

To the woman he said,
"{Then} he/God said to the woman," or "{Then} Yahweh God {turned} to the woman and said {to her}," In the Hebrew text, "to the woman" comes first in this sentence, to emphasize her. Do what is natural in your language. Also consider what is the best way to refer to God here in your language. (See: writing-pronouns)
 
"I will greatly multiply your pain
"I will greatly increase how much you suffer" or "I will cause you to have/experience much/severe pain" or "I will cause it to be very painful"

and your childbearing;
"when you bear children;" or "when you give birth;"

in pain you will bear children. 
"{yes/indeed,} you will suffer much pain when you give birth." or "{yes/indeed,} bearing children will be very painful for you." This clause is the second part of a parallelism, which emphasizes the pain and suffering that women will experience when they bear children. If possible, it is best to keep both parts of the parallelism in your translation. (See: figs-parallelism)

Yet your desire {will be} for your husband, and
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here, because the conjunctions and the idiom "your desire will be for your husband" are all ambiguous in this context. The text can mean (1) "Yet/But you will {still} desire/long {to be with} your husband, and....", which is similar to what "desire" means in Song of Songs 7:10. (2) "Besides that, you will desire/want {to control} your husband, but....", which is similar to what "desire" means in Gen 4:7. The interpretation that is not followed in your translation could be put in a footnote.

he will rule over you."
"he will have authority over you." or "he will control you." or "he will lord it over you." See how you translated "rule over" in Gen 1:18. It may be necessary to translate this term differently here because of the negative context of the curse and the consequences of sin.

Gen 3:17 Then to the man he said, "Since you listened to your wife's voice and ate from the tree that I commanded you by saying, `You must not eat from it,' the ground is cursed because of you. By painful toil you will eat {from} it all the days of your life.

Then to the man he said,
"Then/Next he/God said to the man," or "Then/Next Yahweh God {turned} to Adam and said {to him}," In the Hebrew text, "to the man" is emphasized. See how you translated a similar case ("to the woman") in verse 16. For a note about when to start using Adam's name in your translation see Gen 2:19.

"Since you
"Since/Because you {disobeyed me and}"

listened to the voice of your wife
"did what your wife said/suggested" or "did/followed what your wife told you to do". This phrase means that Adam heard what his wife said to him and then did what she said. Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language. (See: figs-metonymy)

and ate from the tree 
"and ate {fruit} from the tree"

that I commanded you by saying, `You must not eat from it,' 
"that I commanded/told you, "Do not eat {any fruit} from it," or "that I commanded you to not eat {any fruit} from." Consider whether it is better in your language to translate this embedded quote as a direct or indirect quote. Also see how you translated this command in verse 3. (See: figs-quotesinquotes) 

the ground is cursed because of you.
"the ground is cursed {by me} because of what you did." or "I have cursed the ground because you sinned." For some languages it may be clearer or more natural to break up this long sentence and say, "You did what your wife said and ate {fruit} from the tree that I commanded you not to eat {any fruit} from. Because of what you did, I have cursed the ground." Also see how you translated "cursed" in verse 14. (See: figs-infostructure)

By painful toil you will eat {from} it
"{As a result,} {only} by painful toil will you eat {any food} from it" or "{As a result,} you will have to work {very} hard and suffer {to grow/get enough food} to eat" (See: grammar-connect-logic-result)

all the days of your life.
"every day of your life." or "for your entire life." or "for as long as you live." You could put this clause before the previous clause and say, "{As a result,} for as long as you live, you will have to work {very} hard and suffer..." Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 3:18 And it will produce thorn{s} and thistle{s} for you, and you will eat the plant{s} of the field{s}.

And it will produce thorn{s} and thistle{s}
"In fact, the ground will produce/grow thorn {plants} and thistle {plants} {and other weeds}" or "In fact, thornbushes and thistle plants {and other weeds} will grow from the ground". The thorn and thistle plants represent all types of weeds, which are useless, and possibly harmful, plants. (See: figs-synecdoche)

for you, and you will eat the plant{s} of the field{s}.
The Hebrew text here can mean (1) "{and make it difficult} for you to grow {enough} crops in the/your fields for food." or "so that you will have to work very hard in your fields to grow/produce {enough} crops/food to eat." (2) "so that {your crops will not grow well and} you will {have to} eat {wild} plants that grow in the {open} fields {to survive}." That difference of interpretation is caused because the Hebrew word "fields" can refer to land that people cultivate or to uncultivated land where wild plants grow. 


Gen 3:19 By the sweat of your face you will eat bread, until you return to the ground, since from it you were taken. For you {are} dust, and to dust you will return."

By the sweat of your face you will
"You will have to {work hard and} sweat a lot in order to" The phrase "by the sweat of your face/forehead" is an idiom that refers to hard physical labor. Consider whether your languages has a similar idiom. (See: figs-idiom)

eat bread,
"{grow/produce/have} {enough} food to eat," Bread was one of the main food staples for that time and culture, so the Hebrew word for "bread" is used here as an idiom that refer to all food, not just bread. Consider whether your language does something similar, using one type of food (such as bread, rice or potatoes) to refer to all food in general. Or you could use a general term like "food", especially if bread is rare or expensive in your language area. (See: figs-idiom)

until you return to the ground,
"until you {die and} again become dust/dirt," 

since from it you were taken.
"which you were taken/made from {by me}." or "which I took/created you from." or "which I made/created you out of."

For
"Yes/Indeed," or "That's right," This sentence rephrases and emphasizes what God just said. (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)

you {are} dust
"your bodies {were created/made} {by me} from dust/dirt" or "{I created/made} you out of dust/dirt"

and to dust you will return."
"so dust/dirt is what you will become again {after you die}."

"called/named his wife" or "gave his wife the name"

Eve,
"Eve, {which means "living/live,"}" If you include the meaning of Eve's name in your translation or in a footnote, make sure it is similar to the word in the following clause that has the same meaning ("living"), so that it is clear why Eve was given that name. The meaning of names is important in the Hebrew language, and this translation issue occurs frequently in the book of Genesis. (See: translate-names)

"Behold,
"Look/Listen," This word expresses emotion and calls attention to what God says next. See how you translated this term in Gen 1:29.

the man
"the man {and his wife}" or "man{kind}" or "human beings". Throughout verses 22-24 "the man" represents mankind, which included both the man and the woman at this point. Make sure your translation communicates that clearly in those verses and does not just refer to Adam.

has become like one of us
"have become like one of us" or "have become like us". The pronoun "us" is inclusive because God is talking to himself. (See: figs-exclusive)

in knowing good and evil. 
"so that they know {what is} good and {what is} evil." See how you translated this phrase in verse 5, and a similar phrase in Gen 2:9.

And now he must not be allowed to

reach out his hand and also take {fruit} from the tree of life and eat it
"also take/pick and eat fruit from the tree of {eternal} life," or "also eat fruit from the tree that gives people {eternal} life," See how you translated "took/picked fruit" in verse 6, and how you translated "the tree of life" in Gen 2:9.

sent him out of 
"forced them to leave" or "expelled/banished the man {and his wife} from". Notice that in verses 22-24, "the man", "him", and "he" refer to mankind, that is, the man and the woman. Make sure it is clear in your translation here that both of them were sent out of the garden, not just the man. Some languages have dual pronouns that are used for "they" and "them" in verses 22-24. 

the Garden of Eden
"the garden in {the land/region of/called} Eden" or "Eden Garden". See how you translated this phrase in Gen 2:15.

to work the ground

on the east side of the Garden of Eden 
"on/to the east {side} of the garden {at its entrance}" or "{at the entrance} of/to the garden, {which was} on its east side". It is implied that the entrance to the garden is where the cherubim were placed to keep everyone from ever entering the garden again. Consider again how you translated "garden" in Gen 2:8-10, 15-16; 3:1-3, 8, 10, 23-24.

cherubim {angels}
"{some} {powerful} cherubim {angels}" or "{some} {powerful beings called} cherubim {angels}". Most translations transliterate or borrow this term from Hebrew throughout the Bible. Cherubim are a special category of very powerful angels. Each one has four faces: a human face, a lion's face, a bull's face and an eagle's face (Ezekiel 1:10; 10:14). Each of them also has multiple wings. You could include some of that information in a footnote. (See: translate-unknown)

and a flaming sword
"and a blazing/fiery/burning sword" or "and a sword made of flames". A sword is a weapon that has a very long, sharp (often two-sided) blade that is longer than a knife, machete, or dagger and is attached to a hilt or handle. This sword may have had flames coming from it, or this may have been fire in the shape of a sword.

turning in every direction
"that was turning/swinging around in all directions" or "that was swinging/flashing back and forth". It seems that the sword was swinging by itself since there is no mention of anyone holding it.

"became pregnant and {later} gave birth to". Translate this term in a way that will not embarrass people, especially when read aloud.

Cain.
"{a son they named} Cain{, which means "obtained/acquired"}." You could include the meaning of Cain's name in your translation or in a footnote. See what you did for a similar case in Gen 3:20.

And she said,
"because she said/exclaimed," or "{They named him that} because she/Eve had said/exclaimed," This sentence explains how Cain got his name. Make sure that is clear in your translation.

"I have obtained
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) "I have obtained/acquired" (2) "I have produced/created". If you include the meaning of Cain's name earlier in this verse in your translation or in a footnote, make sure it matches your choice here, so that it is clear why he was given that name.

a man
"a male child" or "a boy/son" or "a baby boy". For some languages it is confusing to refer to a newborn baby as a man. Do what is clear and natural in your language.

with Yahweh!"
"with {help from} Yahweh!" or "with Yahweh{'s help}!" For some languages it is more natural to put this phrase earlier in this sentence and say, "With Yahweh's help I have obtained/acquired a son!" or "Yahweh has enabled/helped me to obtain/get a son!" Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 4:2 Then she continued on to bear his brother Abel. Now Abel became a keeper of flock{s}, and Cain became a worker of the ground.

Then she 
"Then she/Eve" or "After that she/Eve". Consider whether it is better in your language to use a pronoun or a noun to refer to Eve here. (See: writing-pronouns)

continued on to bear his brother
"also gave birth to his/Cain's brother" or "gave birth to another baby boy, {who was} his/Cain's brother". The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. Cain and Abel may have been twins, or Abel may have been born sometime later after Eve became pregnant again. If possible, translate verse 2 in a way that allows for either interpretation. Also, if your language has a specific term for "younger brother", you could use it here. (See: translate-kinship)

Abel.
"{whom they named} Abel." or "{whose name was} Abel."

Now Abel 
"Now {when the boys had grown up,} Abel" or "{When they grew up,} Abel". This sentence introduces background information for what happens next. Consider the best way to begin this sentence in your language. Also, It is implied here that the boys had grown up to be adults. If necessary, you could make that explicit in your translation. (See: grammar-connect-time-background)

became a keeper of flock{s},
"became/was a keeper/herder of flocks/sheep," or "became/was a shepherd," or "raised sheep {and goats}," A flock can be a large group of sheep or of goats, or a mixture of both.

and Cain
"whereas/but Cain". Consider the best way in your language to contrast Cain and his work with Abel and his work. (See: grammar-connect-logic-contrast)

became a worker of the ground. 
"became/was a worker/tiller/farmer of the ground/soil." or "became/was a {crop} farmer." or "grew {food} crops." Cain raised crops, not animals. See how you translated a similar phrase ("work the ground") in Gen 2:5.


Gen 4:3 And it happened in the course of days that Cain brought some of the fruit of the ground {as} an offering to Yahweh. 

And it happened in the course of days that
"Then one day it happened that" or "As time went on/by, one day". These phrases introduce an important new event. Consider the best way to do that in your language. (See: writing-newevent)

Cain brought 
"Cain offered/gave"

some of the fruit
"some of the crops" or "some of the edible plants". The word "fruit" is general here and refers to any edible plant or crop that grows as the result of being cultivated. Make sure that is clear in your translation.

of the ground
"{that he had harvested} from his farmland/fields" or "{that he had raised/grown} in his fields" 

{as} an offering to Yahweh.
"to Yahweh as an offering/gift/sacrifice {to honor/worship him}." The term "offering" refers to something that is given. (See: translate-key-terms)


Gen 4:4 And Abel also brought some of the firstborn of his flock{s} and some of their fat. And Yahweh looked {favorably} on Abel and his offering. 

And Abel also brought
"Abel also brought/offered/gave {an offering/gift/sacrifice} {to Yahweh}, {but what he offered/gave was}" or "But Abel offered/gave {to Yahweh}". There is a contrast between Abel and Cain and between their offerings.

the firstborn of his flock{s}
"the firstborn {animals} from his flock{s}/sheep". See how you translated "flocks" in verse 2.

and some of their fat. 
"and/including some of the fat portions of the meat." or "and/including some of their best parts." or "and/including the fattest/best parts of the animals/meat." In that culture, fat was considered one of the best parts of an animal to eat. If that is different from how fat is viewed in your language area, that information could be put in a footnote.

And Yahweh looked {favorably} on
"Yahweh was pleased/happy with" or "Yahweh accepted"

Abel and his offering.
"Abel and his gift/sacrifice." or "Abel and what he offered/gave {to him}."
 

Gen 4:5 But he did not look {favorably} on Cain and his offering. So Cain burned with intense anger, and his face fell. 

But he
"But he/Yahweh" or "However, he/Yahweh" (See: writing-pronouns)

did not look {favorably} on Cain
"was not pleased/happy with Cain" or "did not accept Cain". See how you translated "looked {favorably} on" in verse 4.

and his offering.
"and/or his gift/sacrifice." or "and/or what he offered/gave {to him}."

So Cain burned with intense anger, 
"So Cain was/became/felt extremely angry," Many languages have a similar idiom that fits well here. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-idiom)

and his face fell.
"and his face showed that he was angry/upset." or "and he frowned/scowled." or "and his face showed it." (See: figs-idiom)


Gen 4:6 Then Yahweh said to Cain, "Why are you burning with anger? And why is your face fallen? 

Then Yahweh said to Cain,
"Then Yahweh asked Cain/him," The way you translate this quote margin should fit with the way that you translated the following three rhetorical questions. (See: writing-quotations)

"Why are you burning with anger? And why is your face fallen?
"Why are you so angry? And why are you frowning/scowling?" or "There is no need/reason for you to be angry and frowning/scowling." God is using these rhetorical questions to correct Cain. Consider the best way to communicate that in your language. Also see how you translated the idioms "burned with...anger" and "face fell" in verse 5. (See: figs-rquestion)


Gen 4:7 If you do right, will {you} not {be} accepted? But if you do not do right, sin is crouching at the door, and its desire {is} for you, but you must rule over it."

If you do right,
"If you do {what is} right,"

will {you} not {be} accepted?
"{you know that} you will be accepted {by me}." or "{you know that} I will be pleased with you {and your offering/gift} {too}." or "I will accept you {and your offering/gift} {too}." God uses this rhetorical question here to remind Cain of something that he already knew. Consider the best way to do that in your language. (See: figs-rquestion)

But if you do not do right,
"But if you don't do {what is} right," or "But if you do what is wrong,"

sin is crouching 
"{then} sin {is like a fierce/dangerous animal that} is crouching/waiting" or "{then} sin will be crouching/waiting {like a fierce/wild animal}". In verse 7 sin is personified, that is, it is treated as if it were alive, like a lion or some other fierce animal that wants to attack Cain. Some languages can do the same thing. Other languages cannot do that and must say something like: "then you are in great danger of being tempted to sin, but you must resist and not give in." (See: figs-personification)

at the door,
"outside your door {to attack you}," or "outside the door {of your heart} {to attack/tempt you},"

and its desire {is} for you,
"It/Sin desires/wants {to control/destroy} you," Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

but you must rule over it."
"but you must master/control it {so that you do not sin}." or "but you must keep/prevent it {from controlling/destroying you}." or "but you must keep/prevent it {from doing that}."

Gen 4:8 Then Cain spoke to Abel his brother. Then it happened while they were in the field, then Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him.

Then
"But {after that,}" or "Later". After God spoke to Cain, we do not know how long Cain waited before he spoke to Abel; it may have been a few hours or a few days.

Cain spoke to Abel his brother.
"Cain talked to/with his brother Abel." That is what the Hebrew text has. Instead of that text, some ancient manuscripts (including the Samaritan Pentateuch, Septuagint, Latin Vulgate and Syriac) and many modern translations have: "Then Cain said to Abel his brother, "Let's go out to the field {and work} {together}." " or "Then Cain invited/asked his brother Abel to go out to the field with him {to work}." Some translation teams follow the way this verse is translated in a well-known translation, such as in the national language or in a neighboring language. Decide what to do in your translation. The textual variant that you do not use in your translation could be put in a footnote. (See: translate-textvariants)

Then it happened while they were in the field,
"Then/So {they went out} to the field {to work} {together}, and/but while they were there," For some languages it is necessary to make explicit that Cain and Abel actually went to the field. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-explicit)

then Cain rose up against
"Cain attacked" (See: figs-idiom)

Abel his brother 
"his {own} brother Abel" or "his {own} brother" or "him". The Hebrew text keeps repeating the phrase "Abel his brother" to emphasize the seriousness of Cain's crime. Consider the best way to do that in your language. See how you translated "brother" in verse 2. (See: writing-pronouns)

and killed him.
"and murdered him."

Gen 4:9 Then Yahweh said to Cain, "Where {is} Abel your brother?" And he replied, "I do not know. Am I my brother's keeper?" 

Then Yahweh said to Cain,
"Then/Later Yahweh asked Cain," (See: writing-quotations)

"Where {is} Abel your brother?"
"Where {is} your brother Abel?" See how you translated "Abel...brother" in verse 8.

And he 
"He/Cain". Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin this sentence with a conjunction. (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)

replied,
"said/replied {to him}," or "answered {him}," or "responded/retorted," (See: writing-quotations)

"I do not know. 
"How should I know?"

Am I my brother's keeper?"
"Am I my brother's guardian/caretaker?" or "Am I in charge of my brother?" or "Is it my job/responsibility to take care of my brother?" or "It's not my job/responsibility to keep track of my brother!" Cain uses this rhetorical question to support the lie that he just told. His response to God is rude and disrespectful. Consider whether or not a rhetorical question communicates that here in your language. (See: figs-rquestion)


Gen 4:10 Then he said, "What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood is crying out to me from the ground! 

Then he said,
"Then Yahweh asked/exclaimed," Make sure that your translation of this phrase refers to Yahweh, not Cain. (See: writing-pronouns)

"What have you done? 
"What you have done is very horrible/terrible!" or "You have done a horrible/terrible thing!" God uses this rhetorical question to condemn what Cain had done. Consider whether or not a rhetorical question works well here in your language. (See: figs-rquestion)

The voice of your brother's blood is crying out to me from the ground!
"Your brother's blood is calling out to me from the ground {to avenge him}!" or "Your brother's blood on the ground is like a voice/person calling out to me {for justice/revenge}!" or "I see your brother's blood on the ground, and/so I must judge/punish you {for killing/murdering him}!" In the Hebrew text, blood is personified, as if it had a voice or could cry out like a person does. If it is not possible to do that in your language, you could say that his brother's blood is "like a voice...", or you could translate this sentence without personification. (See: figs-personification)


Gen 4:11 So now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand. 

So
"Therefore" or "Because of what you did,"

now you are cursed
"from now on you are cursed {by me}" or "now I am cursing you". See how you translated "you are cursed {by me}" in Gen 3:14. (See: figs-activepassive)

from the ground,
"{so that you will not be able to grow food} from the ground/soil," or "{so that you are banned/banished} from {working/farming} the ground/soil," (See: figs-explicit)

which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood 
"which is covered/soaked with blood from your brother" or "which is where your brother's blood spilled/poured out". In the Hebrew text, "the ground" is personified as if it had a mouth to open. If that is not possible in your language, you could follow one of the alternates above. (See: figs-personification)

from your hand.
"when/after you killed/murdered him."


Gen 4:12 When you work the ground, it will not continue to yield its strength for you. You will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth."

When
"Whenever" or "{As a result,} whenever"

you work the ground,
"you {try to} cultivate/farm the ground/soil," See how you translated "work the ground" in Gen 2:5 and 3:23; also see similar phrases in 4:2, 11.

it will not continue to yield its strength for you.
"it will no longer produce/grow good crops for you." or "it will not produce/grow enough food/harvest for you anymore."

You will
"{From now on,} you will" or "and you will {also}". Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

"be a fugitive/outcast who wanders around on the earth {without a permanent home}." or "be a wandering/homeless fugitive/outcast on the earth." or "{be rejected/shunned by people so that you} have no permanent home and have to move from place to place." The phrase "a fugitive and a wanderer" forms a hendiadys. Consider what is the best way to translate that phrase in your language. (See: figs-hendiadys)

Gen 4:13 Then Cain said to Yahweh, "My punishment {is} greater than I can bear. 

Then Cain said to Yahweh,

Gen 4:14 Behold, today you are driving me from the surface of the ground, and I will be hidden from your presence, and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and it will be everyone who finds me will kill me!"

Behold, 
"Look/Listen," This term emphasizes what Cain says next. See how you translated this term in Gen 1:29 and 3:22. It may be necessary to translate it differently, depending on the context.

today you are driving me
"today you are forcing me away" or "you are now banishing/preventing me". See how you translated "drove/expelled" in Gen 3:24.

from the surface of the ground.
"from {farming/working/cultivating} the ground/land/soil." 

And I will be hidden from your presence,
"I will be separated from you," or "I will be far away from you," or "You will no longer bless me," This clause is probably an idiom that means Cain will be cursed and no longer blessed by God. (See: figs-idiom)

and I will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth,
"and I will be a fugitive/outcast who wanders around on the earth {without a permanent home}," or "and I will be a wandering/homeless fugitive/outcast on the earth," See how you translated this phrase in verse 12. (See: figs-hendiadys)

and it will be
"and" or "so that" or "Besides that," Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

"anyone who" or "whoever". Cain uses hyperbole here to emphasize his strong emotion. If possible, keep this hyperbole in your translation because it helps communicate how fearful Cain was feeling. (See: figs-hyperbole)

"sees/meets me will kill me!" 


Gen 4:15 Then Yahweh said to him, "For that {reason}, anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over!" Then Yahweh put a mark on Cain so that everyone who found him would not strike him. 

Then Yahweh
"So/But Yahweh" or "Yahweh"

said to him,
"said/replied to him/Cain," (See: writing-quotations)

"For that {reason},
"In that case," or "So then," That is what the Hebrew text has. Instead of that text, some ancient translations (such as the Septuagint) and many modern translations have: "Not so/true." or "That will not happen {because}". The textual variant that you do not use in your translation could be put in a footnote. (See: translate-textvariants)

anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance 
"{I will warn everyone that} if anyone kills Cain/you, I will take vengeance/revenge on him {for you}" or "{I will make it clear to everyone that} I will take vengeance/revenge on anyone who kills you" What God says here implies that he will do something to prevent people from killing Cain; he is not just talking about punishing them if they kill him. If necessary, you could make that explicit in your translation. (See: figs-explicit)

seven times over!"
"{and punish him} seven times more {severely} {than I am punishing you}!" 

Then Yahweh put a mark on Cain
"Then Yahweh/he put a {special/distinguishing} sign/symbol on Cain" or "Then Yahweh/he marked Cain with a {special/distinguishing} mark/symbol". We do not know exactly how Yahweh marked Cain, so keep your translation of this clause general (like the Hebrew text is).

so that everyone who found him would not strike him.
"so that anyone who saw/met him would not kill him." or "to warn everyone who saw/met him not to kill him." The phrase "strike him" is used here as an idiom that means "kill him". Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-idiom)
	

Gen 4:16 Then Cain went out from the presence of Yahweh and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.

Then Cain
"After that, Cain"

went out from
"went/traveled away from" or "left"

the presence of Yahweh
"Yahweh" or "the place where Yahweh had been talking to him". Yahweh is everywhere, so this probably means that after talking to Yahweh, Cain left that place. (See: figs-metonymy)

and lived
"and settled" or "started living"

in the land of Nod,
"in the land/region of/called Nod, {which means "wandering,"}" or "in Nod Land," The original readers of the Hebrew text knew that the name "Nod" means "wandering". Usually translators transliterate (copy or borrow) the name from the Hebrew text, and they might also include the meaning of the name in the text or in a footnote. If you do that here, the meaning should be similar to how you translated "wanderer" in verses 12 and 14. (See: translate-names)

east of Eden.
"{which was} east of {the land/region of/called} Eden." or "{which was} east of Eden {Land}." Consider again how you translated "{the land/region of} Eden" and "the Garden of Eden" in the book of Genesis. See Gen 2:8, 10, 15; 3:23-24; 4:16.


4:17-24 Cain's Descendants
  
Gen 4:17 Then Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. And he was building a city, so he called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch.

Then Cain knew his wife
"Then Cain had {marital} relations with his wife," or "Then Cain slept with his wife," See how you translated this idiom in Gen 4:1. (See: figs-euphemism)
 
and she conceived and bore 
"so that she became pregnant and gave birth to". See how you translated this phrase in Gen 4:1. 

Enoch.
"{a son named} Enoch." or "{a son they named} Enoch." or "{a son whose name was} Enoch." (See: figs-explicit)

And 
"And/Now {at/during that time,}" or "{At that time}". Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin this sentence with a conjunction.

he was building a city,
Cain was building a city," Make sure that your translation of this phrase refers to Cain, not Enoch.

so he called the name of the city 
"so he called/named the/that city"

after the name of his son Enoch.
"after his son Enoch." or "Enoch, after his son." or "Enoch, the same name as his son."


Gen 4:18 Then to Enoch was born Irad, and Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech.

Then to Enoch was born
"Later on, Enoch fathered/had" or "When Enoch {grew up,} he fathered/had" or "Enoch was the father of". In this record of Cain's descendants, It is implied that many years have gone by between each descendant growing up, getting married, and having his own children. Decide the best way to translate this genealogical record in your language. (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)

Irad,
"{a son named} Irad," or "{a son whose name was} Irad,"

and Irad fathered
"Then Irad fathered/had" or "When Irad {grew up,} he fathered/had" or "Irad was the father of". Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin a new sentence with each new generation that is mentioned in this verse.

Mehujael,
"{a son named} Mehujael," or "{a son whose name was} Mehujael,"

and Mehujael fathered
"Then Mehujael fathered/had" or "When Mehujael {grew up,} he fathered/had" or "Mehujael was the father of"

Gen 4:19 Then Lamech took two wives for himself. The name of the one {was} Adah, and the name of the second {was} Zillah. 

Then Lamech
"Then Lamech {grew up, and he}" or "When Lamech {grew up,} he"

took two wives for himself. 
"chose two women to be his wives." or "married two wives/women." In this context, the phrase "took for himself" is an idiom that means "married". Consider whether your language has a similar idiom. (See: figs-idiom)

The name of the one {was} Adah,
"His first wife's name was Adah," or "His first wife was named Adah,"

and the name of the second {was} Zillah. 
"and his second wife's name was Zillah." or "and his second/other wife was named Zillah."

the father of {those} who
the ancestor/first of {all} those/people who". The phrase "father of" is used here as an idiom that means Jabal was the first person to do these things. He invented this way of living, and many people after him followed his example. (See: figs-idiom)

live {in} tents
"are tent dwellers" or "live in portable shelters". A tent is a portable living place that has walls made of cloth or animal skins and is held up by poles. Tents are used by people who need to take their home with them as they move from place to place, often to find food and water for themselves and their livestock. If people in your language area are not familiar with tents, you could include some of the above information in a footnote. (See: translate-unknown)

and own livestock.
"and raise livestock/animals {for a living}." The term "livestock" includes all kinds of domestic animals, such as cows, sheep, goats, camels, and donkeys. See how you translated "livestock" in Gen 1:24-26; 2:20, 3:14.


Gen 4:21 And the name of his brother {was} Jubal. He was the father of all who play harps and flutes.

And the name of his brother {was} Jubal.
"His/Jabal's brother's name was Jubal." or "Jabal had a brother named Jubal." Jubal was probably younger than Jabal. See how you translated "brother" in verse 2. (See: translate-kinship)

He was 
"He/who was/became" or "He/Jubal {grew up and} was/became"

the father of all who
"the ancestor/first of all {those/people} who". See how you translated a similar phrase in verse 20.

who forged 
"who/He was {the first person to} forge/make" or "He {was the first blacksmith and} forged/made" or "He {was the ancestor/first of all those/people who} forge/make". It is probably implied from verses 20-21 that Tubal Cain, like his brothers, was the father/ancestor or first of all those who had his skill.

all {kinds} of tools out of bronze and iron.
"all kinds of tools {and other things} out of bronze/brass and iron." or "all kinds of bronze/brass and iron things/tools." The word "tools" that is used here in the Hebrew text is general and can include farming tools and weapons and other things that are made out of metal.

 And the sister of Tubal Cain {was} Naamah.
"Tubal Cain had a sister {named} Naamah." or "Tubal Cain had a sister {whose name was} Naamah."

"listen to what I have to say." or "listen to what I am going to tell you." The phrase "my voice" refers here to the words being said. Consider what is the best way to translate this figure of speech in your language. (See: figs-metonymy)

Wives of Lamech, hear my words:
"My wives, listen to this:" or "My wives, listen to me carefully." This clause forms a parallelism with the previous clause and emphasizes what Lamech says next. (See: figs-parallelism)

For I killed a man for my wound, even a young man for my bruise.
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean: (1) "I killed a man for wounding me; {he was} a young man who bruised/injured me!" or "I killed a young man for wounding/injuring me! In fact, I killed that man for {just} bruising me!" (2) "I killed a man for wounding me, and also a young man for bruising/injuring me." or "A man wounded me, so I killed him. A young man injured me, so I killed him too!" In the first interpretation, Lamech refers to one man he killed. In the second interpretation, he refers to two men he killed.


Gen 4:24 If Cain is avenged seven times, then Lamech {is avenged} seventy-seven times!" 

If Cain is avenged seven times, then

Lamech {is avenged} seventy-seven times!"
"I, Lamech avenge myself seventy-seven times!" or "I avenge myself 77 times!" Lamech is bragging in verses 23 and 24 about how severely he avenges himself. He is not saying that God will avenge him more than he will avenge Cain. Be consistent with how you spelled the name "Lamech" in verses 18-19, 23-24.

"Then Adam slept with his wife {Eve} again," or "Again Adam had {marital} relations with his wife {Eve}," See how you translated the idiom "knew" in 4:1, 17. (See: figs-euphemism)

and she
"so that she" or "with the result that she" (See: grammar-connect-logic-result)

bore a son,
"{conceived and} had a son," or "{became pregnant and} gave birth to a son," 

and she called his name 
"and she named him" or "and she gave him the name". See how you translated a similar phrase in Gen 3:20.

Seth,
"Seth, {which means "appointed/granted/given,"}" (See: translate-names)

because {she had said},
"{She named him that} because {when he was born,} {she had said/exclaimed}," What follows is a direct quote of what Eve had said that gave Seth his name. Make sure that is clear in your language. Also consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. (See: figs-explicit)

"God has appointed for me
"God has granted/given to me". If you include the meaning of Seth's name in your translation or in a footnote, make sure it matches the way you translate "appointed" here, so that it is clear why he was given that name.

another offspring
"another child"

in place of Abel,
"to replace Abel," or "to take the place of Abel,"

since Cain killed him."
"whom Cain killed/murdered." For some language it is necessary to put this phrase first in this clause (so that events are in the order that they happened) and say, "Since Cain killed Abel, God granted me another child to replace him." Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 4:26 And to Seth also a son was born, and he called his name Enosh. Then {people} began to call on the name of Yahweh.

And to Seth also a son was born, 
"{Later on,} Seth also fathered/had a son," The word order in the Hebrew text here emphasizes Seth. Do what is natural in your language.

and he called his name Enosh. 
"and he named him Enosh." or "whom he named Enosh."

Then
"At/During that time" or "That is when"

{people} began to call on the name of Yahweh.
"people began to address God by his name Yahweh as they worshiped him." or "people began to worship/praise Yahweh by name." or "people first called Yahweh by name in their prayers and worship." The phrase "call on the name of Yahweh" is an idiom that refers to prayers, worship, and praise in which people addressed God directly by his personal name Yahweh. It also implies that they were trusting in him to help and guide them. (See: figs-idiom)

5:1-32 The Genealogy/Descendants Of Adam Up To Noah 

Gen 5:1 This {is} the written account of the generations of Adam: On the day God created man{kind}, he made him in the likeness of God.

This {is}
"Here {is}" or "What follows {is}"

the written account
"the written {family} record/history" or "the {family} record"

of the generations of Adam:
"of/about Adam and his descendants:" or "of/about Adam's family-line/genealogy:"

On the day God created man{kind}, he made him 
"On the day {that/when} God created/made human beings, he made them". See how you translated "created" in Gen 1:1, 27; 2:4, and "man" in Gen 1:26-27.

in the likeness of God.
"in his own likeness." or "to be like himself." God created mankind to be like himself in certain ways, not to be exactly like him in every way (Gen 1:26-27).


Gen 5:2 He created them male and female, and he blessed them and called their name "man{kind}" on the day they were created.

He created them male and female,
"He {also} created them {to be} male and female," See how you translated this clause in Gen 1:27.

and he blessed them
"He blessed them". Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Also see how you translated "blessed" in Gen 1:22, 28. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.

and called their name
"and called/named them". See how you translated the phrase "called...name" in Gen 4:17, 25, 26.

"man{kind}"
"human beings". Be consistent here with how you translated this term in verse one.

on the day they were created.
"on the {same} day {that} they were created {by him}." or "on the {same} day {that} he created them." Consider the best way to translate this passive clause in your language. For some languages it is clearer or more natural to put this clause earlier in this verse and say, "and on the {same} day {that} he created them, he blessed them and called/named them human beings." Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

Gen 5:3 And Adam lived 130 years, then he fathered a son in his own likeness, according to his image, and he called his name Seth.

And Adam lived 130 years, then he fathered a son
"When Adam had lived 130 years, he fathered/had a son" or "When Adam was 130 years old, he fathered/had a son". Each translation team needs to decide how they are going to write large numbers in the Bible. Many teams use numerals, for example, "130" here in verse 3, especially if the target language has a complicated counting system. Other teams prefer to use words, for example, "one hundred thirty" here. Be consistent in what you do throughout your translation. (See: translate-numbers)

in his own likeness, according to his image,
"who was {a human being} like himself and looked like him," or "who was like him in many ways," These two phrases have similar meanings and emphasize that Seth was similar to Adam in many ways. See how you translated similar phrases in Gen 1:26. (See: figs-doublet)

and he called his name Seth.
"and he/Adam named him Seth." or "Adam named his/that son Seth." For some languages it is more natural to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language.


Gen 5:4 And the days of Adam after he fathered Seth were 800 years, and he fathered {other} sons and daughters. 

And the days of Adam after he fathered Seth were 
"After he/Adam fathered/had Seth, Adam/he lived" or "After Seth's birth, Adam lived" or "After Seth was born, Adam lived"

800 years,

and he fathered {other} sons and daughters.
"He {also} fathered/had {other} sons and daughters." or "He was {also} the father of {other} sons and daughters." This clause probably refers to all the other children that Adam had, including those who were born before and after Seth was born. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.


Gen 5:5 So all the days of Adam that he lived were 930 years, and he died.

6:1-8 Evil Increases On the Earth

Gen 6:1 And it happened when mankind began to multiply on the surface of the earth and daughters were born to them, 

And
"Now". The events in Gen 6:1-2 started happening long before the events in 5:32, so the way your translation begins this verse should allow for that meaning and not begin with a sequence word like "Then", which would have the wrong meaning here. Many translations omit the conjunction here. Do what is best in your language. (See: grammar-connect-time-background)

it happened when
"it happened that when/as" or "it happened that". This phrase introduces and emphasizes important background information which the following narrative builds on. It also creates suspense so that readers and listeners wonder what will happen next. Some translations leave this phrase out, but that loses some of the suspense. Do what is best in your language. (See: writing-background)

mankind 
"human beings" or "people". See how you translated this term in Gen 5:1-2.

Gen 6:2 then the sons of God saw the daughters of mankind, that they {were} beautiful, so they took wives for themselves from any {of them} that they chose.

then
"then/Then {when those daughters/girls grew up,}" or "{When those daughters/girls grew up,}" Verses 1 and 2 are one long sentence in the Hebrew text. For many languages it is necessary to divide it into two or more shorter sentences. For example, depending on how you began verse one, you could begin verse 2 with a new sentence. Do what is best in your language. 

the sons of God 
"{some} angels" or "{some} supernatural beings". The meaning of Gen 6:2 is not certain and is heavily debated, so it is probably best to translate it fairly literally and possibly include a footnote about what it means. If it is not translated literally, the literal text should be put in a footnote. There are three main views of who "the sons of God" and "the daughters of mankind" refer to: (1) nonhuman, god-like beings (supernatural beings), such as angels (as in Job 1:6, 38:7) or demons who took human form and married the daughters of human beings; 1 Peter 3:19 - 20; 2 Peter 2:4 [HYPERLINK: https://www.esv.org/2%20Pet.%202%3A4/], and Jude 6 [HYPERLINK: https://www.esv.org/Jude%206/] may be referring to this passage. (2) male descendants of Seth (the righteous, chosen family line) who married female descendants of Cain (the unrighteous family line). (3) sons of powerful men, such as judges or rulers (as in Exodus 22:8, Psalm 82:1, 6) who married the daughters of common, poor people.

saw the daughters of mankind, that they {were} beautiful,
"saw that the daughters of human beings {were} beautiful," or "saw that those young women {were} beautiful," or "saw that they {were} {very} beautiful,"

so they took wives for themselves from any {of them} that they chose.
"so they married any {of them} that they wanted to." or "So they chose any/all {of them} that they wanted and married them." Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Also, see how you translated "took/married" in Gen 4:19.


Gen 6:3 Then Yahweh said, "My Spirit will not strive with mankind forever, because they {are} indeed flesh. Therefore their days will be 120 years."

Then Yahweh said,
"Then/So Yahweh said {to himself}," Only make implied information explicit in your translation if it is necessary to prevent wrong meaning or if your language's grammar requires it, so that your translation is easier to read and understand. (See: figs-explicit)

"My Spirit 
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean (1) "My Spirit" or "I", which is a way of God referring to himself (Gen 1:2 is similar). (2) "My spirit", which could refer to God's breath that gives life (as in Gen 2:7). If the text is not translated literally, the literal text should be put in a footnote.

will not
"will no longer"

strive with
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean: (1) "strive/contend with" or "put up

"always," It may be more natural to put this term earlier in this sentence and say, "My Spirit will not always strive with mankind," Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

because they {are} indeed flesh.
"because they {are} certainly/very sinful/corrupt." or "because they {are} only/mere {sinful/corrupt} mortals." The word "flesh" is used here as an idiom that means human beings are "mortal" (that is, their bodies will die) and that they are "sinful/corrupt". The two meanings are interrelated since it is because of sin that their bodies die. In this context, the focus is on their corrupt behavior, which is the reason God will send a flood soon. (See: figs-idiom)

Therefore
"So". Many translations leave this word out. Do what is natural in your language.

their days will be 120 years."
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) "they will have 120 years {to repent}." or "I will give them 120 years {to repent}." (2) "{from now on,} they/people will have/live {no longer than} 120 years." The first interpretation seems to best fit the context of God announcing his plan to judge mankind for their sin (verse 7). This would mean that Noah was 480 years old when God said this (about 20 years before he started having sons; Gen 5:32), since the flood came when he was 600 years old (Gen 7:6); you could put some of that information in a footnote. The second interpretation does not fit with the fact that after God said this, many people lived much longer than 120 years, so it does not seem likely that length of life was his meaning here. 


Gen 6:4 The Nephilim were on the earth in those days and also after that, when the sons of God went to the daughters of mankind, and they bore children for them. They {were} the mighty {ones} who {were} from long ago, the men of renown.

The Nephilim
"{People called} the Nephilim" or "Giants". Most translations transliterate (borrow or copy) the Hebrew word "Nephilim" here. The word means "fallen ones" and probably refers to their fallen (sinful) spiritual state. The Nephilim were the descendants of the sons of God and the daughters of mankind. The only other place in the Bible that the Nephilim are mentioned is centuries later in Numbers 13:32-33, where they are identified as evil giants. Based on that, some translations translate "the Nephilim" as "giants" here in Gen 6:4. (See: translate-names) 

were on the earth
"lived on the earth" or "were living on the earth"

in those days and also after that,
"during that time and also later on," It may be more natural to put this time phrase first in verse 4 and say, "During that time there were Nephilim/giants living on the earth, when..." Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

when
"{That was/happened} when". Consider whether or not it is better to begin a new sentence here in your language.

the sons of God
"angels" or "supernatural beings". Be consistent here with how you translated this phrase in verse 2, and see the important note about that there.

went to 
"slept with" or "had {marital/sexual} relations with". Translate this idiom in a way that is polite and will not shame or embarrass people when this verse is read aloud in public. See how you translated a similar idiom ("knew") in Gen 4:1, 17, 25. (See: figs-euphemism)

the daughters of mankind, 
"the daughters of human beings," or "human women," See how you translated this phrase in verse 2.

and they 
"and those women"

bore children for them.
"gave birth to children for them." or "had children."

They {were}
"The Nephilim {were}" or "Those/Their children {grew up and} {were/became} {the Nephilim who were}" Make sure it is clear in your translation who is being referred to here. (See: writing-pronouns)

the mighty {ones}
"the powerful men/warriors" or "heroes"

who {were} from long ago,
"who lived a long time ago," or "who lived many years ago,"

the men of renown.
"{who/and were} famous men." For some languages it may be more natural to put this phrase earlier in this sentence and say, "They {were} the mighty men of renown who..." or "They {were} the famous mighty men who...."


Gen 6:5 And Yahweh saw that the wickedness of mankind {was} great on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of their hearts {was} only evil all day long.

And Yahweh saw
"Yahweh knew" or "Yahweh was aware". The verb "saw" is used here as an idiom. Consider whether your language has a similar idiom that would fit well here. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-idiom)

that wickedness of mankind {was} great on the earth, 
"how wicked/evil mankind/people had become on the earth," or "that the people on the earth had become very wicked/evil,"

and that every inclination of the thoughts of their hearts 
"and that every intention/desire they had in their hearts/minds" or "and that everything they thought about and desired/wanted". In Hebrew culture the heart is considered the center of thoughts and desires. Consider whether your language has a similar idiom. (See: figs-idiom)

{was} only evil 
"{was} completely evil"

all day long.
"all the time." or "constantly."


Gen 6:6 So Yahweh was sorry that he had made mankind on the earth, and he was grieved in his heart.

So Yahweh 
"As a result, Yahweh/he" or "Yahweh/he" (See: writing-pronouns)

was sorry 
"regretted"

that he had made mankind 
"that he had made/created people/them" or "that he had made/created human beings". See how you translated "mankind" in verses 1, 3, and 5, and consider whether or not it is best to use a pronoun ("them") here in your language. (See: writing-pronouns)

on the earth,
"{to live} on the earth,"

and he was grieved in his heart.
"and his heart was filled with pain/sadness/grief." or "and he was/felt extremely/very sad/grieved." Consider whether your language has a similar idiom that would fit well here. (See: figs-idiom)


Gen 6:7 Then Yahweh said, "I will wipe away mankind whom I created off the surface of the ground, both mankind and animals, and creatures that crawl and the birds of the sky, because I am sorry that I made them."

Then Yahweh said,
"Then/So Yahweh/he said {to himself}," See how you translated this phrase in verse 3. Also make sure that the way you begin verse 7 fits well with the way you begin verse 6.

"I will wipe away 
"I will wash away" or "I will blot out" or "I will completely wipe/destroy". Consider whether your language has a similar idiom that would fit well here. (See: figs-idiom)

mankind whom I created off the surface of the ground,
"{all} the human beings whom I created, from the surface of the earth," or "from the earth {all} the people whom I created," or "all the human beings I made on the earth," 

both mankind and animals,
"{In fact,} {I will destroy} {not just/only} {all} the people, but also {all} the animals," Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

and creatures that crawl 
"and/including the creatures that crawl/move {on/along the ground}"

and the birds of the sky, 
"and {all} the birds {that fly} in the sky/air," or "and {all} the birds"

because I am sorry
"because I am sad/grieved" or "because I regret". See how you translated "was sorry" or "regretted" in verse 6.

that I made them."
"that I {ever} made/created them."


Gen 6:8 But Noah found favor in the eyes of Yahweh.
 
But Noah found favor in the eyes of Yahweh.
"But Noah pleased God." or "But/However Yahweh was pleased with Noah." The idiom "find favor" means to please someone. And the idiom "in the eyes of" refers to someone's opinion about something or someone. Consider whether your language has similar idioms that work well here or whether it is better to translate this sentence without an idiom. (See: figs-idiom)

6:9-22 Noah Prepares For The Flood

Gen 6:9 These {are} the generations of Noah: Noah {was} a righteous man. He was without blemish in his generation. Noah walked with God.

These {are} the generations of Noah: 
"This/Here is {more of} the account/record/history of/about Noah and his descendants/family:" or "What follows tells {more} about Noah and his descendants/family:" Some of Noah's history has already been given in Gen 5:29, 32, and 6:8. What follows tells more about him.

Noah {was}
"He {was}". Consider whether it is better in your language to use a noun or a pronoun here to refer to Noah. (See: writing-pronouns)

a righteous man.
"an upright/good man." or "a man who did what was right." (See: translate-key-terms)
   
He was without blemish in his generation.
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) "He {alone} was blameless/faultless {in God's eyes} among his contemporaries." or "Out of all the people living at that time, Noah/he was the only one {whom God considered} blameless." (2) "He had a blameless/spotless reputation among his contemporaries. or "His contemporaries considered him to be a man of integrity." The phrase "without blemish" is often used in the Bible to describe animals that have no defects. Here it is used as an idiom that means Noah was "blameless/faultless" in an ethical or moral sense, or that he had good integrity, but it does not mean that he was sinless. Consider whether your language has a similar idiom that would work well here. Also the word "generation" refers to people who live during the same time period. (See: figs-idiom)

Noah walked with God.
"{and} he walked {closely/faithfully} with God." or "{and} he lived in a close/faithful relationship with God." Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin a new sentence here. See how you translated this idiom in Gen 5:22, 24. (See: figs-idiom)


Gen 6:10 And Noah fathered three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

And Noah fathered
"Eventually Noah/he fathered/had {his}" or "And {as mentioned before,} Noah/he had". The fact that Noah fathered/had these three sons was already mentioned in Gen 5:32. Make sure that the way you begin this verse in your translation does not sound like he fathered these sons a second time.

three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
"three sons, {namely} Shem, Ham, and Japheth." or "three sons, {whose names were} Shem, Ham, and Japheth."


Gen 6:11 Now the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled {with} violence. 

Now the earth 
"Now {the people of/on} the earth". The phrase "the earth" is often used in the Bible to refer to the people who live on the earth. Consider whether your language can do the same thing, or whether it is necessary to make that implied information explicit. (See: figs-metonymy)

was corrupt 
"had become corrupt/wicked"

before God, 
"in God's sight/opinion," or "according to God's standards," (See: figs-idiom)

and the earth was filled {with} violence.
"and they had filled the earth with {their} violence/lawlessness." or "and all over the earth they were doing violent/lawless things." This clause forms a parallelism with the previous clause in order to emphasize how evil the people on the earth had become. The two clauses are different enough from each other that, if possible, it is best to keep both parts of the parallelism in your translation. Also be consistent with how you translated "the earth" earlier in this verse. (See: figs-parallelism)


Gen 6:12 And God saw the earth, and behold, it was corrupt, because all flesh on the earth had corrupted their ways.

And God saw
"God saw". Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin this sentence with a conjunction.

the earth, and behold, it was corrupt,
"that {everyone on} the earth was indeed/very corrupt/wicked," or "how corrupt/wicked {everyone on} the earth had become," See how you translated "corrupt" and "the earth" in verse 11. (See: figs-metonymy)

because all flesh on the earth
"because all the people on the earth" or "because everyone {living} on earth". The phrase "all flesh" refers here to all people and probably implies that people are mortal (verse 3). (See: figs-synecdoche)

had corrupted their ways.
"were living corrupt/wicked lives." or "were {continually} doing wicked/evil things." or "were {continually} acting/behaving in evil ways."


Gen 6:13 So God said to Noah, "The end of all flesh has come before me, because the earth is filled {with} violence because of them. So behold, I am destroying them with the earth.

So God said to Noah,
"So/Then God/he said to Noah,"

"The end of all flesh has come before me,
"I have decided to put an end to all human beings," or "I am going to destroy all flesh/people," Be consistent here with how you translated "flesh" in verse 12. (See: figs-synecdoche)

because the earth is filled {with} violence because of them.
"because they have filled the earth with {their} violence/lawlessness." or "because all over the earth they are doing violent/lawless things." See how you translated "violence" in verse 11.

So behold,
"Now listen," or "In fact," This phrase draws extra attention to what God says next. Consider the best way to do that in your language. 

I am destroying them
"I am going to destroy them" or "I plan to destroy them" or "I will destroy"

with the earth.
"as well as {everything else on} the earth." or "and {everything else on} the earth {too}." This phrase includes everything on the earth, not just the people. (See: figs-metonym)

Gen 6:14 Make an ark for yourself out of gopher wood. Make the ark {with} rooms, and cover it inside and outside with a covering.

Make 
"{Therefore/Consequently} {you must} make/build" (See: grammar-connect-logic-result)

an ark
"a {very} large boat/houseboat". The term "ark" is general and refers to a chest/box that is closed on all sides, including the top. In this case, the ark was a very large boat that people and many animals lived in for a year. It had no motor, no oars, no sail and no rudder. Since this was a unique, one-of-a-kind boat that may already be well-known as the "ark" in the receptor language area, some translations transliterate (copy or borrow) the word "ark" throughout Genesis. Decide what is best for your translation. (See: translate-transliterate)

for yourself 
"for you/yourself {and your family}" (See: figs-explicit)

out of gopher wood. 
"from gopher/cypress wood {which is good for building boats}." or "out of the best wood {for building boats}." It is not certain what kind of wood this was, so many translations transliterate (copy or borrow) the Hebrew word "gopher". Some Bible scholars think it was cypress wood. (See: translate-unknown)

Make the ark {with} rooms,
"Build/Construct the ark/boat with compartments/stalls {inside}," or "Make/Build rooms inside the ark/boat,"

and cover it inside and outside 
"and {completely} seal/coat it inside and outside" 

with a covering.
"with pitch/tar {to keep water out}." or "with pitch/tar {to keep the boat from leaking}." The Hebrew word "covering" is general and does not specify what kind of waterproofing material is being used. However, many translations are more specific than that here and refer to "pitch" or "tar" or some other material made from tree resin or sap that can seal a boat well and keep it from leaking. 


Gen 6:15 And this {is} how you must make it: the length of the ark {must be} 300 cubits, its width 50 cubits, and its height 30 cubits. 

And this {is} how you must make it:
"Build the ark/boat with these dimensions/measurements:" or "You must make/build the ark/boat like this:"

the length of the ark {must be} 300 cubits, its width 50 cubits, and its height 30 cubits.
"It {must be} 140 meters long, 23/twenty-three meters wide, and 14/fourteen meters high." or "It {must be} 450 feet long, 75/seventy-five feet wide, and 45/forty-five feet high." A cubit was about half a meter (18 inches) long, which was the distance from a man's elbow to the tip of his middle finger. You can (1) translate cubits into meters or feet, and put the literal text in a footnote; or (2) keep "cubits" in the main text (so that the numbers 300, 50 and 30 are kept) and put what that equals in meters or feet in a footnote. (See: translate-bdistance)


Gen 6:16 Make a window for the ark and finish it to within one cubit from the top. And put the door of the ark in its side. Make a lower, a second, and a third deck. 

Make a window for the ark and finish it to within one cubit from the top.
"Make/Build a window/skylight for the ark/boat by finishing {the sides/walls of} the ark/boat to within one cubit below the top/roof {of the ark/boat}." or "Make/Build a half-meter high window/opening between the top of the walls/sides of the ark and its roof {all the way around}, {to let light and air in}." The meaning of the Hebrew text is not completely certain here, but God was probably telling Noah to make a one-cubit high window or opening at the top of the outside walls of the ark, just below the roof, all the way around the ark, to let light and air into the ark. See the note about "cubit" in verse 15. (See: translate-bdistance)

And put the door of the ark in its side.
"Also put/build a door in the side of the ark/boat." or "Put/Build a door for the ark/boat in its side." Some translations begin this sentence without a conjunction ("And" or "Also"). Do what is natural in your language. (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)

Make lower, second, and third {decks}.
"Make/Build a lower {deck/level}, a middle {deck/level}, and an upper {deck/level} {on the inside}." or "{and} make/build a lower, second/middle, and third/upper story/floor {on the inside}." or "{and} make/build three {complete} levels/floors {on the inside}." Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin a new sentence here.


Gen 6:17 And behold me, I am bringing floodwaters on the earth to destroy all flesh that {has} the breath of life in it from under the heavens. Everything that {is} on the earth will expire! 

And behold me,
"Behold me," or "Listen {carefully} to me,"

I am bringing floodwaters on the earth
"I am going to bring/send a flood on/over the {whole/entire} earth" or "I {myself} am going to flood the {whole/entire} earth {with water}". In the Hebrew text, the pronoun "I" is emphatic, both by its form and by its position at the beginning of the sentence. If it is clear and natural in your language, keep that emphasis in your translation of this clause. (See: figs-pronouns)

to destroy
"{in order} to destroy" or "which will destroy". See how you translated "destroy" in verse 13.

all flesh
"all the creatures/beings" or "every creature" or "every living thing". This phrase is general here and includes people and animals, so you may need to translate the phrase differently here from what you did earlier in verses 12-13 (where the focus seems to be on people).

that {has} the breath of life in it
"that breathe/breathes {air}". See how you translated this phrase in Gen 1:30.

from under the heavens. 
"from under the sky." It may be clearer to put this phrase earlier in this sentence and say, "to destroy every living thing under the heavens/sky that has the breath of life in it." Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

Everything that {is} on the earth
"{As a result,} every {living} thing/being that {is/lives} on land" 

will expire! 
"will breathe out {its last breath}!" or "will die/perish!" The verb "expire" (which could also be translated "exhale" or "breathe out") is used here as an idiom that means "die". Consider whether your language has a similar or different idiom that would work well here. (See: figs-idiom)


Gen 6:18 But I will establish my covenant with you, so you must go into the ark, you and your sons and your wife and the wives of your sons with you.

But I will establish
"But/However I will make/institute" or "But/However I will set up". The word "establish" means to deliberately and formally put something into effect. (See: grammar-connect-logic-contrast)

my covenant with you,
"a covenant between me and you," or "a {special/peace} agreement between me and you," This covenant is made up of the unconditional, unbreakable promises that God made to Noah (and all mankind and all other living things) in Genesis 8:2-9:17. The word "testament" is another word for "covenant," so the way you translate "covenant" here could be similar to the way you translate the titles "Old Testament" and "New Testament." (See: translate-key-terms)

so you must go into the ark,
"so you must enter the ark/boat," or "so you must get on board the ark/boat,"
 
you and your sons and your wife and the wives of your sons with you.
"and {take} your sons, your wife, and your sons' wives with you." or "and {take} with you your wife, your sons, and their wives."


Gen 6:19 And from every living creature, from all flesh, you must bring two from each {kind} into the ark to keep alive with you. They must be male and female. 

And from every living creature, from all flesh, you must bring two from each {kind} into the ark
"Also, from every {kind of} living creature, {yes,} from every {kind of} animal, you must bring/take two/pairs of each {kind} into the ark/boat" or "You must also bring/take into the ark/boat two/pairs of every {kind of} living creature, including every {kind of} animal,"

to keep alive with you.
"{in order} to keep {them} alive with you." or "so that they stay alive with you."

They must be male and female.
"They must be male and female {pairs}." or "Each pair must have/include a/one male and a/one female." or "Make sure that there are male and female {pairs} {of each kind}."


Gen 6:20 From the birds according to their kinds, and from the animals according to their kinds, from every creature that moves on the ground according to its kind, two from every {kind} will come to you to keep alive.

From the birds according to their kinds,
"{Males and females} from/of every kind of bird," 

and from the animals according to their kinds,
"and from/of {every} kind of animal,"

from every creature that moves on the ground according to its kind,
"including every kind of creature that moves/lives on the ground/land," This phrase emphasizes that the birds and animals mentioned in the first half of this verse lived on land.

two from every {kind} will come to you 
"two/pairs of every kind {of animal} will come to you" or "two/pairs of each kind {of animal} will come to you". For some languages it is more natural to change the order of clauses in this sentence and say, "Two/Pairs of every kind of bird and every kind of animal, including every kind of creature that moves on the ground, will come to you" Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

to keep alive.
"to keep {them} alive {on/in the ark/boat}." or "{into the ark} so that they stay alive." or "so that you keep them alive {in the ark/boat}."


Gen 6:21 And you must take with you some of every food that is eaten and store it with you, and it will be food for you and for them." 

And you
"You" or "You {and your family}". Although the pronoun "you" is singular in the Hebrew text in verse 21, it could be translated as plural, since God's instructions apply to Noah and his family, not just Noah. Or you could make his family explicit. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-yousingular)

must take
"must {also} {gather and} take/bring" or "must {also} gather"

every food 
"every {kind of} food" or "all the different kinds of food"

 that is eaten 
"that people and animals eat" or "that you and {all} the animals/creatures will need"

and store it with you, 
"and store/stockpile/put it {on the ark/boat} with you,"

and it will be food 
"This/That will be the food supply" or "so that there will be {enough} food". Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin a new sentence here.

for you 
"for you {and your family}". Consider again how you translated the pronoun "you" in this verse. (See: figs-yousingular)

and for them."
"and for {all} the animals." (See: writing-pronouns)
 

Gen 6:22 And Noah did {that}; according to all that God had commanded him, so he did.

And Noah did {that};
"So, {that is what} Noah did;" or "Noah did {all of that}". Some translations begin verse 22 without a conjunction. Do what is best in your language. (See: grammar-connect-time-sequential)

according to all that God had commanded him, so he did.
"he did everything just/exactly as God had commanded/told him {to do}."


7

7:1-23 Yahweh/God Sends The Flood

Gen 7:1 Then Yahweh said to Noah, "Go into the ark, you and all your household, because I have seen that you {are} righteous before me in this generation. 

Then Yahweh
"Then {after they had finished building the boat,} Yahweh" or "{When/After the ark/boat was finished,} Yahweh". For some languages it may be necessary to make it explicit that the boat was completed before Yahweh told Noah to enter it. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-explicit)

said to Noah,
"told/commanded Noah," (See: writing-quotations)

"Go into the ark, you and all your household,
"Enter/Board the ark/boat, along with your entire family," or "You and your entire household/family must go/get into the ark/boat," See how you translated "ark/boat" in Gen 6:14-16.

because I have seen
"because I have found" or "because I see/know"

that you {are}
"that you {alone} {are}" or "that you {are} {the only one who is}". In the Hebrew text, the pronoun "you" is emphasized to show that Noah was the only one who was righteous.

righteous
"upright" or "living righteously/rightly" or "living the right way". See how you translated "righteous" in Gen 6:9.

before me 
"in my sight/eyes/opinion" or "according to my standards"

in this generation.
"among the people living today." For some languages it may be more natural to put this phrase earlier in this verse and say, "...you {are} {the only one} among the people living today {who is} righteous in my sight." Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 7:2 From every clean animal take with you seven pairs, a male and its female, and from {every} animal that {is} not clean {take} two, a male and its female,

From every clean animal
"From every {kind of} pure animal" or "From every {kind of} animal that is acceptable to sacrifice". It may be necessary to include a footnote that explains the concept of clean and unclean animals: In the Bible a "clean animal" was an animal that was acceptable to be sacrificed to God or to be eaten, and an "unclean animal" was one that could not be sacrificed or eaten; it does not refer to how clean the animal was physically. Later Moses wrote down the laws about clean and unclean animals in the book of Leviticus.

take with you 
"bring with you". The pronoun "you" is singular in the Hebrew text, but could be translated as a plural to include Noah's family. (See: figs-yousingular)

seven pairs, a male and its female,
"seven male and female pairs". See how you translated "male and female" in Gen 6:19.

and from {every} animal that {is} not clean
"and from {every kind of} unclean/impure animal" or "and from {every kind of} animal that is not acceptable to sacrifice"

{take} two, a male and its female,
"{take} a/one male and female pair," For some languages it may be better to change the order of the phrases in this sentence and say, "Take with you seven male and female pairs of every {kind of} clean/pure animal, and {one} male and female pair of {every kind of} unclean/impure animal," Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 7:3 also from {every} bird of the sky {take} seven pairs, male and female, to keep {their} offspring alive on the surface of the whole earth,

also 
"{and} also" or "In addition," or "Also," Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

from {every} bird of the sky 
"from {every kind/type of} bird {that flies} in the sky/air" or "from {every kind/type of} bird"

{take} seven pairs, male and female, 
"{take} seven male and female pairs". See how you translated a similar phrase in verse 2. Also, for some languages it may be better to put this phrase earlier in this sentence and say, "Also {take} seven male and female pairs of {every kind of} bird {that flies} in the sky/air,..." Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

to keep {their} offspring alive
"so that {later} their offspring will live" or "so that {later} they will have offspring that will live" 

on the surface of the whole earth,
"{and spread} all over the earth," or "and/to repopulate the whole/entire earth,"


Gen 7:4 because in seven more days I will cause it to rain on the earth {for} forty days and forty nights, and I will wipe every living thing that I have made off the surface of the ground." 

because 
"{You must do that,} because" or "The reason {you must do that} is". For many languages it is more natural to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-explicit)

in seven more days 
"seven days from now/today". The phrase, "seven more days" could be translated "another week" here and in verse 11. However, it is probably best to keep the number seven in the text in both places, especially since the number seven often signifies perfection or completion in the Bible, perhaps also here.

I will cause it to rain
"I will make it rain {continuously}" or "I will send rain"

on the earth

Gen 7:6 Now Noah {was} a son of 600 years when the floodwaters came on the earth. 

Now Noah {was} a son of 600 years when
"Noah/He was 600 years old when" or "When Noah was 600 years old," See how you handled large numbers in Gen 5 and in Gen 6:3, and see the note about this at Gen 5:3. Also see how you translated the idiom "son of...years" in Gen 5:32. (See: translate-numbers)

the floodwaters came on the earth.

Gen 7:7 And Noah and his sons and his wife and the wives of his sons went with him into the ark from the presence of the waters of the flood.

And Noah and his sons and his wife and the wives of his sons went with him into the ark
"{That is when} Noah/he and his wife, and his sons and their wives, went together into the ark/boat". Noah and his family entered the ark on the same day that the floodwaters started coming (see verses 11-13). See how you translated a similar list of people in Gen 6:18.

The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean (1) "including every {kind of} creature/animal that moves/lives on land" or "which includes every {kind of} creature/animal that moves/lives on land". According to this interpretation, the rest of verse 8 emphasizes that the clean and unclean animals and birds (verses 2-3, 8) were all creatures that lived on land (which are the creatures that the flood affected). (2) "as well as every {kind of} creature/animal that crawls/creeps along the ground". According to this interpretation, the rest of verse 8 refers to a fourth category of creatures besides the clean animals, unclean animals, and birds.

Gen 7:10 And it happened, after the seven days, then the waters of the flood came on the earth. 

And it happened, 
"So it happened {that}" or "Then". This phrase focuses attention on an important event (the beginning of the flood), and it builds suspense so that readers and listeners wonder what will happen next.

after the seven days,
"when the seven days {that God had spoken about} had passed," or "after seven days," This phrase refers to the seven days which God talked about in verse 4. It does not mean seven days after Noah and the animals went into the ark (verses 7-9); they went into the ark on the same day that the flood started (verse 13). Translate the beginning of this sentence in a way that makes that clear. (See: figs-explicit)

Verses 13-16 repeat what happened, in order to emphasize it. Make sure that a translation does not sound like this is the second (or third) time that Noah and his family and the animals entered the ark.

every living creature according to its kind, and
In the Hebrew text this phrase is ambiguous. It can mean (1) "every kind of living creature/thing, including" (2) "every kind of wild animal, and". The animal groups listed in verse 14 show that every kind of animal was to be brought onto the ark. Your language may have a different way of grouping animals. Make sure it is clear in your translation of this verse that all the different kinds of birds and land animals are included.

every livestock according to its kind,
"every kind of livestock," or "every kind of domestic/tame animal,"

and every creature that moves on the earth according to its kind,
In the Hebrew text, this phrase is ambiguous. It can mean (1) "and every {other} kind of creature/animal that moves/lives on the earth/land," which seems to fit this context best. (2) "and every kind of creature/animal that crawls on the ground,"

and every bird according to its kind, every bird of every wing.
"and every kind of bird {and} everything {else} that has wings." or "and every kind of bird {and} every {other} {kind of} creature that flies." This phrase probably refers not only to birds, but also to other creatures that have wings and fly, such as bats and insects.

But God remembered
"God kept in mind" or "But God did not forget" or "God never forgot". The phrase "God remembered" is an idiom in the Bible that often means God was paying special attention to certain people and was about to do something.

a freshly picked olive leaf in its mouth.
"a newly picked {green} leaf from an olive tree in its mouth/beak." or "a {green} leaf in its mouth/beak that it had just picked/taken from an olive tree." An olive tree produces small, oval, green fruit that has a hard pit. Olives are used for food and as a source of cooking oil. If olive trees are unknown in your language area, you could include a footnote about them. (See: translate-unknown)

In the Hebrew text this phrase is ambiguous. It can mean (1) "and every {other} creature/animal that moves/lives", which seems to fit this context best since it is general and includes all the land animals that were not birds or livestock. (2) "and every creature/animal that crawls", which is more specific and refers to animals like lizards, snakes, mice, and other animals that have bodies that are close to the ground.

See how you translated this list of Noah's family members (and similar lists) in Gen 6:18; 7:7, 13; 8:16. Notice that the order of the people in this list varies in the Hebrew text, perhaps depending on who is in focus in each context.

Then Noah built an altar 
"Then Noah built/made an altar {out of large stones}" or "Then Noah built/made a {sacrifice} table/mound {with large stones}". An altar was an elevated, often table-shaped structure made out of stones where certain animals and crops were burned as sacrifices to God. (See: translate-key-terms)

took from every clean animal and from every clean bird,
"selected/chose {some/one} from/of every {kind of} clean/pure animal and {some/one of} every {kind of} clean/pure bird," or "selected/chose {some/one} from/of every {kind of} animal and bird that are acceptable to sacrifice". In the Bible, a "clean" animal or bird is one that is acceptable to be sacrificed to God or eaten; it does not refer to how clean the animal or bird was physically. See how you translated this term in Gen 7:2, 8.

"and he {killed them and} offered/sacrificed them as burnt offerings {to Yahweh} on the altar." or "and he {killed them and} burned {their bodies} on the altar as offerings/gifts {to Yahweh} {to worship/honor/thank him}."

"summer and winter," The seasons of summer and winter may be described differently depending on which part of the world your language area is located in. For example, some translations might use the terms "dry season" and "rainy/wet season", depending on what best corresponds to summer and winter in that area.

24:1-67 Abraham Gets A Wife For Isaac

Gen 24:1  Now Abraham was old, advanced in days, and Yahweh had blessed Abraham in everything. 

Now Abraham was old, advanced in days, 
"Abraham had lived a long time and was {now} {very} old," or "Abraham was very old now. He had lived many years," or "Now Abraham had become very old," Verse one gives the setting for the new episode and begins with a doublet that emphasizes how old Abraham was. Try to preserve this emphasis in a way that is natural in your translation. (See: figs-doublet)

and Yahweh had blessed Abraham
"and Yahweh had blessed him" or "and Yahweh had caused him to prosper". See how you translated "bless" in Gen 12:2-3.

"in everything {he had done}." or "in every way."


Gen 24:2 Then Abraham said to his oldest servant of his house who was in charge of everything that belonged to him, "Please put your hand under my thigh,

"the oldest servant in his household" or "his senior/chief household servant"

who was in charge of 
"who managed" or "who took care of"
 
everything that belonged to him,
"everything that he owned," or "his entire estate for him," 

Please put your hand under my thigh,
"Please put your hand under my thigh/leg {to show that you will do what I ask}". You can make the meaning of this custom explicit in your translation, or you can put that information in a footnote. What Abraham asks his servant to do here is part of the vow-making process in verse 3. (See: translate-symaction)


Gen 24:3  and I will have you swear by Yahweh, the God of the heavens and the God of the earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites whom I am living among,

"I want you to vow {to me}" or "and swear/vow {to me}" or "and make an unbreakable promise {to me}". Decide the best way to translate this command in your language. Also, see how you translated "swear" in Gen 21:23, and see the note about that there. (See: figs-imperative)

by Yahweh, the God of the heavens and the God of the earth, 
"with Yahweh as your witness, the God who rules/created the heavens and the earth," See how you translated "the heavens and the earth" in Gen 1:1.

that you will not take a wife for my son from
"that you will not get/find/choose a wife/woman for my son {Isaac} {to marry} from {among}" or "that you will not arrange for my son {Isaac} to marry". For some languages it is clearer and more natural to make "Isaac" explicit here in verse 3, rather than wait until the end of verse 4. Do what is best in your language. Also, see how you translated the idiom "took a wife for" in Gen 21:21. (See: figs-idiom)

the daughters of the Canaanites whom I am living among,
"the Canaanite women whom we live among" or "{any of} the Canaanite women who live around us here". Make sure your translation does not sound like Abraham was living by himself among the Canaanites; his family and servants also lived among them with him.


Gen 24:4 but you will go to my country and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son, for Isaac."

but you will go
"Rather/Instead you must go" or "Rather/Instead I want you to go" (See: figs-imperative)

to my country
"to my {home} country" or "to the country/region where I grew up" or "to the country that I came from"

and to my relatives,
"to my relatives/family/kinfolk {who live there}"

and take a wife for my son, for Isaac.
"and find/choose a wife/woman {from there} for my son Isaac {to marry}." or "and get/choose a wife/woman {from among them} for him {to marry}." or "and arrange for him to marry one of their daughters." The way you refer to Isaac here will depend on how you refer to him in verse 3.

Yahweh, the God of the heavens, 
"{because} Yahweh, the God who rules/created the heavens," Make sure it is clear in your translation that verse 7 gives the reason for verse 6. Also, see how you translated "the God of the heavens" in verse 3.

who took me from the house of my father

To your offspring I will give this land, 
"I  will give this land to your offspring/descendants" or "that he would give this land {where we live} to my descendants". The phrase "this land" refers to the land of Canaan here, not the land where Abraham's relatives lived. Make sure that is clear in your translation. Also, consider whether it is more natural here in your language to use a direct quote or an indirect quote. (See: figs-quotations)

he will send his angel before you, 
"He will send one of his angels ahead of you {to guide/help you}," If you begin a new sentence here, make sure that the previous sentence is well-formed and complete in your language. Also, see how you translated "angel" in Gen 22:11,15.

"so that you will {be able to} find/choose" or "so that you can find/get".

Then the servant 
"So the/Abraham's servant"

"put his hand under his master/owner Abraham's thigh/leg". See how you translated a similar clause in verse 2. Also, in that culture, people owned servants and had complete authority over them. Make sure your translation of "master" and "servant" does not imply that the servant was mistreated. Servants were treated well, could hold important positions and were often considered as members of the master's family. See how you translated a related term "mistress/owner" in Gen 16:4, 8-9. (See: translate-symaction)

Gen 24:10  Then the servant took ten camels from the camels of his master and left, and all kinds of good things from his master were in his hand, and he got up and went to Aram Naharaim, to the city of Nahor. 

Then the servant 
"Then/Next he" (See: grammar-connect-time-sequential)

took ten camels from the camels of his master
"got ten of his master's camels ready {for the trip}". Make sure that your translation of "took" does not imply that the servant stole the camels or valuable things from Abraham. Rather, the "good things" that he loaded on the camels included things that he would give as gifts to Isaac's relatives (verse 53). Also, see how you translated "camels" in Gen 12:16.

and left, and all kinds of good things from his master were in his hand, and he got up and
"and left {with some other servants}, taking with him many of his master's valuable things {to give as gifts}. Then he" or "and after he loaded them with all kinds of valuable things from his master {to use as gifts}, he left {with some other servants} and". For some languages, it is best to make it explicit here in verse 10 that other servants went with Abraham's chief servant, rather than have them appear suddenly in verse 32. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-explicit)

went to
"made the {long} journey/trip to" or "traveled to". This was about a 500 mile (800 kilometer) trip and would take camels about seventeen days to complete.

Aram Naharaim,
"{the region of} Aram Naharaim,"

to the city of Nahor.
"to Nahor's city." or "to the city where Nahor lived." Nahor lived in the city of Haran (Gen 11:31-32). That information could be put in a footnote. Make sure your translation of this phrase does not sound like Nahor owned the city.


Gen 24:11  Then he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at evening time, at the time the women who draw water come out. 

Then he made the camels kneel down outside the city
"{When they arrived there,} Abraham's servant had the camels kneel/lie down {to rest} outside the city"

by the well of water 
"near its well" or "by/near the {community/public} well {that was there}". Each town or city had a well where people from the city came to get their water. See how you translated "well of water" in Gen 21:19. You might translate this slightly differently here because of the different context.

at evening time,
"It was evening time," Consider whether or not it is more natural to begin a new sentence here in your language.

at the time the women who draw water come out.
"the time when the {young} women {of the city} came out to draw/get water {from the well} {for their families/homes}." or "when the {young} women {of the city} were starting to come out {to the well} to draw/get water {for their families/homes}." In that time and culture, there was no running water in homes so people had to come out to the city well to get water for their families. (See: figs-explicit)

Gen 24:13  Behold, I am standing by this spring of water, and the daughters of the people of the city are coming out to draw water. 

Behold, I am standing by
"Look/See, {here} I am, standing beside/near" or "As you see/know, I am standing {here} beside/near". Make sure in your translation that what Abraham's servant says here to Yahweh sounds polite and respectful, not rude, demanding or complaining. Also, he is not telling God something that God did not already know. (See: writing-politeness)

this spring of water,
"this spring/well," or "this spring-fed well". The phrase "spring of water" (here and in verse 16) refers to the same well that is referred to in verses 11 and 20, which means that this was probably a spring-fed well. Some translation teams use only one term to refer to this spring or well throughout this chapter in order to prevent confusion. Decide what is best in your language.

Gen 24:14  And let it be that the young woman whom I say to her, 'Please let down your jar so that I may drink,' and she says, 'Drink and I will also water your camels,' let her be the one you have appointed for your servant, for Isaac. And by her I will know that you have shown kindness toward my master."

And let it be that 
"{Please} make it happen that" (See: writing-politeness)

the young woman whom I say to her, 
"when I say to one of the young women," The phrase "young woman" is actually a single word in Hebrew (like the old English words "damsel" and "maiden") and refers to a young woman who is old enough to get married, but has never been married before. Some languages have a single word for this; other languages prefer a phrase. Also, for some languages it is clearer and more natural to make one or both of the following two embedded direct quotes into indirect quotes. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-quotesinquotes)

'Please let down your jar 
"Please lower your {water} jar/jug/pot". The water containers that people used were usually made out of clay.

so that I may drink,'
"so that I can drink {some water}," or "so that I can have/take a drink {of water}," 

and she says, 
"and/if she says/replies {to me}," or "she will say {to me},"

'Drink and I will also water your camels,'
"Have/Take a drink, and I will also draw/get water for your camels"

let her be the one you have appointed 
"Then I will know that she is the one you have chosen" 

for your servant, for Isaac.
"{as a wife} for your servant Isaac." or "to be the wife of Isaac who serves you,"

And by her I will know that you have shown kindness toward my master.
"and that you have been kind/gracious to my master {Abraham}." See how you translated "show kindness toward" in verse 12.

Gen 24:15  Then it happened before he had finished speaking, then behold Rebekah was coming out, who was born to Bethuel, the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, the brother of Abraham. And her water jar was on her shoulder.

Then it happened before he had finished speaking, 
"Before Abraham's servant had {even} finished speaking/praying {to God}," Many translations omit the phrase "Then it happened", but this phrase emphasizes the events that follow it and adds suspense, so that the audience wonders what the outcome will be. Do what is natural in your language.

then behold 
"just then {he saw}" or "suddenly {he saw}". This spotlights Rebekah and shows that she is the center of attention.

Rebekah was coming out, 
"{a young woman named} Rebekah coming out {of the city}". Consider what is the best way in your language to introduce Rebekah here for the first time in this episode. Some translations use an exclamation mark here to help show the excitement. (See: writing-participants)

who was born to Bethuel, 
"She was the daughter of Bethuel," or "Her father was Bethuel,"

the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, the brother of Abraham.
"{who was} the son of Milcah and Abraham's brother Nahor." or "and his/Bethuel's parents were Abraham's brother Nahor and Milcah." 

And her water jar was on her shoulder.
"She was carrying her/a water jug on her shoulder." or "She had her/a water jar/jug on her shoulder." It may be more natural to put this clause earlier in this verse and say, "Rebekah was coming out {of the city} with/carrying her/a water jar/jug on her shoulder." Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 24:16  And the young woman was a very beautiful-looking virgin, and a man had not known her. And she went down to the spring, and filled her jar and came up.

And the young woman was a very beautiful-looking virgin, 
"She/Rebekah was a very beautiful unmarried young woman". See how you translated "young woman" in verses 14 and 15.

and a man had not known her. 
"whom no man had ever slept with." See how you translated the idiom "not known a man" in Gen 19:8. (See: figs-idiom)

And she went down 
"She went/walked down". Notice that the spring or well was at a place that was lower than the place where Abraham's servant was standing.  

to the spring,
"to the spring/well," or "to the spring-fed well," See how you translated "spring" in verse 13.

and filled her jar
"filled her jar/jug {with water}"

and came up.
"and came/walked {back} up {with/carrying it on her shoulder}." If it is not clear, you may need to make it explicit in your translation that Rebekah still had the jar with her when she came up from the well or spring, especially since she lowers it from her shoulder in verse 18. (See: figs-explicit)

Gen 24:17  Then the servant ran to meet her and said, "Please let me drink a little water from your jar." 

Then the servant 
"Then {Abraham's} servant"

ran to meet her 
"ran/hurried to meet the young woman" or "ran up to her"

and said,
"and said {to her}," or "and requested," (See: writing-quotations)

Please let me drink a little water from your jar.
"Please let me have a little water to drink from your jar/jug." or "Please give me a little drink/water from your jar/jug."
    

Gen 24:18  And she said, "Drink, my lord." Then she hurried and lowered her jar to her hands and gave him a drink.

And she said, 
"She replied," (See: writing-quotations)

Drink, my lord. 
"{Please} have a drink, sir." or "{Certainly,} sir, {you may} have a drink." Make sure that Rebekah's reply is polite and respectful in your language, though the way she addresses Abraham's servant should not make it sound like she is his slave. Also see how you translated "my lord" in Gen 23:6, 11, 15. (See: grammar-honorifics)

Then she hurried and lowered her jar to her hands
"Then she quickly lowered her jar/jug {from her shoulder} to her hands" (See: figs-explicit)

and gave him a drink.
"and let him drink {some water} {from it}." or "and let him have a drink." 


Gen 24:19  And after she finished giving him a drink, then she said, "I will also draw water for your camels until they have finished drinking."

And after she finished giving him a drink, 
"After he finished drinking," or "After that,"

then she said,
"she said/offered {to him}," (See: writing-quotations)

I will also draw water for your camels
"Let me also draw/get water for {all} your camels"

until they have finished drinking.
"until they have had enough to drink."


Gen 24:20  Then she hurried and emptied her jar into the trough, and ran back to the well to draw water, and she drew water for all his camels. 

Then she hurried and emptied her jar
"Then/So she quickly emptied/poured {the rest of the water from} her jar/jug". See how you translated "Then she hurried and" in verse 18.

into the trough,
"into the {animal} {drinking} trough/place {that was there}," or "into the {stone} trough/container/thing {that was there for animals to drink out of}," The drinking trough was a long, open stone container that several animals could drink from at the same time. (See: translate-unknown)

and ran back to the well to draw water,
"and ran back {and forth} to the well to draw/get {more water},"

and she drew water for all his camels.
"until she had drawn/brought {enough} for all of the camels."     


Gen 24:21  And the man watched her silently to know whether Yahweh had made his journey succeed or not.

And the man watched her silently 
"Meanwhile the/Abraham's servant silently watched her/Rebekah {and waited}" or "While she/Rebekah was doing that, the/Abraham's servant silently watched her". Starting in verse 21 the Hebrew text takes Rebekah and Laban's perspective and refers to Abraham's servant as "the man". This continues until verse 34, when the servant tells everyone that he is Abraham's servant. For some languages this is confusing (because it sounds like two different people), so for those languages it is necessary to refer to him as "Abraham's servant" or "the servant" throughout this chapter. (See: writing-participants)

to know whether Yahweh had made his journey succeed or not.
"to find out whether or not Yahweh had made him successful on his journey/trip {to find a wife for Isaac}." or "to know/see for sure whether/if Yahweh had given him success on his journey/trip." (See: figs-infostructure)

Gen 24:22  Then it happened, when the camels had finished drinking, then the man took out a gold nose ring, its weight was a beka, and two gold bracelets for her arms, their weight was ten shekels.

Then it happened, when the camels had finished drinking, 
"Finally, when the camels had finished drinking," or "After {all} the camels had drunk as much water as they wanted {and Rebekah had stopped drawing/fetching water}," (See: figs-explicit)

then the man 
"the/Abraham's servant"

took out a gold nose ring, its weight was a beka,
"brought out a gold nose ring weighing one beka {and gave it to Rebekah/her}" or "gave {Rebekah/her} a gold nose ring that weighed one beka". Many translation teams keep the numbers and the names of weights that are used in the Bible text in their translation, and they may or may not put the modern equivalents in pounds or grams in a footnote. Other teams do the opposite. One beka was about 1/5 of an ounce (5.5 grams), and ten shekels (see below) was about 4 ounces (110 grams). (See: translate-bweight)

and two gold bracelets 
"He also gave her two gold bracelets". Consider whether it is more natural in your language to start a new sentence here. 

for her arms,
"for her wrists". The Hebrew term is ambiguous here; it can refer to hands, arms or wrists. However in this context, the bracelets would have been put on the arms or the wrists.

their weight was ten shekels.
"that weighed ten shekels {each}." or "Each bracelet weighed ten shekels." (See: translate-bweight)


Gen 24:23  And he said, "Whose daughter are you? Please tell me. Is there a place at the house of your father for us to lodge?"

And he said,
"Then he said {to her/Rebekah}," or "Then he asked {her/Rebekah}," (See: writing-quotations)

Whose daughter are you? Please tell me. 
"Please tell me who your father is." The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. The phrase "Please tell me" can go: (1) with the previous question; or (2) with the following question. Since Abraham's servant's goal is to find a wife for Isaac who is one of Abraham's relatives, the first interpretation seems most likely.

Is there a place at the house of your father
"{Also,} is there {enough} room/space at/in his house" or "{Also,} does your father have enough/any room in/at his house". If you made "your father" explicit in the previous sentence, it may be more natural to refer to him with the pronoun "his" in this sentence. (See: writing-pronouns)

for us
"for me and my men". The pronoun "us" includes other servants who came with Abraham's chief servant (as verse 32 shows). If your language has inclusive and exclusive forms of this pronoun, you should use the exclusive form here. (See: figs-exclusive)

to lodge?
"to spend the night {there}?" or "to stay {there} tonight?"


Gen 24:24  Then she said to him, "I am the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah, whom she bore for Nahor."

Then she said to him, 
"She/Rebekah answered him," or "She/Rebekah replied," (See: writing-quotations)

I am the daughter of Bethuel, 
"My father is Bethuel," or "Bethuel is my father," or "My father's name is Bethuel"

the son of Milcah, whom she bore for Nahor. 
"{who is} a son of Milcah and Nahor." or "{and he is} one of Nahor and Milcah's sons." or "and his parents are Nahor and Milcah." Make sure the way you translate this does not sound like Bethuel was the only son of Milcah and Nahor; they had eight sons (Gen 22: 21-22). Also, in some cultures the father's name is normally given first; in other cultures the mother's name is normally first.


Gen 24:25  Then she said to him, "Plenty of both straw and fodder are with us. There is also a place to lodge." 

Then she said to him,
"Then she added/continued," Some languages leave this quote margin implied here, because the same person is still talking to the same person. Other languages can keep the quote margin (like the Hebrew text does), to emphasize what Rebekah says next. The quote margin may also indicate that Rebekah paused before she said what she says in verse 25. (See: writing-quotations)

Plenty of both straw and fodder are with us.
"We have plenty of both straw and {other} feed {at our house} {for the/your camels to eat}," The term "fodder" refers to dry feed that is prepared for animals to eat; it can include chopped hay and grains such as oats and barley.
   
There is also a place 
"{and there is} also {enough} room {at/in his/our house} {for all of you}" 

to lodge.
"to spend the night {there}." or "to stay {there} tonight." See how you translated this in verse 23.


Gen 24:26  Then the man bowed down and prostrated himself before Yahweh,

Then the man bowed down and prostrated himself before Yahweh,
"Then the/Abraham's servant bowed to the ground and worshiped Yahweh". See how you translated "bowed" in Gen 18:2; 19:1. The word "prostrated" means he bowed low to the ground and touched his face or forehead to the ground with outstretched arms, in an act of worship. When combined with "bowed down" as in this verse, it is usually translated as "worshiped". (See: translate-symaction)


Gen 24:27  and said, "Praised be Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who has not abandoned his kindness and his faithfulness toward my master. As for me, Yahweh has led me on the road to the home of the relatives of my master!"

and said, 
"saying," or "He said," The servant is worshiping God by bowing down and by what he says in verse 27.

Praised be Yahweh,
"Praise Yahweh," or "I praise Yahweh," See how you translated this in Gen 9:26.

the God of my master Abraham,
"the God {who takes care} of my master Abraham" or "{who is} the God whom my master Abraham worships/serves". See how you translated "God of my master Abraham" in verse 12.

who has not abandoned his kindness and his faithfulness toward my master. 
"He has never stopped being kind and faithful to my master" or "He has always been kind and faithful to my master". See how you translated "kindness" in verses 12 and 14.  The phrase "not abandoned" is a way of emphasizing that Yahweh had always been kind and faithful to Abraham. (See: figs-litotes)

As for me, Yahweh has led me on the road
"and he has guided me on the road/journey {here}" or "{Yes,} Yahweh/he guided me on the/my journey/trip {here}". The last part of verse 27 is what  Abraham's servant is praising God for; it is an example of how God has been kind and faithful to Abraham.

Gen 24:28 Then the young woman ran and told the household of her mother about those things. 

Then the young woman
"Then Rebekah". See how you translated "young woman" previously in this chapter and consider what is the best way to refer to Rebekah here.

ran
"ran/hurried {home}"

and told
"and reported to" or "and shared the news with" 

the household of her mother
"{the people in} her mother's household/family" 

about those things.
"about what had happened." or "about what the man/servant had said to her."


Gen 24:29  Now Rebekah had a brother and his name was Laban, and Laban ran to the man outside at the spring.

Now Rebekah had a brother 
"Now {it so happened that} Rebekah had a brother" or "Rebekah had a brother". Laban was Rebekah's older brother. Some languages have a specific term for "older brother" that fits well here. Also consider the best way to introduce this background information in your language. (See: grammar-connect-time-background)

and his name was Laban,
"whose name was Laban" or "named Laban"

and Laban ran 
"and he ran/hurried/rushed" or "Laban/He ran/hurried"  (See: writing-pronouns)

to the man outside at the spring.
"out to the spring/well where the man/servant was." or "to where the man/servant was standing beside the spring/well."


Gen 24:30 And it was when he had seen the nose ring, and the bracelets on the arms of his sister, and when he had heard the words of Rebekah his sister saying, 'This is what the man said to me,' then he went to the man, and behold he was standing by the camels at the spring.

And it was when he
"This is how it was/happened: When he/Laban" or "As soon as he/Laban".  Verse 30 is a flashback of what had happened before Laban ran to the well (verse 29). Consider the best way to express this in your language. For some languages it may be necessary to combine verses 29-30 and put the sentences in the order that things actually happened. For example, "Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban. When he saw the nose ring and the bracelets that she was wearing, and heard her tell what the man had said to her, he hurried out to meet the man. He found/saw him standing with his camels beside the well." If you do this, you would mark these combined verses as 29-30. (See: translate-versebridge)

had seen the nose ring, and the bracelets on the arms of his sister
"had seen the nose ring that his sister was wearing and the bracelets on her arms" or "had seen the nose ring and the bracelets that his sister was wearing". Some languages have a specific term for "younger sister" that fits well here. Also see how you translated "nose ring" and "bracelets" in verse 22.

and when he had heard the words of Rebekah his sister saying, 'This is what the man said to me,' 
"and had heard her announce/tell/report what the man {at the well} had said to her," Consider whether it is more natural in your language to use a direct quote or indirect quote here. If you want to make it clear who "the man" refers to, you should still translate it generally, for example, "the man {I met at the well}" because when Rebekah 
said this, she did not yet know who he was. (See: figs-quotations) 

then he went to the man, 
"he went {out} to {where} the man/servant {was}" or "he went {out} to meet him" (See: writing-pronouns)

and behold he was standing 
"and there he was, standing" or "He found/saw him standing". The word "behold" emphasizes what follows it. Consider the best way to do this in your language.

"with {his} camels at/beside the spring/well." or "beside/near the spring/well with {his} camels."


Gen 24:31 Then he said, "Come, blessed of Yahweh. Why are you standing out here? For I have prepared the house and a place for the camels."

Then he said, 
"Then Laban said {to him}," or "Then Laban said {to the man/servant}," Make sure it is clear in your translation that Laban is the one talking here. Consider whether or not to include whom he is speaking to in this quote margin. (See: writing-quotations)

Come, 
"Come {with me}," or "{Please} come {stay with us},"

blessed of Yahweh.
"{you who are} blessed by Yahweh." or "you whom Yahweh has blessed." 

Why are you standing out here? 
"There is no need for you to stand out here." Laban is being polite here, not accusing or critical. For some languages a rhetorical question does not fit here. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-rquestion)

For I have prepared the house 
"I have gotten our house ready {for you and your men to stay with us}" or "because the house is prepared/ready {for you and your men to lodge/stay there}". Consider whether or not it is necessary in your translation to make any implied information explicit in this sentence. (See: figs-explicit)

and a place 
"and {there is also} a place" or "and {we also have} room/space {there}"

for the camels.
"for {your} camels {to stay}." or "where your camels can stay."

Gen 24:32 So the man went to the house. Then he unloaded the camels and gave straw and fodder to the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.

So the man
"Then the man/servant" or "So Abraham's servant" 

went to the house. 
"went/came to Laban's house." or "went/came home {with Laban}." The Hebrew verb can be translated "went" or "came", depending on the perspective that is taken. Do what is most natural in your language. (See: figs-go)

Then he unloaded the camels
"{When they arrived there,} Laban unloaded the camels" or "There Laban took the loads off the camels". The Hebrew text ("he") is ambiguous here, but since Laban was the host it is most likely that he (or some of his servants) took care of the camels for his guests.

and gave straw and fodder to the camels,
"and he gave straw and {other} feed to them {to eat}" or "and fed them straw and {other] fodder/feed". See how you translated "straw and fodder" in verse 25.

and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him.

Make sure your translation does not sound like Abraham's chief servant washed the feet of the other servants who were with him; each person washed off his own feet. See how you translated "wash {the dust off} your feet" in Gen 19:2. (See: figs-explicit)


Gen 24:33 Then food was set before him to eat, but he said, "I will not eat until I have spoken my words." So he said, "Speak."

Then food was set before him to eat, 
"Then they served/brought the servant {and his men} some food," or "After that, {Laban's family} served/provided them a meal to eat," Consider whether it is best in your language to use a passive or active construction here.  (See: figs-activepassive)

but he said,
"but the man/servant said {to them}," or "but the man/servant said {to Laban's family}," (See: writing-quotations)

I will not eat until I have spoken my words.
"I will/must not eat {anything} until I have told you my message." or "Before I will/can eat {anything}, I need to tell {you} why I am here."

So he said,
"So/Then Laban replied," or "Laban responded {to him}," (See: writing-quotations)

Speak.
"{Please} tell {us} {what you have/want to say}." or "{Go ahead and} tell {us} {your message}." Make sure the way you translate this sounds polite. (See: writing-politeness)

a few days, at least ten.
"{for another} ten days or so." or "around ten more days."

After that she will go."
"Then she can go {with you}." or "Then you can go/leave and take her {with you]."


Gen 24:56 But he said to them, "Do not detain me, since Yahweh has made my journey succeed. Send me off so that I will go to my master." 

But he said to them, 
"But the/Abraham's servant said/responded to them," Some languages have a dual pronoun that could be used here. However the servant is probably still addressing the whole family. (See: figs-dual)

Do not detain me, since Yahweh has made my journey succeed. Send me off
"{Please} do not detain/delay me. Since Yahweh has made me successful on my journey, send me/us off" or "{Please} do not detain/delay me, now that Yahweh has given me success on my journey. Let me/us leave". There are two different places where you could begin a new sentence here. Consider what is the most clear and natural way to do this in your language. Also, see how you translated "make my journey succeed" in verse 42.

so that I will go to my master."
"so that I can return {home} to my master."


Gen 24:57 Then they said, "Let's call for the young woman and ask her mouth."

Then they said, 
"So they replied," or "They replied {to him}," (See: writing-quotations)

Let's call for the young woman
"Let's call/summon Rebekah" or "Let's ask Rebekah to come here". Consider again how you translated "young woman" in verses 14-16, 28, 43, 55 and 57, and see the note about this at verse 14. You may need to translate this differently, depending on the context. 

and ask her mouth.
"and ask her to tell us {what she wants to do}." or "and ask her what she wants to do." or "and ask her if she is willing to go now." (See: figs-idiom)

Gen 24:58 So they called for Rebekah and said to her, "Will you go with this man?" And she said, "I will go." 

So they called for Rebekah 
"So they called for her" or "So/Then they summoned her". Consider whether it is better to use a name or a pronoun to refer to Rebekah here in your language, especially considering how you referred to her in verses 53, 55 and 57. (See: writing-pronouns)

and said to her,
"and asked her," (See: writing-quotations)

"Will you go with this man?"
"Are you willing to go {now] with this man?" or "Do you want to go {now} with this man?"

And she said, 
"She answered {them}," (See: writing-quotations)

I will go.
"{Yes,} I will go {now}." or "{Yes,} I am willing to go {now}."


Gen 24:59 Then they sent off Rebekah their sister and her nurse and the servant of Abraham and his men.

Then they sent off Rebekah their sister 
"So they {agreed/decided to} send their sister Rebekah". Notice that Rebekah does not actually leave until verse 61. If this is not clear in your translation, you could include the implied information that they agreed or decided to send her with Abraham's servant. (See: figs-explicit)

and her nurse 
"and her {personal} servant {who had helped raise her}," The term "nurse" refers here to a servant woman who probably nursed Rebekah as a baby, took care of her as she was growing up, and still served her now.

and the servant of Abraham and his men.
"with the servant of Abraham and his men/companions."
    

Gen 24:60 And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, "Our sister, may you become thousands of myriads, and may your offspring possess the gates of those who hate them!"

And they blessed Rebekah and said to her, 
"They blessed Rebekah by saying to her," Make sure your translation of "blessed" and "said" refers to the same event, not two separate events.

"Our sister, 
"{Dear} {little} sister," This is a term of endearment that family members used to refer to Rebekah even though she was not the actual sister of all of them. This practice is common in many cultures. Do what is natural in your language.

may you become
"may you become {the mother/ancestor of}" or "we pray that you will have" or "we pray that God will give you"

thousands of myriads,
"thousands and thousands {of descendants}," or "countless/many thousands {of descendants},"

and may your offspring
"and we pray that your/those descendants will" or "and we pray that God will help them"

possess the gates of those who hate them!"
"conquer the cities of {all} their enemies!" or "conquer/defeat {all} their enemies and rule over them!" See how you translated the phrase "possess the gates" in Gen 22:17. (See: figs-metonymy)


Gen 24:61 Then Rebekah got up and her maids, and they mounted the camels and went with the man. So the servant took Rebekah and left.

Then Rebekah got up and her maids, and they
"Then Rebekah and her maids/servants {who were going with her} got ready {to go} and/then" or "After Rebekah and her maids/servants {who were going with her} packed their things, they" 

mounted the camels 
"got up on the camels {they were going to ride}"

and went with the man.
"and went with Abraham's servant." Consider again how you translated "the man" in verses 21, 22, 26, 29, 30, 32, 61. See the note about this at verse 21. 

So the servant took Rebekah 
"So the/Abraham's servant took Rebekah {with him}" or "So he took her {with him}"

and left.
"and left {to return home}." or "and started the journey {back} home."

Gen 24:62 Meanwhile Isaac came from going to Beer Lahai Roi, and he was living in the land of the Negev.

Meanwhile Isaac came from going to
"Meanwhile Isaac returned {home} from visiting" or "{While they were traveling,} Isaac returned {home} from a trip/visit {he had made} to"

Beer Lahai Roi,
"{the place/well called} Beer Lahai Roi". See how you translated the name of this place in Gen 16:14. (See: translate-names)

and he was living 
"{At that time} he was living" or "and/so he was {back home} where he lived"

in the land of the Negev.
"in the Negev {Wilderness/Desert} region/area." or "in the Negev {Wilderness/Desert}." See how you translated "the land of the Negev" in Gen 20:1, and "the Negev" in Gen 12:9; 13:1, 3.


Gen 24:63 And Isaac went to meditate in the field as it was turning toward evening, and he lifted his eyes and saw that behold, camels were coming.

And Isaac 
"{One day} Isaac/he" or "{After Isaac/he had returned home, one day} he" or "{Sometime after Isaac had returned home,} he". What Isaac does in verse 63 happened sometime after he returned from Beer Lahai Roi, but the Hebrew text does not say exactly when. So introduce this new event in a general way that is not too specific.

went to meditate in the field
"went out in/to the fields/countryside to meditate/pray" or "was meditating/praying out in the fields/countryside"

as it was turning toward evening
"as it was becoming evening/dusk" or "late in the afternoon". For some languages it is more natural to put this time phrase earlier in this sentence and say, for example, "{One day} as it was becoming evening, Isaac/he went" or "One evening, Isaac/he went". Do what is natural in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

and he lifted his eyes
"{As he was praying,} he looked up" (See: figs-idiom)

and saw that behold, 
"and saw {in the distance} that there were" or "and suddenly he saw {in the distance}"
 
camels were coming.
"{some} camels coming/heading {toward him}." or "{some} camels approaching {him}."


Gen 24:64 And Rebekah lifted her eyes and saw Isaac. Then she dismounted from the camel,

And Rebekah lifted her eyes and saw Isaac. 
"Rebekah {also} looked up and saw Isaac."

Then she dismounted 
"Then she {quickly} jumped/got down" or "Immediately she got down"

from the camel,
"from/off the camel {that she was riding}," Consider again how you translated "camel" throughout chapter 24.


Gen 24:65 and she said to the servant, "Who is that man in the field who is coming to meet us?" And the servant said, "He is my master." So she took the veil and covered herself.

and she said to the servant, 
"and asked {Abraham's} servant,"  (See: writing-quotations)

Who is that man in the field who is coming to meet us? 
"Who is that man in the field who is walking {this way} to greet us?" or "Who is that man walking towards us in the field?"

And the servant said, "He is my master." 
The servant answered {her}, "He is my master {Isaac}." Abraham and Isaac were both the servant's masters, especially since Abraham had already given Isaac all of his possessions (verse 36), which included his servants. Consider again how you translated "master/owner" throughout chapter 24.

So she took the veil and covered herself.
"So she took the/her veil and covered her face with it {to show modesty}." or "So she covered herself with a/her veil {to show modesty}." In that culture a bride-to-be wore a large veil to cover her entire body, especially her face, to show modesty and submission to her husband. (See: translate-symaction)

Gen 24:66 Then the servant reported to Isaac all the things that he had done.

Then the servant reported to Isaac 
"Then the servant told Isaac" or "{When they reached Isaac,} the servant told him"

all the things that he had done.
"everything/all that he had done {on/during the journey/trip}."  or "everything/all that had happened {on/during his journey}."


Gen 24:67 Then Isaac brought her into the tent of Sarah his mother, and he took Rebekah, and she became a wife to him. And Isaac loved her and he was comforted after his mother.

Then Isaac brought her 
"Then/So Isaac brought/took Rebekah" 

into the tent of Sarah his mother,
"into the tent where his mother Sarah had lived {before she died}," Make sure your translation of this phrase does not sound like Sarah still lived there; she had died three years previously (Gen 23:1-2).

and he took Rebekah, 
"and he married her,"  (See: figs-idiom)

and she became a wife to him.
"so that she became his wife." 

And Isaac loved her
"Isaac loved her/Rebekah" or "Isaac was/fell in love with her/Rebekah"

and he was comforted 
"and he was consoled {by her}" or "and he was happy again" or "and she made him happy again" (See: figs-activepassive)

after his mother.
"after {mourning for} his mother {who had died}." or "after {the sadness of} his mother's {death}." Make sure it is clear in your translation here why Isaac needed comforting. (See: figs-explicit)
