Gen 9:1 Then God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth. 

Then God blessed Noah and his sons
“Then God showed favor to Noah and his sons” or “Then God caused Noah and his sons to prosper/flourish”. See how you translated “blessed” in Gen 1:22, 28.

and said to them,
“by saying to them,” or “by saying,” or “He said,” The phrase “blessed…and said” is a Hebrew expression that refers to one event and emphasizes it. It does not refer to two separate events. The words of the blessing are in verses 1-7. See how you translated this phrase in Gen 1:28. (See: writing-quotations)

“Be fruitful 
“Bear/Have many children” or “You will bear/have many children” (See: figs-idiom)

and multiply
“so that you {and your descendants} {will} multiply/increase {greatly} {in number}” or “so that you {and your descendants} {will} become {very} numerous/many”. See how you translated “be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth” in Gen 1:28. (See: grammar-connect-logic-goal)

and fill the earth.
“and fill the earth {with people}.” or “and inhabit the whole earth.” or “and live/spread all over the earth/world.”


Gen 9:2 And the fear of you and the dread of you will be on every living thing of the earth, including on every bird of the sky, on everything that moves on the ground, and on all the fish of the sea. Into your hand they are given. 

And the fear of you and the dread of you will be on every living thing of the earth,
“Every living thing/creature on the earth will be afraid and terrified of you,” or “All the animals on earth will be very/terribly afraid of you,” The phrase “the fear...and the dread” repeats the same idea in two different ways to emphasize how afraid the creatures were. For some languages it may be better to combine the phrase and say “very afraid/terrified”. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-doublet)

including on every bird
“including every bird” or “including all the birds”. The birds, moving creatures, and fish are all included in the general category of living creatures. 

of the sky,
“{that flies/fly} in the sky/air,” Consider again how you translated “birds of the sky” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 1:26, 28, 30; 2:19-20; 6:7; 7:3, 23; 9:2.

on everything that moves
“and every creature/animal that moves/lives” or “as well as all creatures/animals that move/live”

on the ground,
“on land,”

and on all the fish of the sea.
“and all the fish in the sea/ocean.”

Into your hand they are given.
“I have put them {all} under your authority.” or “I have put you in charge of them {all}.” The phrase “into your hand” means God was again giving mankind the responsibility to manage and control all the rest of what God had created. Consider whether your language has a similar idiom that would work well here. (See: figs-idiom)


Gen 9:3 Every moving creature that lives will be for you for food. Just as the green plants, I give you everything. 

Every moving creature that lives
“{From now on} every {kind of} living creature/thing that moves” or “{From now on} every creature/animal that is alive and moves”. See how you translated “every moving creature” in Gen 1:26, and see the note about that there. It may be necessary to translate this phrase in different ways in different contexts.

will be for you for food. 
“is yours {to eat} as food.” or “is available for you {to eat} as food.” For some languages it is more natural to change the order of this sentence and say, “You may {now} have/eat any {kind of} living creature that moves, for food.” or “{I now permit} you to eat every/any {kind of} living creature that moves.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

Just as
“Just as {in the past} {I gave/provided you}” or “In the same way that {I previously gave/provided you}”. The Hebrew text leaves the verb implied here. Decide whether or not to make it explicit in your language. (See: figs-ellipsis)

the green plants,
“green plants {for food},” or “plants {to eat},” Consider again how you translated “green plants” in Gen 1:30, and how you translated “plants” in Gen 1:11-12, 29; 2:5; 3:18; 9:3.

I give you everything.
“{now} I give/provide you everything {for food}.” or “{so now} I permit you to eat everything.” or “{so now} I permit you to eat both plants and animals.” Make sure that the way you translate this phrase means that God is now permitting people to eat both plants and animals.


Gen 9:4 But you must not eat flesh with its life, {that is,} its blood.

But
“However,” God is putting a limit on the way that people may eat meat. (See: grammar-connect-exceptions)

you must not eat flesh
“you must never eat {animal} flesh/meat”

with
“that still has”

its life, {that is,} its blood.
“its life {in it}, {which is in} its blood.” or “its blood {in it}, which made it live.” or “its lifeblood {in it}.” Since life is in the blood, God did not want people to eat meat that still had its blood in it, rather he wanted them to drain it out first before they cooked it (also see Deuteronomy 12:16, 23). You could put that information in a footnote.


Gen 9:5 And surely I will demand your blood for your lives. From the hand of every living thing I will demand it, and from the hand of mankind; from the hand of a man {who kills} his brother, I will demand the life of the man. 

And surely I will demand your blood for your lives.
“Also, I will definitely require an accounting/reckoning for your lifeblood.” or “Also, if {one of} you murders anyone, I definitely require that he must die.”

From the hand of every living thing
“From every/any animal {that kills a person}” or “{In fact,} if any animal {kills a human being},” In this verse, the phrase “the hand of” refers to the animal or the person that is responsible for killing someone. (See: figs-synecdoche)

I will demand it,
“I will demand/require its blood/life,” or “I require it to be killed,” or “I demand/require that it must die,”

and from the hand of mankind;
“{That is also true} for human beings:” or “and {that is also true} for human beings.” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

from the hand of a man {who kills}
“If a man/person {kills/murders}” or “If anyone {kills/murders}”

his brother,
“his/a fellow human being,” or “another person,” This phrase is used here as a general reference to any human being, not just biological brothers. (See: figs-synecdoche)

I will demand the life of the man. 
“I require him to be executed/killed.” or “I demand/require that he must die.”


Gen 9:6 The one shedding the blood of a man, by mankind his blood must be shed, because in the image of God he made mankind.

The one 
“{That’s right,} whoever” or “{Yes/Indeed,} if anyone/someone”. The first half of verse 6 repeats and summarizes verse 5.

shedding the blood of
“spills the blood of” or “kills/murders” or “takes the life of”. The phrase “sheds the blood of” is an idiom that means to deliberately kill someone. Blood is an important concept in this passage and throughout the Bible, so if possible it is best to keep this term in a translation. If that is not possible, you should put the literal text in a footnote. (See: figs-idiom) 

a man,
“a person,” or “another human being,” or “someone,” 

by mankind his blood must be shed, 
“people/you must execute him,” or “people/you must put him to death,” or “he must be executed,” For some languages it is more natural to put this clause first in this verse and say, “{That’s right,} you must put to death anyone who murders a human being, because {I,} God, made human beings in my own image.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure) 

because in the image of God he made mankind.
“because {I,} God made/created mankind/people in my {own} image.” or “because I created human beings to be like myself.” Make sure it is clear in your translation that God is referring to himself in this clause. See how you translated a similar clause in Gen 1:27.

Gen 9:7 “And you, be fruitful and multiply. Abound on the earth and multiply on it.”

And you,
“And/Now {as for} you,” or “As for you,” The pronoun “you” is an emphatic pronoun that is fronted here in the Hebrew text to introduce a new topic. Consider what is the best way in your language to begin a new paragraph like this.

be fruitful 
“bear/have many children”. See how you translated “be fruitful and multiply” in verse 1. (See: figs-idiom)

and multiply. 
“so that you {and your descendants} become {very} numerous/many.” or “so that you have many descendants.” 

Abound on the earth
“Spread out all over the earth” or “Live all over the earth”

and multiply
“and multiply/increase {in numbers}” or “and become numerous”

on it.”
“throughout it.” or “everywhere.”

Gen 9:8 Then God said to Noah and to his sons with him, saying, 

Then God said
“Then God continued speaking”

to Noah and to his sons with him, saying,
“to Noah and his sons {who were} with him, and said,” or “to Noah and his sons,” or “to them,” God is still speaking to the same people. This phrase emphasizes what he says next to them. (See: writing-quotations)


Gen 9:9 “And I, behold, I am establishing my covenant with you and with your offspring after you, 

“And I, behold,
“Now listen {carefully} to me:” or “Listen {carefully} to me,” See how you translated “behold” in Gen 1:29, 4:14, 6:13, 17. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.

I am establishing 
“I am making/instituting” or “I am setting up”. See how you translated “establish my covenant with” in Gen 6:18, and see the note about that there.

my covenant with you and with your offspring after you,
“my/a {special/peace} covenant/agreement with you and your offspring/descendants {who come/live} after you,” or “my/a covenant/agreement between me and you and your offspring/descendants,” Notice that the pronouns “you” and “your” are plural throughout verses 2-15, since God is speaking to Noah and his sons.


Gen 9:10 and with every living creature that {is} with you: with the birds, with the livestock, and with every living thing of the earth with you, from all that came out of the ark to every living thing of the earth.

and with 
“along with” or “{It is} also with” or “{The covenant/agreement is} also with”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to break up this long sentence and begin a new sentence here.

every living creature that {is} with you:
“all the living creatures that {are} with you:”

with the birds, with the livestock, 
“including the birds, the livestock,”

and with every living thing of the earth
“and all the {other} living things/creatures from/on the earth” or “and all the wild animals”

with you,
“{that are} with you,”

from all that came out of the ark to 
“{That includes} all {those} that came/went out of the ark and”. The words “from...to...” are used to emphasize that all the animals are included in God’s covenant. Consider what is the best way to express that in your language.

every living thing
“all the living things/creatures” or “all the creatures/animals”

of the earth.
“{that live} on the earth.” or “{that will ever live} on the earth.”


Gen 9:11 And I am establishing my covenant with you that never again will all flesh be cut off by the waters of a flood, and never again will there be a flood to destroy the earth.”

And I am establishing my covenant with you that
“My/The covenant/agreement that I am establishing/making/instituting with you is that”. See how you translated “my covenant” and “establish” in verse 9. (See: translate-key-terms)

never again will all flesh 
“never again will all life” or “never again will all living creatures/things”. The phrase “all flesh” refers here to all people and animals. (See: figs-synecdoche)

be cut off by
“be killed/destroyed by” or “be wiped out by” or “die from” (See: figs-activepassive)

the waters of a flood,
“water from a flood,” or “a flood,” See how you translated a similar phrase in Gen 7:10.

 and never again will there be a flood
“That’s right, never again will {I use/cause} a flood” or “{I promise that} I will never again use/cause a flood”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

to destroy 
“that destroys”. See how you translated “destroying” in Gen 6:13.

“{life/everything on} the earth.” or “{all living creatures on} the earth.” This phrase  refers here to everything that lives on the earth. (See: figs-metonymy)

Gen 9:12 Then God said, “This {is} the sign of the covenant that I am making between me and you and every living creature that {is} with you, for generations forever: 

Then God said, 
“Then God {also} said {to them},” or “Then God added/continued,” or “Then God continued talking/speaking {to Noah and his sons},” God is still talking to the same people, but a quote margin (“Then God said”) is added here to emphasize the new topic (“the sign of the covenant”). For some languages it is more natural to leave this quote margin implied and just have a paragraph break. See what you did for a similar case in verse 8. (See: writing-quotations)

“This {is} the sign of the covenant that I am making 
“This {is} the sign {which shows} {that I promise to always keep} the covenant/agreement that I am making/establishing” or “This is how I will show/remind {everyone} that I have made/established this covenant/agreement”

between me and you and every living creature that {is} with you,
“with you and with all the living creatures that {are} with you,”

for generations forever: 
“for all future generations:” or “and with all generations to come:” or “as well as with all the people and creatures/animals that will ever live:”


Gen 9:13 I have set my rainbow in the clouds, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and the earth.” 

I have set my rainbow
“I have/will put my rainbow” or “I am setting/putting/placing my rainbow”

in the clouds,
“among the clouds {in the sky},”

and it will be the sign 
“where it will show/remind {everyone}” or “to show/remind {everyone}” or “and/where it will serve/function as the sign {which shows}”. See how you translated “the sign of the covenant” in verse 12.

“{every living thing on} the earth.” or “{every creature that lives on} the earth.” This phrase refers here to mankind and all the animals. See how you translated the same phrase in verse 11. (See: figs-metonymy)


Gen 9:14 And it will be when I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow is seen in the clouds, 

And it will be when
“So it will be/happen {that} whenever” or “So whenever” or “Whenever”

I bring clouds
“I bring/gather clouds {together}” or “I cause clouds to form/appear”

over the earth
“{in the sky} over/above the earth”

and the rainbow is seen
“and the/a rainbow appears/forms” or “and you see the/a rainbow”. Consider whether it is better in your language to use a passive or active verb here. (See: figs-activepassive)

in the clouds,
“among the clouds,”


Gen 9:15 then I will remember my covenant that {is} between me and you and every living creature of all flesh, and never again will waters become a flood to destroy all flesh. 

then I will remember my covenant
“then I will remember {and keep} my/the covenant/agreement” or “then I will not forget {to keep/fulfill} my/the covenant/treaty”. See how you translated “remember” in Gen 8:1. It may need to be translated differently in different contexts. (See: figs-idiom)

that {is} between me and you
“that {I have established/made} between me and you” or “that I have established/made with you”

and every living creature of all flesh,
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) “and all living creatures of every kind,” or “and all the animals, including all the different kinds,” (2) “and all {other} living creatures, including all people and animals,”

and never again will waters become a flood to destroy
“that never again will there be a flood that destroys” or “{I promise/vow/pledge} that never again will I use/cause a flood to destroy”. Make sure it is clear in your translation that this last clause in verse 15 is what God promised in his covenant. Also, consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

“all life.” or “all living creatures.” or “all people and animals.”


Gen 9:16 So the rainbow will be in the clouds, and I will see it to remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature, with all flesh that {is} on the earth.”

So
“So/Yes, whenever” or “{That is how it will be:} Whenever”. In verse 16, God repeats and emphasizes what he said in verses 12-15.

the rainbow will be
“the/a rainbow appears/forms” or “there is a rainbow”

in the clouds, 
“among the clouds,” See how you translated this phrase in verses 13 and 14.

and I will see it 
“I will see it” or “I will look at it”

Gen 9:17 Then God said to Noah, “That {is} the sign of the covenant that I have established between me and all flesh that {is} on the earth.”

Then God said to Noah, 
“Finally, God said to Noah,” or “Then God {concluded/finished} by saying to Noah,” (See: writing-quotations)

“That {is}

“the sign {which shows} {that I promise to always keep} the covenant/agreement that I am establishing/making” or “how I will show/remind {everyone} that I have established/made/instituted this covenant/agreement/treaty”. See how you translated a similar clause in verse 12. In that verse God is explaining the rainbow for the first time, whereas here in verse 17, he is pointing back to what he just said about the rainbow in order to emphasize its importance. Also, consider again how you translated “covenant” in verses 9, 11-13, 15-17. (See: translate-key-terms)

“with”

all flesh that {is} on the earth.”
“all living creatures/things.” or “all the people and animals that {are/live} on the earth.” Consider again how you translated “all flesh” when it includes people and animals. See Gen 6:12-13, 17; 7:21; 9:11, 15-17. It may be necessary to translate this phrase in different ways in different contexts.


9:18-29 Noah And His Three Sons After The Flood

Gen 9:18 And the sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem and Ham and Japheth; and Ham, he {was} the father of Canaan. 

And the sons of Noah
“Noah’s sons” or “{The names of} Noah’s sons”

who came out of
“who went out of/from” or “who disembarked from” or “who got off”. See how you translated a similar phrase in verse 10. (See: figs-go)

“the ark/boat {after the flood}”. Be consistent here with how you translated this term in chapters 6-8, and see the note at Gen 6:14. 

were Shem and Ham and Japheth; 
“were Shem, Ham, and Japheth;” Consider what is the best way to list names in your language. 

and Ham, he 
“it was Ham who” or “Ham was the one who”. The pronoun “he” is emphatic here, emphasizing that Ham was the father of Canaan, who is probably mentioned here because he was well known as the ancestor of the Canaanites and the one whom the land/region of Canaan was named after.

{was} the father of Canaan.
“was Canaan’s father.” or “fathered Canaan.”


Gen 9:19 Those three {were} the sons of Noah, and from them the whole earth was overspread.

Those three {were} the sons of Noah, and from them the whole earth was overspread.
“It was from Noah’s three sons that the entire earth was populated {again}.” or “It was the descendants of Noah’s three sons who populated the entire earth {again}.” (See: figs-active passive)

Gen 9:20 Now Noah, a man of the soil, began and planted a vineyard. 

Now Noah,
“Now {later on,} Noah,” or “After a while, Noah,” or “Noah,” Consider what is the best way in your language to introduce or begin a new episode here. (See: writing-newevent)

a man of the soil, began and planted 
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) “{who was} a farmer, began/started {farming} and planted” or “{who was} a farmer, was the first {man/person} to plant” (2) “began {to be} a farmer” or “became a farmer and planted”

a vineyard.
“{some} grapevines {and made wine from the grapes}.” or “a field/garden with grapevines. {And he made wine from the grapes.}” It is implied that Noah made wine from the grapes (verse 21). If necessary, you could make that explicit here. Also, if grapes are not known in your language area, you could say “vines/plants with a fruit called grapes”, or you could put in a footnote information about grapes, including how they are squeezed and how the juice is fermented to make wine. (See: figs-explicit)


Gen 9:21 Then he drank some of the wine, and he became drunk, and he uncovered himself inside his tent. 

Then 
“Then {one day}” 

he drank some of the wine,
“he drank {too much of} the wine,” or “he drank a lot of the wine,”

and he became drunk, and he
“so that he got drunk and” or “so that he became so intoxicated/drunk that he”

uncovered himself 
“{fell asleep and} became uncovered/exposed” or “{fell asleep} uncovered/naked”. It is implied from verse 24 that Noah had fallen asleep. (See: figs-explicit)

inside his tent.
See how you translated “tent” in Gen 4:20.


Gen 9:22 Then Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his father, and he told his two brothers outside. 

Then Ham, the father of Canaan,
“Ham, {who was} Canaan’s father,”

saw the nakedness of his father, 
“saw that his father was naked/uncovered,”

and he told his two brothers outside.
“and he went outside and told his two brothers {about it}.” or “and he went out and told his two brothers {that their father was drunk and naked}.”


Gen 9:23 But Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it across the shoulders of the two of them and walked backward and covered the nakedness of their father. And their faces were turned away, so that they did not see the nakedness of their father.

But Shem and Japheth
“However/Then Shem and Japheth”

took a garment,
“took a robe/cloak,” This garment would have probably been fairly large, big enough to cover Noah’s body.

and laid it across the shoulders of the two of them
“put it {between them} over their shoulders” or “held it {between them} at shoulder level”

and walked backward 
“and walked/went backward {into the tent}”

and covered the nakedness of their father. 
“and covered their father’s naked body {with it}.” or “and used it to cover their naked father.”

And their faces were turned away, 
“{As they did that,} they kept their faces/eyes turned/looking away {from him},” or “{As they did that,} they looked away {from him},”

so that they did not see 
“so that they would not see”

the nakedness of their father.
“his nakedness.” or “him naked.” Consider whether it is better here in your language to refer to Noah with a noun phrase or a pronoun. (See: writing-pronouns)

Gen 9:24 Then Noah woke up from his wine, and he learned what his youngest son had done to him, 

Then Noah 
“Later Noah/he”

woke up from his wine,
“woke up {sober} from {the effects of} the wine,” or “woke up from being drunk,” or “woke up sober,”

and he learned
“and he found out” or “and he heard {about}”. The text does not say how Noah found out about this, so it is best to not be too specific about that here in your translation.

what his youngest son had done to him,
“that his youngest son {Ham} had dishonored/disrespected/mocked him,”


Gen 9:25 and he said, “Cursed be Canaan! He will be a slave of slaves for his brothers.”

and he said
“So he exclaimed {about him/Ham},” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. (See: writing-quotations)

“Cursed be
“I {hereby} {ask God to} curse” or “May God curse”

Canaan!
“{Ham’s son} Canaan!” In verses 25-27, Canaan probably represents Ham and all of Ham’s descendants (the Canaanites), who will serve Shem and Japheth and all their descendants. You could put that information in a footnote.

He will be
“Canaan will be” or “{I declare/proclaim that} he/Canaan will be”

a slave of slaves
“the lowest slave/servant”. The Hebrew word here can mean either “slave” or “servant”. Slaves in the Old Testament were usually treated well and were not much different than servants, sometimes even becoming like members of their owner’s family. But they were of lower status than their masters, so that is part of how Ham’s family is being cursed.

for his brothers.”
“for his/Canaan’s relatives.” Verses 26 and 27 show that “his brothers” probably refers here to Shem and Japheth (who were Canaan’s uncles) and their descendants. 
 

Gen 9:26 Then he said, “Praised be Yahweh, the God of Shem! And may Canaan be a slave for him. 

Then he said,
“Then he/Noah {also} said,” or “He/Noah also said,” (See: writing-pronouns)

“Praised be Yahweh,
“Praise Yahweh,” or “I praise Yahweh,” Although many English translations have “Blessed be” here instead of “Praised be,” the word used in the Hebrew text means “praise” when people are acting towards God (as here), and it means “bless” when God is acting towards people (as in Gen 1:28; 5:2; 9:1). (See: translate-key-terms)

 the God of Shem!
“{who is} Shem’s God!” or “{who is} the God whom Shem worships/serves!” or “{who is} the God who takes care of Shem!”

 And may Canaan be 
“May he/God cause Canaan to be” or “May he/God make Canaan” or “I ask him/God to make Canaan”

a slave for him.
“a servant for him/Shem.” or “his/Shem’s slave/servant.” 


Gen 9:27 May God enlarge Japheth, and may he live in the tents of Shem. And may Canaan be a slave for him.”

May God
“I {also} ask God to” or “I {also} pray that God will”
 
enlarge Japheth,
“enlarge/expand Japheth’s {territory},” or “make Japheth’s territory larger,” or “give Japheth more/much land,” (See: figs-metonymy)

and may he live 
“and enable him {and his family/descendants} to live”

in the tents of Shem. 
“together {in harmony/peace} with Shem {and his family/descendants}.” or “peacefully among Shem {and his family/descendants}.”

And may Canaan be 
“May God {also} cause Canaan to be” or “I {also} ask God to make Canaan” or “Canaan will {also} be”. See how you translated a similar sentence in verse 26.

“a servant for him/Japheth.” or “his/Japheth’s slave/servant.” Compare how you translated “slave” or “servant” in verses 25-27.

Gen 9:28 And after the flood, Noah lived 350 years. 

And after the flood,
“After/From {the time that} the flood {began},” or “After/From {the beginning of} the flood,” Notice that this phrase refers to when the flood began, when Noah was 600 years old (Gen 7:6), not when it ended a year later, when he was 601 years old (8:13), since he was 950 when he died (verse 29), not 951. (See: figs-explicit)

Noah lived 350 years.
“Noah lived {another} 350 years.” or “Noah lived 350 {more} years.”
