1:1-2:3 How God Created Everything

Gen 1:1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.

In the beginning
“At the beginning {of time/everything}” or “{Everything} began when”. Many Bible scholars think that verse one records God’s first act in creating the universe. This is also the traditional, historically-held view and fits with the narrative structure of the Hebrew text, as well as the wider context of Scriptures which states that God created everything out of nothing at the very beginning of the world (Psalm 33:6, 9; Hebrews 11:3). See the chapter introduction for more details about different interpretations of Genesis 1:1. Also, some languages must use a verb (“began”) in verse 1 rather than a noun (“beginning”). Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-abstractnouns)

God
Translate the title “God” in a way that refers to the Supreme Being who created everything, who has complete power, who knows everything and is present everywhere. He is the only true God and has always existed. (See: translate-key-terms)

created
“made”. In the Hebrew Bible, the verb “create” refers to an activity that only God does, and it often implies (as it does here) that he made something out of nothing. Also, the forms of the verbs in the Hebrew text (and the conjunctions) show that chapter one is a narrative that tells about true history and events in the order that things actually happened. Make sure that your translation does the same thing. (See: translate-key-terms)

the heavens
“the sky”. This phrase refers here to the region where all the stars and planets would later exist. Keep that in mind as you translate this term. (See: translate-key-terms)

and the earth.
This phrase refers to the planet earth. (See: translate-key-terms)


Gen 1:2 Now the earth was formless and empty, and darkness {was} over the surface of the deep {waters}, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters. 

Now the earth
“Now {at first after that,} the earth” or “{At first after that,} the earth”. The author pauses here to describe what the earth was like after God first created it (verse 1). Some languages use a conjunction like “Now” to introduce that information; other languages do not use a conjunction here. Do what is natural in your language. Also, be consistent here with how you translated “the earth” in verse 1.

was formless and empty,
It is not clear what the earth looked like at that time, but it did not have its present shape and order. Also, the Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) “was formless/shapeless and empty/desolate,” or “did not have {its present} form, and there was nothing {living} on it {yet},” (2) “completely empty/desolate,” which is a hendiadys. However it is best to keep both terms separate in your translation (as in the first interpretation). 

and darkness {was} over the surface of the deep {waters},
“It was {totally/completely} dark, there was deep {water} {everywhere},” or “There was deep {water} {everywhere} {that was covered/surrounded} in/by {complete/total} darkness,” For some languages it is more natural to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language.

and the Spirit of God was hovering
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) “and God’s Spirit was hovering/moving” (2) “and a wind from God was blowing” (3) “and a powerful wind was blowing”. The first interpretation is most likely, since the Hebrew verb “hovering” does not describe what wind does.

over the surface of the waters.
“over the surface of the water.” or “above the waters/water.” Throughout this chapter, the word “waters” is in the plural in the Hebrew text. For some languages it is more natural to use the singular “water”. Do what is best in your language in each context.


Gen 1:3 Then God said, “Let there be light.” And there was light.

Then God said,	
“Then God commanded,” What God says in verse 3 is a command. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to make that explicit in this quote margin. (See: writing-quotations)

“Let there be light.”
“Let light exist.” or “I command there to be light.” or “I command light to start shining!” This is a command, not permission or a suggestion. It is a direct quote of what God actually said, and it is usually put between quotation marks in a translation. If you use an exclamation mark with this command in your translation, make sure it does not mean or imply that God was angry. Also, the way you translate “light” should refer to what shines from a source of light; it does not refer here to the source itself.

And there was light.
“And/So {immediately} there was light.” or “And {so/immediately} light started shining.” Light began to shine immediately as a result of God’s command.


Gen 1:4 And God saw the light, that {it was} good. Then God separated between the light and the darkness.

And God saw
“And he saw/observed” or “God/He saw/observed”. Notice that Hebrew frequently uses a conjunction such as “And” or “Then” at the beginning of a sentence. Some languages do not use conjunctions as frequently as Hebrew does. Do what is accurate and natural in your language in each context. (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)

the light, that {it was} good.
“that the light {was} good/excellent.” In the Bible, “good” is an important theme. Throughout chapter one, it especially means that what God created was high quality, complete, and had no defects; in other words, it had all the characteristics and functions that God intended it to have. It also includes the idea that what God created was untainted by sin and reflected his good character (Psalm 19:1; Romans 1:20). The focus here is not on how pleased or satisfied God was. (See: translate-key-terms)

Then God
“Then he”. In order to produce an accurate and natural translation, it is important in each context to make sure that nouns (such as “God”) and pronouns (such as “he”) are used properly in your language. In the Hebrew text, “God” is repeated frequently in chapter one to emphasize him and show that he is in focus. For some languages it is more natural to say “God” only once at the beginning of each paragraph or section, and then use pronouns to refer to him the rest of the time (or most of the time). Throughout chapter one, do what is best in your language each time that God is referred to. (See: writing-pronouns)

separated between the light and the darkness.
“separated/divided the light from the darkness {so that each had its own time}.” or “caused the light to have its own time and the darkness to have its own time.” or “separated the light from the darkness {so that it would be light for a number of hours, and then dark for a number of hours}.”

   
Gen 1:5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. Then there was evening, and there was morning, one day.

And God called
“Then God/he called/named” or “God/He called/named”. Some languages omit the connecting word “And” or “Then” here. Consider the best way in your language to connect this sentence with the previous one. (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)

the light Day,
“the light Daytime.” Notice that in this context the word “Day” refers only to the time when the sun is shining, not to the 24-hour time period that makes up a complete day. Make sure that this is clear in your translation. Throughout chapter one, some translations use quote marks around the names that God gives the different things he created.

and the darkness he called Night.
“and the darkness he called/named Nighttime.” or “and he called/named the darkness Nighttime.” In the Hebrew text, “the darkness” is first in this clause to emphasize the contrast between the light and the darkness. Consider the best way to translate this clause in your language.

Then there was evening, and there was morning,
“Then evening came and {then/later} morning came,” The evening and the morning are the parts of a 24-hour day that separate the hours of daytime (light) from the hours of nighttime (darkness): Evening came at the end of each daytime after God finished his work of creating. Then after about 12 hours of nighttime, morning came, which began the next 12 hours of daytime when God did more work. Make sure your translation does not sound like morning came immediately after evening. Some languages have a one-word conjunction that means “and then” or “and later” that fits well here. (See: grammar-connect-time-sequential)
   
one day.
“{and that was} day one.” or “{and that was} {the end of} the first day.” Here “day” refers to a full 24-hour day. Also, the Hebrew text uses a cardinal number (“one”) here, but then uses ordinal numbers (“second”, “third”, and so on) for the rest of the days of creation week. Some languages need to use an ordinal number (“first”) here too. Other languages use cardinal numbers throughout (“day one”, “day two”, and so on). Do what is best in your language. (See: translate-ordinal)

Gen 1:6 Then God said, “Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.”

Then God said,
“Then God commanded,” See how you translated this phrase in verse 3. (See: writing-quotations)
   
“Let there be an expanse
“Let there be a large/vast space” or “I command there to be a {large/vast} expanse/space” or “I command a large/vast space to form/exist”. The Hebrew word for “expanse” here describes a large space that is “spread out.” It was not solid, rather it was open and empty and could be seen through and flown through (verse 20). It was probably also curved, following the spherical shape of the earth. See how you translated “Let there be” in verse 3.

in the middle of the waters,
“in the middle of the water,” See how you translated “waters” in verse 2.
   
and let it separate the waters from the waters.”
“and let it separate/divide the water {above it} from the water {below it}.” or “so that it separates/divides the waters/water into two separate/different places.”


Gen 1:7 So God made the expanse and separated between the waters that {were} under the expanse and the waters that {were} above the expanse. And it was so.

So God made
“In that way God/he made/created” or “That is how God/he made/created”. Verse 7 explains what God’s command in verse 6 caused to happen, and it repeats some of the same words and phrases. Make sure that your translation of these verses does not sound like God created the expanse twice.

the expanse 
“a large/vast space”

and separated
“and divided” or “and used it to separate/divide”

between the waters that {were} under the expanse and the waters that {were} above the expanse.
“the water that {was} below the expanse/space from the water that {was} above it.” or “the water that {was} under/below it from the water that {was} above it.” For some languages it is more natural to use a pronoun (“it”) here to refer to the expanse, since it was just mentioned earlier in the verse. Each language has its own system of when to use nouns or pronouns to refer to people, places and things. In each context, do what is clear and natural in your language. (See: writing-pronouns)

And it was so.
“That is the way it happened.” or “Everything was/happened {exactly} as he commanded {it to be/happen}.” (See: figs-explicit)


Gen 1:8 And God called the expanse Heavens. Then there was evening, and there was morning, the second day. 

And God called
“and God/he called/named” or “God/He called/named”. Consider whether it is more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here (with or without a conjunction), or to continue the sentence that began at the end of verse 7. Also see how you translated this phrase in verse 5. (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)

the expanse
“the large/vast space”. See how you translated this phrase in verses 6 and 7.
   
Heavens.
“Sky.” This word probably refers here to the atmosphere above the earth’s surface where clouds are and where birds fly, as well as the space where the sun, moon, and stars are now. See how you translated this term in verse 1. (See: translate-key-terms)

Then there was evening, and there was morning,
“Then evening came and {then/later} morning came,” See how you translated this sentence in verse 5, and see the note about that there.
   
the second day.
“{and that was} {the end of} the second day.” or “{and} the second day ended.” or “{and that was} {the end of} day two.” Consider whether it is more natural in your language to use an ordinal number (“second”) here or a cardinal number (“two”). (See: translate-ordinal)

__________________________Paragraph Break________________________________

Gen 1:9 Then God said, “Let the waters under the heavens be gathered to one place, and let the dry ground appear.” And it was so.
   
Then God said,
“Then God commanded,” See how you translated this phrase in verses 3 and 6. (See: writing-quotations)

“Let the waters under the heavens be gathered
“Let the water {that is} under the heavens/sky gather/come together” or “I command the water {that is} below the heavens/sky to gather/come together”. Consider whether it is better here in your language to use a passive form of the verb (“be gathered”) or an active form (“gather” or “come”). (See: figs-activepassive)

to one place,
“in one place/area” or “into one area”

and let the dry ground appear.”
“so that there is dry ground/land.” or “so that dry ground/land can be seen.” or “so that land is uncovered and dries off.” The water had been covering the land, so when the water receded from it, the land became exposed and dried off. Make sure that the way you translate “dry ground” does not sound like the land was dry while it was under the water.
   
And it was so.
“And that is {exactly} what happened.” or “And it was/happened {exactly} as God commanded {it to be/happen}.” See how you translated this sentence in verse 7. It may be necessary to translate it in different ways, depending on the context.
   

Gen 1:10 And God called the dry ground Land, and the gathered waters he called Seas. And God saw that {it was} good.

And God called 
“Then God/he called/named”

the dry ground
“the dry land” or “the ground/land that had dried off”

Land,
“Ground,” This is the same Hebrew word that is translated as “earth” in verse 1, but here it refers to the dry land or ground (in contrast to the water), not the entire planet.

and the gathered waters he called
“and the waters/water that he had gathered together he called/named” or “and he called/named the gathered waters” or “and he called/named the waters/water that had gathered/come together”. See how you translated a sentence in verse 5 that is similar in structure to this sentence. (See: figs-infostructure)

Seas.
“Oceans.” or “Sea/Ocean.” At that time there was probably just one very large body of water and one very large land mass on the earth (as verse 9 indicates). So a singular noun that refers to the largest body of water, such as “Ocean” or “Sea”, could be used here in your translation.

And God saw 
“And he saw/observed” or “God/He saw/observed”. Decide whether it is more natural in your language to use a noun (“God”) or a pronoun (“he”) in this context. See how you translated this phrase in verse 4. (See: writing-pronouns)

that {it was} good.
“that {what he had made was} good/excellent.” or “that {the land and the seas/ocean were} good/excellent.” Some languages cannot use a pronoun (“it”) here, but have to specify what was good. Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated the word “good” in verse 4, and see the note about that there.

Gen 1:11 Then God said, “Let the land sprout vegetation: {every} plant yielding seed, {every} fruit tree bearing fruit according to its kind, that {has} its seed inside it, on the earth.” And it was so.

Then God said,
“Then God commanded,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Let the land
“I command the land/ground to” or “The land/ground must now”. Notice that when God commands the land to do something, it obeys him. See how you translated “Land” in verse 10.

sprout vegetation:
“grow/produce {green} plants,” or “be covered with {green} plants,” The Hebrew word for “vegetation” refers generally here to any kind of green plant and includes the plants and trees that are mentioned next in this verse.

{every} plant yielding seed,
“{including} {every kind/type of} plant that produces/has seeds” or “{including} {all kinds/types of} plants that produce/have seeds”. This phrase refers to many different kinds of plants, not just one plant or one seed. Make sure that is clear in your translation. Also, these kinds of plants have soft stems and include vegetable plants, herbs and other plants that produce edible seeds, such as rice, corn and wheat.

{every} fruit tree bearing fruit according to its kind,
“{and} fruit trees that bear/produce fruit, {each} according to its {own} kind/type,” or “{and} {every kind/type of} fruit tree that bears/produces/has its own kind/type of fruit” or “{and} {all kinds/types of} fruit trees that bear/produce/have their own kind/type of fruit”. The phrase “according to its kind” emphasizes that each different kind of tree produces its own kind of fruit and seeds, which grow and become only that kind of tree. For example, apple trees always produce apples with apple seeds, never peaches or cherries, or any other kind of fruit or seeds.

that {has} its seed inside it,
“that {has} seeds inside,” or “with seeds inside,” or “with its {own kind/type of} seeds inside it,” 

on the earth.”
“throughout the earth.” or “all over the earth.” For some languages it is clearer and more natural to put this phrase earlier in this verse and say, “Let the land sprout vegetation on/throughout the earth...” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

And it was so.
“And that is {exactly} what happened:” or “And it/everything happened {exactly} as God commanded {it to happen}:” Either a period or a colon can be used here, but a colon more clearly shows that verse 12 gives the details of what happened. This is different from verse 7 where the details of what happened come before “And it was so”, and from verse 9 where no additional details are given.


Gen 1:12 So the land brought out vegetation: {every} plant yielding seed according to its kind, and {every} tree bearing fruit that {has} its seed inside it, according to its kind. And God saw that {it was} good.

So the land brought out vegetation:
“The land sprouted/produced vegetation/plants,” or “The land started growing/producing {green} plants,” Verse 12 explains what God’s command in verse 11 caused to happen, and it repeats some of the same words and phrases. Make sure that your translation of these verses does not sound like God created the plants twice.
	
{every} plant yielding seed according to its kind,
“{including} plants that produce/have seeds, {each} according to its {own} kind/type,” or “{including} {every kind/type of} plant that produces/has seeds that grow into the same kind/type of plant,” or “{including} {all kinds/types of} plants that produce/have their own kind/type of seeds,”

and {every} tree bearing fruit that {has} its seed inside it, according to its kind.
“and trees that bear/produce fruit with seeds inside, {each} according to its {own} kind.” or “and {every kind/type of} tree that produces/has fruit with seeds that grow into the same kind/type of tree.” or “and {all kinds/types of} trees that {produce/have} their own kind/type of seed-bearing fruit.”

And God saw
“And he saw/observed” or “God/He saw/observed”. Consider whether or not it is more natural in your language to begin this sentence with a conjunction. (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)

that {it was} good.
“that {what he had made/created was} good/excellent.” or “that {all the plants and trees were} good/excellent.” See how you translated this clause in verse 10. Some languages have to specify what was good. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-explicit)


Gen 1:13 Then there was evening, and there was morning, the third day.
 
Then there was evening, and there was morning,
“Then evening came and {then/later} morning came,” See how you translated this sentence in verses 5 and 8.

the third day.
“{and that was} {the end of} the third day.” or “{and} the third day {ended}.” or “{and that was} {the end of} day three.” (See: translate-ordinal)

Gen 1:14 Then God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate between the day and the night. And let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years.

Then God said, 
“Then God commanded,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Let there be lights 
“Let lights/lamps appear/exist” or “I command there to be sources of light” or “Let there be things/objects that give/shine light”. These lights refer to the sun, moon and stars that give off light. But it is important to keep this general in your translation (like the Hebrew text does) and not specify the names of these lights.

in the expanse of the heavens
“in the expanse/space of/called the heavens/sky” or “in the open space of the heavens/sky” or “in the heavens/sky”. The expanse is the same thing as the heavens (verse 8), so some translations leave “the expanse of” implied here. Do what is best in your language. 

to separate
“to divide/distinguish” or “that separate/divide”

between the day and the night.
“the day{time} from the night{time}.” See how you translated “Day{time}” and “Night{time}” in verse 5.

And let them be for 
“Let those lights/lamps also be” or “They must/will also serve/function as” or “I also command those lights/lamps to serve/function as” 

signs, and for 
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) “signs/markers {of special/important events}, and {they must/will} mark” or “mark/indicate when important things happen, and {they must/will} mark” (2) “signs/markers that mark/indicate/show”. The word “signs” means that the lights can mark certain times of the year. Following the first interpretation, the lights are to also mark special events (such as the star that signaled Jesus’ birth and the darkened sun at Jesus’ death). 

seasons, and for days and years.
“seasons, days and years.” or “when seasons, days and years begin {and end}.” The sun and moon show the passing of time. For example, the 30-day month is determined by the phases of the moon, and the 365-day year is determined by the time it takes for the earth to travel around the sun. Seasons are regular times of the year, such as seed-planting and harvesting times, and the seasons of spring, summer, fall and winter (Genesis 8:22), as well as the special festivals which God appointed for his people to meet with him. You could put some of that information in a footnote.
   

Gen 1:15 And let them be as lights in the expanse of the heavens to shine on the earth.” And it was so.

And let them be as
“And they must/will be” or “They must/will serve/function as” or “Their purpose is to serve/function as”

lights
“sources of light”
   
in the expanse of the heavens
“in the expanse/space called the heavens/sky” or “in the open space of the heavens/sky” or “in the heavens/sky”. See how you translated this phrase in verse 14.

to shine on the earth.”
“to/that shine {light} on the earth.” or “so that they provide/give light to/for the earth.” See how you translated “the earth” in verses 1-2.
   
And it was so.
“And that is {exactly} what happened.” or “And it was/happened {exactly} as he commanded {it to be/happen}.”


Gen 1:16 So God made the two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night, and the stars.

So God made
“In that way God/he made/created” or “That is how God/he made/created”. Verses 16-18 explain what God’s commands in verses 14-15 caused to happen. Make sure your translation of these verses does not sound like he created the lights twice. See how you translated “So God made” in verse 7.
   
the two great lights,
“the two bright/big lights,” This phrase refers to the sun and the moon, which are the two brightest objects in the earth’s sky. However the author intentionally does not use their names, so you should not include their names in your translation either.

the greater light 
“the stronger/brighter light”. The focus is on the relative brightness or strength of the lights, not on their size.

to rule the day, 
“to dominate/govern the day,” or “to shine during the day,” The word “rule” is a figure of speech that means each light has the greatest effect during a particular time period because it is the brightest light that is shining then. For some languages, nonliving objects like the sun and the moon cannot “rule” because only people can do that. Do what is accurate and natural in your language. (See: figs-personification)

and the lesser light 
“and the weaker/dimmer light”

to rule the night,
“to dominate/govern the night,” or “to shine during the night,” Be consistent here with how you translated “rule” previously in this verse.

and the stars.
“and {he also made/created} the stars.” or “{That is} also {when he made/created} the stars.” The verb “made” that is used earlier in the verse is implied here. Translate this in a way that is clear and natural in your language. (See: figs-ellipsis)


Gen 1:17 And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to shine on the earth,

And God 
“God/He”. Consider the best way in your language to refer to God in this context. (See: writing-pronouns)

set them
“placed/put them” or “placed/put the lights”. Consider the best way in your language to refer to the lights in this context. (See: writing-pronouns)

in the expanse of the heavens
“in the expanse/space called the heavens/sky” or “in the open space of the heavens/sky” or “in the heavens/sky”. See how you translated this phrase in verses 14 and 15. 

to shine on the earth,
“to shine light on the earth,” or “to provide/give light to/for the earth,” See how you translated this phrase in verse 15.


Gen 1:18 and to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate between the light and the darkness. And God saw that {it was} good.

and to rule over the day and over the night,
“and to govern/dominate the day{time} and/or the night{time},” or “and to shine during the day{time} and/or during the night{time},” Make sure that your translation of the word “day” refers here to the daytime hours, not an entire 24-hour day. Also see how you translated “rule” in 1:16. (See: figs-personification)

and to separate between the light and the darkness.
“and to divide/distinguish the light from the darkness.” or “and to separate/distinguish the time of light from the time of darkness.” Consider again how you translated “separate” in verses 4, 6-7, 14 and 18.

And God saw 
“And he saw/observed” or “God/He saw/observed”

that {it was} good.
“that {what he had made/created was} good/excellent.” or “that {the lights in the heavens/sky were} good/excellent.” Some languages need to specify what was good. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-explicit)


Gen 1:19 Then there was evening, and there was morning, the fourth day.

Then there was evening, and there was morning,
“Then evening came and {then/later} morning came,”

Gen 1:20 Then God said, “Let the waters swarm {with} swarm{s} of living creature{s}, and let bird{s} fly above the earth across the face of the expanse of the sky.”

Then God said,
“Then God commanded,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Let the waters swarm {with} swarm{s} of living creature{s},
“I command the water to be full of large numbers/groups of living creatures,” or “I command there to be large numbers/groups of {water} animals that live everywhere in the water,” 

and let bird{s} fly
“and let there be birds that fly” or “I also command there to be birds that fly” or “Also let there be winged creatures that fly”. The Hebrew word for “birds” can also be more general and refer to “winged/flying creatures,” which includes birds, bats, flying insects and even flying reptiles that are now extinct. Consider whether it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

above the earth across the face of the expanse of the sky.”
“above the earth, through the sky/air.” or “across/in/through the sky above the earth.”


Gen 1:21 So God created the great sea creatures and every living creature that moves which the waters swarm with according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that {it was} good.

So God created
“That is how God/he created/made” or “In that way God/he created/made”. See how you translated “created” in verse 1. (See: writing-pronouns)

the great sea creatures
“the huge/gigantic sea/ocean animals”. These include whales, sharks, giant squid, crocodiles, and leviathans (Psalm 74:13-14, Isaiah 27:1), which were probably swimming reptiles that are now extinct.
 
and every living creature that moves
“and every {kind/type of fish and every other} creature/animal that moves/lives” or “and all the {fish and other} {kinds/types of} creatures/animals that move/live”

which the waters swarm with
“throughout the water/ocean in large numbers/groups,” or “in the water and fills it,” or “all over the place in the water/ocean,”

according to their kind,
“{each} according to its {own} kind/type,” or “{each} that produces/has its own kind/type {of offspring/young},” This phrase emphasizes that each different kind of creature has its own distinct kind of offspring/young. For example, whales always give birth to whales, and never give birth to cats or cows, or any other kind of creature.

and
“and {how he created/made}” or “{That is} also {how he created/made}”. For some languages it is more natural to begin a new sentence here, so that the previous sentence is not too long. Do what is best in your language.

every winged bird
“every {kind/type of} bird” or “all {the different kinds/types of} birds” or “every {kind/type of} winged creature”. See how you translated “birds” in verse 20.

according to its kind.
“{each} according to its {own} kind/type.” or “{each} that produces/has its own kind/type {of young}.” See how you translated this phrase earlier in this verse.

And God saw

that {it was} good.
“that {what he had created/made was} good/excellent.” or “that {the water animals and the birds were} good/excellent.” Some languages need to specify what was good. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-explicit)


Gen 1:22 Then God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let the bird{s} multiply on the earth.”

Then God blessed them,
“Then God caused them {all} to prosper/flourish” or “Then God blessed the water creatures/animals and the birds”. For some languages it is necessary to specify who “them” refers to. Do what is best in your language. (See: writing-pronouns)

saying,
“by saying {to them},” or “and said {first to the water animals},” God blesses the water animals first. If that is not clear, you could make that explicit here in the quote margin or at the beginning of what God says. (See: figs-explicit)
   
“Be fruitful 
“Reproduce” or “You water animals must/will produce/have many babies/young”. God speaks directly to the water animals using the second person (“you”), then later in the verse speaks about the birds in the third person (“the birds”). For some languages it is necessary to use either second person for both or third person for both, to prevent confusion. Do what is natural and clear in your language. (See: figs-123person)

and multiply
“so that you {and your offspring/descendants} {will} multiply/increase {greatly} {in number}” or “so that you {and your offspring/descendants} {will} become {very} numerous/many” (See: grammar-connect-logic-goal)
   
and fill
“and live all over the place in” or “and live throughout”

the waters in the seas,
“the water in/of the sea/ocean” or “the ocean/water”. For some languages, “water in the seas” is too repetitive, so it is more natural here to just say “seas/sea” or “ocean” or “water”. Do what is best in your language.
   
and let the bird{s}
“And the birds must/will {also}” or “{You} birds must/will {also}”. Consider whether it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
   
multiply
“increase {greatly} in number” or “become {very} numerous/many”. See how you translated “multiply” earlier in this verse.

“throughout the earth.” or “{and live} all over the earth.”


Gen 1:23 Then there was evening, and there was morning, the fifth day.

Then there was evening, and there was morning, 
“Then evening came and {then/later} morning came,”

the fifth day.
“{and that was} {the end of} the fifth day.” or “and the fifth day ended.”
 or “{and that was} {the end of} day five.” (See: translate-ordinal)

Gen 1:24 Then God said, “Let the land bring forth {every} living creature according to its kind: livestock and {every} crawling creature and {every} living thing of the earth, {each} according to its kind.” And it was so.

Then God said,
“Then God commanded,”

“Let the land
“I command the land/ground to” or “The land/ground must now”. See how you translated a similar command to the land in verse 11.

bring forth
“produce/yield”
   
{every} living creature
“{every kind/type of} living creature/animal” or “{all kinds/types of} creatures/animals,” This is a general term that refers to all the different kinds of creatures/animals that breathe, including the three large categories of animals mentioned below in this verse.

according to its kind:
“{each} that bears/has its own kind/type of offspring/young,” or “{each} bearing/having its own kind/type of offspring/young,” This phrase means that every kind of animal that God created always produces young that are the same kind of animal as their parents. See how you translated this phrase in verse 21, and see the note about that there.

livestock
“{including} domestic/farm/tame animals,” This term probably includes animals such as horses, camels, cattle, sheep and goats that people raise for food or use for farming or other work. This is in contrast to animals that normally live in the wild.

and {every} crawling creature
“{every} {kind/type of} creature/animal that crawls” or “{all kinds/types of} creatures/animals that crawl”

and {every} living thing of the earth,
“and {every} {other} {kind/type of} {wild/untamed} creature/animal {that lives} on the earth/land,” or “and {all} the {other} {kinds/types of} {wild/untamed} animals {that live} on the earth/land,” This phrase refers in general to animals that are normally not raised by people, but live in the wild.

{each} according to its kind.”
“{each} that bears/has its own kind/type of offspring/young.” or “{each} having its own kind/type of offspring/young.” See how you translated this phrase earlier in this verse.

And it was so.
“And that is {exactly} what happened.” or “It/Everything happened {exactly} as he commanded {it to happen}.”


Gen 1:25 So God made {every} creature of the earth according to its kind, and the livestock according to its kind, and every crawling creature of the ground according to its kind. And God saw that {it was} good.

So God made
“That is how God made/created” or “In that way God made/created”

{every} creature of the earth 
“{every kind/type of} wild/untamed creature/animal,” or “{all the different kinds/types of} wild/untamed creatures/animals,” See how you translated “{every} creature of the earth” in verse 24.

according to its kind,
“{each} that bears/has its own kind/type of offspring/young,” or “{each} having its own kind/type of offspring/young,”

and the livestock 
“and {every kind/type of} domestic/farm/tame animal,” or “and {all} the domestic/farm/tame animals,” See how you translated “livestock” in verse 24.

according to its kind,
“{each} that bears/has its {own} kind/type of offspring/young,” or “{each} having its {own} kind/type of offspring/young,”

and every crawling creature of the ground
“and every {kind/type of} creature/animal that crawls on/along the ground,” or “and all {different kinds/types of} creatures/animals that crawl on/along the ground,” See how you translated “crawling creature” in verse 24.

according to its kind.
“{each} that bears/has its own kind/type of offspring/young.” or “{each} having its {own} kind/type of offspring/young,” Consider again how you translated this phrase in verses 11, 12, 21, 24 and 25. It may be necessary to translate this phrase in different ways, depending on the context.

And God saw
“And he saw/observed” or “God/He saw/observed” 

that {it was} good.
“that {what he had made/created was} good/excellent.” or “that {all the creatures/animals that he had made/created were} good/excellent.” Some languages need to specify what was good. Consider again how you translated “And God saw that...good” in verses 10, 12, 18, 21, 25. (See: figs-explicit)

__________________________Paragraph Break________________________________

Gen 1:26 Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the bird{s} of the sky and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every moving creature moving on the earth.” 

Then God said,
“Then God said {to himself},” Here God is not commanding anything to happen, but is getting ready to personally create mankind himself (the details are given in Gen 2:7, 21-22). Some languages have to specify who is being spoken to. Do what is best in your language. (See: writing-quotations)

“Let us make
“{Now} we should/will make/create”. Most Bible scholars think that the plural pronouns (“us”, “our”) in this verse refer to God and reflect the fact that he is three Persons in one God. So it is best to keep these pronouns plural in your translation. Also, many translations capitalize the first letter of all pronouns that refer to God in order to show him honor and respect. Your translation team needs to decide whether or not you will do that, too. Be consistent with your decision as you translate the Bible.

man
“mankind/humankind” or “human beings”. The Hebrew word for “man” is used here (and in verse 27) as a collective noun that refers to human beings in general, including male and female.

in our image, according to our likeness,
“to be like us and act like us,” or “to be like us, so that they are similar to us in many ways,” These two phrases have similar meanings and emphasize that God made mankind to be like himself in many ways. (See: figs-doublet)

and let them rule over
“and let us put them in charge of” or “We will give them authority to rule/oversee/manage”

the fish of the sea 
“the fish of/in the sea/ocean,”

and over the bird{s} of the sky
“the birds {that fly} in the sky/air,” Some translations leave out the phrase “of the sky” because it is strongly implied and may not sound natural in their languages. However, if it is natural in your language, it is best to include this phrase, because the author repeatedly contrasts three large categories of animals in this section: creatures that live on the ground, creatures that swim in the water, and creatures that fly in the sky. 

and over the livestock
“the domestic/farm/tame animals,” Consider again how you translated “livestock” in verses 24-26.

and over all the earth
“and the entire earth,” This refers to the planet earth and everything on it, including water, soil, metals, minerals and other resources, as well as all the plants and animals.

and over every moving creature moving on the earth.”
“including every creature/animal that moves/lives on the earth.” or “and/including all the creatures/animals that move/live on the earth.” For some languages it is not natural to repeat “and” or “over” with each item in this list. Consider the best way to translate a list like this in your language.


Gen 1:27 Then God created man in his image. In the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.

Then God created
“So God created/made”. In this verse God does what he said he was going to do (verse 26). Make sure your translation does not sound like God created mankind twice. Also see how you translated “created” in verses 1 and 21. (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)
   
man
“mankind/humankind” or “human beings”. Be consistent here with how you translated this term in verse 26. (See: translate-key-terms)
   
in his image. 
“in his own image.” or “to be like himself.” or “to be similar to himself {in many ways}.” God made mankind to be like himself in some ways (not all ways) and to represent him in the world and show people what he is like. For example, God gave human beings an eternal spirit and the ability to have a relationship with him. He also gave us emotions, an understanding of right and wrong, and the ability to reason and make choices, to create new things and to have authority over the rest of creation. You could include some of that information in a footnote.
   
In the image of God he created him;
“{Yes/Indeed,} he created/made them in his image” or “{Indeed} God/he created/made them to be like himself” or “{Yes,} God/he created/made them to be similar to himself {in many ways}”. The pronoun “him” refers to the collective noun “man”, which in this case refers to human beings in general, not just one person. Also, this clause is the second half of a chiasm (an inverted parallelism) that repeats the first part of verse 27 in reverse order, to emphasize that it was in God’s image that human beings were created. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-parallelism)

male and female he created them. 
“He {also} created/made them {to be} male or female.” The phrase “male and female” comes first in the Hebrew text in order to emphasize it. Do what is accurate and natural in your language. Also make sure your translation of this verse does not sound like God is both male and female. (See: figs-figs-infostructure)

__________________________Paragraph Break________________________________

Gen 1:28 Then God blessed them, and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it. And rule over the fish of the sea and over the bird{s} of the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth.” 

Then God blessed them 
“Then God showed his favor to them” or “Then God caused them to prosper/flourish”. See how you translated “blessed” in verse 22.
   
and God said to them,
“and said,” or “by saying to them,” or “by saying,” or “He said,” Make sure it is clear in your translation of this quote margin that what God says next is the way that he blessed mankind, not something he said separately from that. (See: writing-quotations)
   
“Be fruitful 
“Bear/Have many children” or “You will bear/have many children”. See how you translated “Be fruitful and multiply” in verse 22. It may be necessary to translate the phrase in different ways, depending on the context.

and multiply,
“so that you {and your descendants} {will} multiply/increase {greatly} {in number}” or “so that you {and your descendants} {will} become {very} numerous/many” (See: grammar-connect-logic-goal)

and fill the earth
“and live all over the earth” or “and inhabit the whole earth” or “Fill the earth”. For some languages, it is more natural to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language.
   
and subdue it.
“and take control/care of it.” or “and bring it under your control.” 
   
And rule over
“You must rule over” or “You are in charge of” or “I am giving you authority to rule/oversee/manage”. See how you translated “rule” in verse 26.

the fish of the sea and over the bird{s} of the sky
“the fish in the ocean, the birds {that fly} in the sky/air,” See how you translated these phrases in verse 26.
   
and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”
“and every creature/animal that moves/lives on the earth/land.” or “and all the creatures/animals that move/live on the earth/land.” This phrase refers generally here to every kind of creature that lives on land.


Gen 1:29 Then God said, “Behold, I have given to you every plant {that} yields seed that is on the surface of the whole earth and every tree that {has} tree fruit {that} yields seed inside it. They will be yours for food.

Then God said,
“Then God/he {also} said {to them},” or “Then God/he continued/added,” God is still speaking to the human beings, so it may be necessary to add “also” to this quote margin. Some languages need to specify who is being spoken to. Other languages may leave this quote margin implied, since the same subject (God) is talking to the same people. However the repeated quote margin in the Hebrew text could show that God paused before continuing or that he is changing the topic, or to emphasize what he says next. So if it is natural to keep the quote margin here in your language, that is best. (See: writing-quotations)

“Behold,
“Look/Listen,” or “Listen to this,” or “I want you to know that”. This word means that what God says next is important and should be given special attention. Consider the best way to translate this term in your language. (See: translate-key-terms)

I have given to you
“I am {now} giving to you {as/for food}” or “I have provided {as food} for you” or “I am {now} providing {as food} for you”

every plant {that} yields seed that is
“every {kind/type of} seed-bearing plant that grows” or “every {kind/type of} plant with seeds that grows” or “all the {different kinds/types of} plants that yield/produce seeds and grow”. See how you translated a similar phrase in verses 11 and 12.

on the surface of the whole earth
“anywhere on/throughout the earth,”

and every tree that {has}
“as well as every {kind/type of} tree that {bears/produces}” or “and all the {different kinds/types of} trees that {bear/produce}”

tree fruit {that} yields seed inside it.
“fruit with seeds inside it.” or “seed-bearing fruit.” See how you translated a similar phrase in verses 11 and 12.

They will be yours for food.
“All of them are yours to eat from.” or “You may eat from any/all of those plants.”


Gen 1:30 And to every living thing of the earth, and to every bird of the sky, and to every{thing} moving on the earth that {has} living breath in it, {I have given} every green plant for food.” And it was so.

And
“In the same way,”

to every living thing of the earth,
“to every {kind/type of} {wild/untamed} creature/animal {that lives} on the earth/land,” or “to all the {wild/untamed} creatures/animals {that live} on the earth/land,” or “all the wild animals,” See how you translated a similar phrase in verses 24 and 25.

and to every bird of the sky,
“and every {kind/type of} bird {that flies} in the sky,” or “and all the birds {that fly} in the sky,”

and to every{thing} moving on the earth that {has} living breath in it,
“and every {other} {kind/type of} {creature/animal} that moves/lives on the earth/land and has the breath of life,” or “and all the {other} creatures/animals that move/live on the earth/land and breathe {air} to live,” See how you translated “that moves on the earth” in verse 28.

{I have given} every green plant for food.”
“{I give} every {kind/type of} green plant for/as food.” or “{I have given/provided} all the green plants for/as food.” For some languages it is clearer or more natural to put this phrase near the beginning of this verse and say, “In the same way, {I give} every {type of} green plant for food to all the {wild} animals {that live} on the earth, and all the birds {that fly} in the sky, and all the {other} animals {that live} on the land and breathe {air}.” Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated “plant” in verses 11, 12, 29. (See: figs-infostructure)

And it was so.
“And that is how it was.” or “And it/everything was {exactly} as he/God said {it should/would be}.” Consider again how you translated this sentence in verses 7, 9, 11, 15, 24 and 30. It may be necessary to translate it differently, depending on the context. For example, here in verse 30 this phrase follows a statement God made, which is different from the other contexts where it follows a command.

Gen 1:31 Then God saw all that he had made, and behold, it was very good. Then there was evening, and there was morning, the sixth day. 

Then God saw
“Then God observed/considered” or “Then God looked at”. See how you translated “God saw the light” in verse 4.

all that he had made,
“everything that he had made/created,” This refers to everything that God made during the entire week of Creation, not just on the sixth day. Consider again how you translated “made” (or “make”) in verses 7, 16, 25, 26 and 31. Compare that to how you translated a word that has a similar meaning (“created”) in verses 1, 21 and 27.

and behold,
“and indeed” or “and he saw/observed that”. This word calls attention to what God is looking at and helps emphasize that what he saw was very good.

it was very good.
“it was {all} very good/excellent.” Consider again how you translated “good/excellent” in verses 4, 10, 12, 18, 21, 25 and 31.

Then there was evening, and there was morning,
“Then evening came and {then/later} morning came,” Consider again how you translated these phrases in verses 5, 8, 13, 19, 23 and 31, and see the note about that at verse 5.
