GEN	1	1	ax17	figs-abstractnouns	בְּ⁠רֵאשִׁ֖ית	1	In the beginning	“At the beginning {of time/everything}” or “{Everything} began when”. Many Bible scholars think that verse one records God’s first act in creating the universe. This is also the traditional, historically-held view and fits with the narrative structure of the Hebrew text, as well as the wider context of Scriptures which states that God created everything out of nothing at the very beginning of the world (Psalm 33:6, 9; Hebrews 11:3). See the chapter introduction for more details about different interpretations of Genesis 1:1. Also, some languages must use a verb (“began”) in verse 1 rather than a noun (“beginning”). Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
GEN	1	1	ic3y	translate-key-terms	אֱלֹהִ֑ים	1	God	Translate the title “God” in a way that refers to the Supreme Being who created everything, who has complete power, who knows everything and is present everywhere. He is the only true God and has always existed. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms]])
GEN	1	1	th1c	translate-key-terms	בָּרָ֣א	1	created	“made”. In the Hebrew Bible, the verb “create” refers to an activity that only God does, and it often implies (as it does here) that he made something out of nothing. Also, the forms of the verbs in the Hebrew text (and the conjunctions) show that chapter one is a narrative that tells about true history and events in the order that things actually happened. Make sure that your translation does the same thing. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms]])
GEN	1	1	k70s	translate-key-terms	אֵ֥ת הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֖יִם	1	the heavens	“the sky”. This phrase refers here to the region where all the stars and planets would later exist. Keep that in mind as you translate this term. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms]])
GEN	1	1	c00a	translate-key-terms	וְ⁠אֵ֥ת הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	and the earth.	This phrase refers to the planet earth. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms]])
GEN	1	2	u0s6		וְ⁠הָ⁠אָ֗רֶץ	1	Now the earth	“Now {at first after that,} the earth” or “{At first after that,} the earth”. The author pauses here to describe what the earth was like after God first created it (verse 1). Some languages use a conjunction like “Now” to introduce that information; other languages do not use a conjunction here. Do what is natural in your language. Also, be consistent here with how you translated “the earth” in verse 1.
GEN	1	2	je1w		הָיְתָ֥ה תֹ֨הוּ֙ וָ⁠בֹ֔הוּ	1	was formless and empty,	It is not clear what the earth looked like at that time, but it did not have its present shape and order. Also, the Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) “was formless/shapeless and empty/desolate,” or “did not have {its present} form, and there was nothing {living} on it {yet},” (2) “completely empty/desolate,” which is a hendiadys. However it is best to keep both terms separate in your translation (as in the first interpretation).
GEN	1	2	ehsa		וְ⁠חֹ֖שֶׁךְ עַל פְּנֵ֣י תְה֑וֹם	1	and darkness {was} over the surface of the deep {waters},	“It was {totally/completely} dark, there was deep {water} {everywhere},” or “There was deep {water} {everywhere} {that was covered/surrounded} in/by {complete/total} darkness,” For some languages it is more natural to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language.
GEN	1	2	l2hu		וְ⁠ר֣וּחַ אֱלֹהִ֔ים מְרַחֶ֖פֶת	1	and the Spirit of God was hovering	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) “and God’s Spirit was hovering/moving” (2) “and a wind from God was blowing” (3) “and a powerful wind was blowing”. The first interpretation is most likely, since the Hebrew verb “hovering” does not describe what wind does.
GEN	1	2	vyre		עַל פְּנֵ֥י הַ⁠מָּֽיִם	1	over the surface of the waters.	“over the surface of the water.” or “above the waters/water.” Throughout this chapter, the word “waters” is in the plural in the Hebrew text. For some languages it is more natural to use the singular “water”. Do what is best in your language in each context.
GEN	1	3	qe1j	writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֥אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	Then God said,	“Then God commanded,” What God says in verse 3 is a command. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to make that explicit in this quote margin. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	1	3	a4w4		יְהִ֣י א֑וֹר	1	“Let there be light.”	“Let light exist.” or “I command there to be light.” or “I command light to start shining!” This is a command, not permission or a suggestion. It is a direct quote of what God actually said, and it is usually put between quotation marks in a translation. If you use an exclamation mark with this command in your translation, make sure it does not mean or imply that God was angry. Also, the way you translate “light” should refer to what shines from a source of light; it does not refer here to the source itself.
GEN	1	3	opxl		וַֽ⁠יְהִי אֽוֹר	1	And there was light.	“And/So {immediately} there was light.” or “And {so/immediately} light started shining.” Light began to shine immediately as a result of God’s command.
GEN	1	4	zfnn	grammar-connect-words-phrases	וַ⁠יַּ֧רְא אֱלֹהִ֛ים	1	And God saw	“And he saw/observed” or “God/He saw/observed”. Notice that Hebrew frequently uses a conjunction such as “And” or “Then” at the beginning of a sentence. Some languages do not use conjunctions as frequently as Hebrew does. Do what is accurate and natural in your language in each context. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
GEN	1	4	l24u	translate-key-terms	אֶת הָ⁠א֖וֹר כִּי ט֑וֹב	1	the light, that {it was} good.	“that the light {was} good/excellent.” In the Bible, “good” is an important theme. Throughout chapter one, it especially means that what God created was high quality, complete, and had no defects; in other words, it had all the characteristics and functions that God intended it to have. It also includes the idea that what God created was untainted by sin and reflected his good character (Psalm 19:1; Romans 1:20). The focus here is not on how pleased or satisfied God was. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms]])
GEN	1	4	zt0z	writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יַּבְדֵּ֣ל אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	Then God	“Then he”. In order to produce an accurate and natural translation, it is important in each context to make sure that nouns (such as “God”) and pronouns (such as “he”) are used properly in your language. In the Hebrew text, “God” is repeated frequently in chapter one to emphasize him and show that he is in focus. For some languages it is more natural to say “God” only once at the beginning of each paragraph or section, and then use pronouns to refer to him the rest of the time (or most of the time). Throughout chapter one, do what is best in your language each time that God is referred to. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	1	4	ynnj		וַ⁠יַּבְדֵּ֣ל בֵּ֥ין הָ⁠א֖וֹר וּ⁠בֵ֥ין הַ⁠חֹֽשֶׁךְ	1	separated between the light and the darkness.	“separated/divided the light from the darkness {so that each had its own time}.” or “caused the light to have its own time and the darkness to have its own time.” or “separated the light from the darkness {so that it would be light for a number of hours, and then dark for a number of hours}.”
GEN	1	5	k92z	grammar-connect-words-phrases	וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֨א אֱלֹהִ֤ים	1	And God called	“Then God/he called/named” or “God/He called/named”. Some languages omit the connecting word “And” or “Then” here. Consider the best way in your language to connect this sentence with the previous one. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
GEN	1	5	v4xk		לָ⁠אוֹר֙ י֔וֹם	1	the light Day,	“the light Daytime.” Notice that in this context the word “Day” refers only to the time when the sun is shining, not to the 24-hour time period that makes up a complete day. Make sure that this is clear in your translation. Throughout chapter one, some translations use quote marks around the names that God gives the different things he created.
GEN	1	5	vagh		וְ⁠לַ⁠חֹ֖שֶׁךְ קָ֣רָא לָ֑יְלָה	1	and the darkness he called Night.	“and the darkness he called/named Nighttime.” or “and he called/named the darkness Nighttime.” In the Hebrew text, “the darkness” is first in this clause to emphasize the contrast between the light and the darkness. Consider the best way to translate this clause in your language.
GEN	1	5	ibn4	grammar-connect-time-sequential	וַֽ⁠יְהִי עֶ֥רֶב וַֽ⁠יְהִי בֹ֖קֶר	0	Then there was evening, and there was morning,	“Then evening came and {then/later} morning came,” The evening and the morning are the parts of a 24-hour day that separate the hours of daytime (light) from the hours of nighttime (darkness): Evening came at the end of each daytime after God finished his work of creating. Then after about 12 hours of nighttime, morning came, which began the next 12 hours of daytime when God did more work. Make sure your translation does not sound like morning came immediately after evening. Some languages have a one-word conjunction that means “and then” or “and later” that fits well here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
GEN	1	5	cbfn	translate-ordinal	י֥וֹם אֶחָֽד	1	one day.	“{and that was} day one.” or “{and that was} {the end of} the first day.” Here “day” refers to a full 24-hour day. Also, the Hebrew text uses a cardinal number (“one”) here, but then uses ordinal numbers (“second”, “third”, and so on) for the rest of the days of creation week. Some languages need to use an ordinal number (“first”) here too. Other languages use cardinal numbers throughout (“day one”, “day two”, and so on). Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
GEN	1	6	qgjp	writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	Then God said,	“Then God commanded,” See how you translated this phrase in verse 3. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	1	6	b07i		יְהִ֥י רָקִ֖יעַ	1	“Let there be an expanse	“Let there be a large/vast space” or “I command there to be a {large/vast} expanse/space” or “I command a large/vast space to form/exist”. The Hebrew word for “expanse” here describes a large space that is “spread out.” It was not solid, rather it was open and empty and could be seen through and flown through (verse 20). It was probably also curved, following the spherical shape of the earth. See how you translated “Let there be” in verse 3.
GEN	1	6	h25k		בְּ⁠ת֣וֹךְ הַ⁠מָּ֑יִם	1	in the middle of the waters,	“in the middle of the water,” See how you translated “waters” in verse 2.
GEN	1	6	jqx5		מַ֖יִם לָ⁠מָֽיִם	1	and let it separate the waters from the waters.”	“and let it separate/divide the water {above it} from the water {below it}.” or “so that it separates/divides the waters/water into two separate/different places.”
GEN	1	7	coip		וַ⁠יַּ֣עַשׂ אֱלֹהִים֮	1	So God made	“In that way God/he made/created” or “That is how God/he made/created”. Verse 7 explains what God’s command in verse 6 caused to happen, and it repeats some of the same words and phrases. Make sure that your translation of these verses does not sound like God created the expanse twice.
GEN	1	7	k473		אֶת הָ⁠רָקִיעַ֒	1	the expanse	“a large/vast space”
GEN	1	7	c4wk		וַ⁠יַּבְדֵּ֗ל	1	and separated	“and divided” or “and used it to separate/divide”
GEN	1	7	tdid	writing-pronouns	בֵּ֤ין הַ⁠מַּ֨יִם֙ אֲשֶׁר֙ מִ⁠תַּ֣חַת לָ⁠רָקִ֔יעַ וּ⁠בֵ֣ין הַ⁠מַּ֔יִם אֲשֶׁ֖ר מֵ⁠עַ֣ל לָ⁠רָקִ֑יעַ	1	between the waters that {were} under the expanse and the waters that {were} above the expanse.	“the water that {was} below the expanse/space from the water that {was} above it.” or “the water that {was} under/below it from the water that {was} above it.” For some languages it is more natural to use a pronoun (“it”) here to refer to the expanse, since it was just mentioned earlier in the verse. Each language has its own system of when to use nouns or pronouns to refer to people, places and things. In each context, do what is clear and natural in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	1	7	p5mn	figs-explicit	וַֽ⁠יְהִי כֵֽן	1	And it was so.	“That is the way it happened.” or “Everything was/happened {exactly} as he commanded {it to be/happen}.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	1	8	w651	grammar-connect-words-phrases	וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֧א אֱלֹהִ֛ים	1	And God called	“and God/he called/named” or “God/He called/named”. Consider whether it is more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here (with or without a conjunction), or to continue the sentence that began at the end of verse 7. Also see how you translated this phrase in verse 5. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
GEN	1	8	a0bw		לָֽ⁠רָקִ֖יעַ	1	the expanse	“the large/vast space”. See how you translated this phrase in verses 6 and 7.
GEN	1	8	h2yj	translate-key-terms	שָׁמָ֑יִם	1	Heavens.	“Sky.” This word probably refers here to the atmosphere above the earth’s surface where clouds are and where birds fly, as well as the space where the sun, moon, and stars are now. See how you translated this term in verse 1. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms]])
GEN	1	8	ufym		וַֽ⁠יְהִי עֶ֥רֶב וַֽ⁠יְהִי בֹ֖קֶר	1	Then there was evening, and there was morning,	“Then evening came and {then/later} morning came,” See how you translated this sentence in verse 5, and see the note about that there.
GEN	1	8	ptrz	translate-ordinal	י֥וֹם שֵׁנִֽי	1	the second day.	“{and that was} {the end of} the second day.” or “{and} the second day ended.” or “{and that was} {the end of} day two.” Consider whether it is more natural in your language to use an ordinal number (“second”) here or a cardinal number (“two”). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
GEN	1	9	nsft	writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֗ים	1	Then God said,	“Then God commanded,” See how you translated this phrase in verses 3 and 6. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	1	9	mlab	figs-activepassive	יִקָּו֨וּ הַ⁠מַּ֜יִם מִ⁠תַּ֤חַת הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֨יִם֙	1	“Let the waters under the heavens be gathered	“Let the water {that is} under the heavens/sky gather/come together” or “I command the water {that is} below the heavens/sky to gather/come together”. Consider whether it is better here in your language to use a passive form of the verb (“be gathered”) or an active form (“gather” or “come”). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
GEN	1	9	nosf		אֶל מָק֣וֹם אֶחָ֔ד	1	to one place,	“in one place/area” or “into one area”
GEN	1	9	u9q3		וְ⁠תֵרָאֶ֖ה הַ⁠יַּבָּשָׁ֑ה	1	and let the dry ground appear.”	“so that there is dry ground/land.” or “so that dry ground/land can be seen.” or “so that land is uncovered and dries off.” The water had been covering the land, so when the water receded from it, the land became exposed and dried off. Make sure that the way you translate “dry ground” does not sound like the land was dry while it was under the water.
GEN	1	9	u1i5		וַֽ⁠יְהִי כֵֽן	1	And it was so.	“And that is {exactly} what happened.” or “And it was/happened {exactly} as God commanded {it to be/happen}.” See how you translated this sentence in verse 7. It may be necessary to translate it in different ways, depending on the context.
GEN	1	10	urzv		וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֨א אֱלֹהִ֤ים	1	And God called	“Then God/he called/named”
GEN	1	10	tpui		לַ⁠יַּבָּשָׁה֙	1	the dry ground	“the dry land” or “the ground/land that had dried off”
GEN	1	10	vz3b		אֶ֔רֶץ	1	Land,	“Ground,” This is the same Hebrew word that is translated as “earth” in verse 1, but here it refers to the dry land or ground (in contrast to the water), not the entire planet.
GEN	1	10	t1mu	figs-infostructure	וּ⁠לְ⁠מִקְוֵ֥ה הַ⁠מַּ֖יִם קָרָ֣א	1	and the gathered waters he called	“and the waters/water that he had gathered together he called/named” or “and he called/named the gathered waters” or “and he called/named the waters/water that had gathered/come together”. See how you translated a sentence in verse 5 that is similar in structure to this sentence. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	1	10	akm3		יַמִּ֑ים	1	Seas.	“Oceans.” or “Sea/Ocean.” At that time there was probably just one very large body of water and one very large land mass on the earth (as verse 9 indicates). So a singular noun that refers to the largest body of water, such as “Ocean” or “Sea”, could be used here in your translation.
GEN	1	10	innb	writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יַּ֥רְא אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	And God saw	“And he saw/observed” or “God/He saw/observed”. Decide whether it is more natural in your language to use a noun (“God”) or a pronoun (“he”) in this context. See how you translated this phrase in verse 4. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	1	10	qpyo		כִּי טֽוֹב	1	that {it was} good.	“that {what he had made was} good/excellent.” or “that {the land and the seas/ocean were} good/excellent.” Some languages cannot use a pronoun (“it”) here, but have to specify what was good. Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated the word “good” in verse 4, and see the note about that there.
GEN	1	11	gq63	writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֗ים	1	Then God said,	“Then God commanded,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	1	11	ydgm		תַּֽדְשֵׁ֤א הָ⁠אָ֨רֶץ֙	1	“Let the land	“I command the land/ground to” or “The land/ground must now”. Notice that when God commands the land to do something, it obeys him. See how you translated “Land” in verse 10.
GEN	1	11	l9x6		תַּֽדְשֵׁ֤א דֶּ֔שֶׁא	1	sprout vegetation:	“grow/produce {green} plants,” or “be covered with {green} plants,” The Hebrew word for “vegetation” refers generally here to any kind of green plant and includes the plants and trees that are mentioned next in this verse.
GEN	1	11	niqr		עֵ֚שֶׂב מַזְרִ֣יעַ זֶ֔רַע	1	{every} plant yielding seed,	“{including} {every kind/type of} plant that produces/has seeds” or “{including} {all kinds/types of} plants that produce/have seeds”. This phrase refers to many different kinds of plants, not just one plant or one seed. Make sure that is clear in your translation. Also, these kinds of plants have soft stems and include vegetable plants, herbs and other plants that produce edible seeds, such as rice, corn and wheat.
GEN	1	11	bz9s		עֵ֣ץ פְּרִ֞י עֹ֤שֶׂה פְּרִי֙ לְ⁠מִינ֔⁠וֹ	1	{every} fruit tree bearing fruit according to its kind,	“{and} fruit trees that bear/produce fruit, {each} according to its {own} kind/type,” or “{and} {every kind/type of} fruit tree that bears/produces/has its own kind/type of fruit” or “{and} {all kinds/types of} fruit trees that bear/produce/have their own kind/type of fruit”. The phrase “according to its kind” emphasizes that each different kind of tree produces its own kind of fruit and seeds, which grow and become only that kind of tree. For example, apple trees always produce apples with apple seeds, never peaches or cherries, or any other kind of fruit or seeds.
GEN	1	11	jwpm		אֲשֶׁ֥ר זַרְע⁠וֹ ב֖⁠וֹ	1	that {has} its seed inside it,	“that {has} seeds inside,” or “with seeds inside,” or “with its {own kind/type of} seeds inside it,”
GEN	1	11	n5v5	figs-infostructure	עַל הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	on the earth.”	“throughout the earth.” or “all over the earth.” For some languages it is clearer and more natural to put this phrase earlier in this verse and say, “Let the land sprout vegetation on/throughout the earth...” Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	1	11	pn2g		וַֽ⁠יְהִי כֵֽן	1	And it was so.	“And that is {exactly} what happened:” or “And it/everything happened {exactly} as God commanded {it to happen}:” Either a period or a colon can be used here, but a colon more clearly shows that verse 12 gives the details of what happened. This is different from verse 7 where the details of what happened come before “And it was so”, and from verse 9 where no additional details are given.
GEN	1	12	nlty		וַ⁠תּוֹצֵ֨א הָ⁠אָ֜רֶץ דֶּ֠שֶׁא	1	So the land brought out vegetation:	“The land sprouted/produced vegetation/plants,” or “The land started growing/producing {green} plants,” Verse 12 explains what God’s command in verse 11 caused to happen, and it repeats some of the same words and phrases. Make sure that your translation of these verses does not sound like God created the plants twice.
GEN	1	12	o9qy		עֵ֣שֶׂב מַזְרִ֤יעַ זֶ֨רַע֙ לְ⁠מִינֵ֔⁠הוּ	1	{every} plant yielding seed according to its kind,	“{including} plants that produce/have seeds, {each} according to its {own} kind/type,” or “{including} {every kind/type of} plant that produces/has seeds that grow into the same kind/type of plant,” or “{including} {all kinds/types of} plants that produce/have their own kind/type of seeds,”

GEN	1	12	k8n4	figs-explicit	כִּי טֽוֹב	1	that {it was} good.	“that {what he had made/created was} good/excellent.” or “that {all the plants and trees were} good/excellent.” See how you translated this clause in verse 10.

GEN	1	13	s0ib		וַֽ⁠יְהִי עֶ֥רֶב וַֽ⁠יְהִי בֹ֖קֶר	1	Then there was evening, and there was morning,	“Then evening came and {then/later} morning came,” See how you translated this sentence in verses 5 and 8.
GEN	1	13	yqc6	translate-ordinal	י֥וֹם שְׁלִישִֽׁי	1	the third day.	“{and that was} {the end of} the third day.” or “{and} the third day {ended}.” or “{and that was} {the end of} day three.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])

These lights refer to the sun, moon and stars that give off light. But it is important to keep this general in your translation (like the Hebrew text does) and not specify the names of these lights.
GEN	1	14	ib7w		בִּ⁠רְקִ֣יעַ הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֔יִם	1	in the expanse of the heavens	“in the expanse/space of/called the heavens/sky” or “in the open space of the heavens/sky” or “in the heavens/sky”. The expanse is the same thing as the heavens (verse 8), so some translations leave “the expanse of” implied here. Do what is best in your language.
GEN	1	14	zuhs		לְ⁠הַבְדִּ֕יל	1	to separate	“to divide/distinguish” or “that separate/divide”

GEN	1	14	hof1		וְ⁠הָי֤וּ לְ⁠אֹתֹת֙	1	And let them be for	“Let those lights/lamps also be” or “They must/will also serve/function as” or “I also command those lights/lamps to serve/function as”
GEN	1	14	gazm		לְ⁠אֹתֹת֙ וּ⁠לְ⁠מ֣וֹעֲדִ֔ים	1	signs, and for	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) “signs/markers {of special/important events}, and {they must/will} mark” or “mark/indicate when important things happen, and {they must/will} mark” (2) “signs/markers that mark/indicate/show”. The word “signs” means that the lights can mark certain times of the year. Following the first interpretation, the lights are to also mark special events (such as the star that signaled Jesus’ birth and the darkened sun at Jesus’ death).
GEN	1	14	ynh4		וּ⁠לְ⁠מ֣וֹעֲדִ֔ים וּ⁠לְ⁠יָמִ֖ים וְ⁠שָׁנִֽים	1	seasons, and for days and years.	“seasons, days and years.” or “when seasons, days and years begin {and end}.” The sun and moon show the passing of time. For example, the 30-day month is determined by the phases of the moon, and the 365-day year is determined by the time it takes for the earth to travel around the sun. Seasons are regular times of the year, such as seed-planting and harvesting times, and the seasons of spring, summer, fall and winter (Genesis 8:22), as well as the special festivals which God appointed for his people to meet with him. You could put some of that information in a footnote.

GEN	1	26	blag		נַֽעֲשֶׂ֥ה	1	“Let us make	“{Now} we should/will make/create”. Most Bible scholars think that the plural pronouns (“us”, “our”) in this verse refer to God and reflect the fact that he is three Persons in one God. So it is best to keep these pronouns plural in your translation. Also, many translations capitalize the first letter of all pronouns that refer to God in order to show him honor and respect. Your translation team needs to decide whether or not you will do that, too. Be consistent with your decision as you translate the Bible.
GEN	1	26	tiqo		אָדָ֛ם	1	man	“mankind/humankind” or “human beings”. The Hebrew word for “man” is used here (and in verse 27) as a collective noun that refers to human beings in general, including male and female.

However, if it is natural in your language, it is best to include this phrase, because the author repeatedly contrasts three large categories of animals in this section: creatures that live on the ground, creatures that swim in the water, and creatures that fly in the sky.
GEN	1	26	j3kw		וּ⁠בַ⁠בְּהֵמָה֙	1	and over the livestock	“the domestic/farm/tame animals,” Consider again how you translated “livestock” in verses 24-26.

For example, God gave human beings an eternal spirit and the ability to have a relationship with him. He also gave us emotions, an understanding of right and wrong, and the ability to reason and make choices, to create new things and to have authority over the rest of creation.

The pronoun “him” refers to the collective noun “man”, which in this case refers to human beings in general, not just one person. Also, this clause is the second half of a chiasm (an inverted parallelism) that repeats the first part of verse 27 in reverse order, to emphasize that it was in God’s image that human beings were created.

GEN	1	29	cjqx	writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֗ים	1	Then God said,	“Then God/he {also} said {to them},” or “Then God/he continued/added,” God is still speaking to the human beings, so it may be necessary to add “also” to this quote margin. Some languages need to specify who is being spoken to. Other languages may leave this quote margin implied, since the same subject (God) is talking to the same people. However the repeated quote margin in the Hebrew text could show that God paused before continuing or that he is changing the topic, or to emphasize what he says next. So if it is natural to keep the quote margin here in your language, that is best. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	1	29	zdhx	translate-key-terms	הִנֵּה֩	1	“Behold,	“Look/Listen,” or “Listen to this,” or “I want you to know that”. This word means that what God says next is important and should be given special attention. Consider the best way to translate this term in your language.

Also see how you translated “plant” in verses 11, 12, 29. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	1	30	tsjy		וַֽ⁠יְהִי כֵֽן	1	And it was so.	“And that is how it was.” or “And it/everything was {exactly} as he/God said {it should/would be}.” Consider again how you translated this sentence in verses 7, 9, 11, 15, 24 and 30. It may be necessary to translate it differently, depending on the context. For example, here in verse 30 this phrase follows a statement God made, which is different from the other contexts where it follows a command.
GEN	1	31	gf2n		וַ⁠יַּ֤רְא אֱלֹהִים֙	1	Then God saw	“Then God observed/considered” or “Then God looked at”. See how you translated “God saw the light” in verse 4.
GEN	1	31	lja2		אֶת כָּל אֲשֶׁ֣ר עָשָׂ֔ה	1	all that he had made,	“everything that he had made/created,” This refers to everything that God made during the entire week of Creation, not just on the sixth day. Consider again how you translated “made” (or “make”) in verses 7, 16, 25, 26 and 31. Compare that to how you translated a word that has a similar meaning (“created”) in verses 1, 21 and 27.
GEN	1	31	i1sm		וְ⁠הִנֵּה	1	and behold,	“and indeed” or “and he saw/observed that”. This word calls attention to what God is looking at and helps emphasize that what he saw was very good.
GEN	1	31	edfx		ט֖וֹב מְאֹ֑ד	1	it was very good.	“it was {all} very good/excellent.” Consider again how you translated “good/excellent” in verses 4, 10, 12, 18, 21, 25 and 31.
GEN	1	31	hdou		וַֽ⁠יְהִי עֶ֥רֶב וַֽ⁠יְהִי בֹ֖קֶר	1	Then there was evening, and there was morning,	“Then evening came and {then/later} morning came,” Consider again how you translated these phrases in verses 5, 8, 13, 19, 23 and 31, and see the note about that at verse 5.
GEN	1	31	xybo	translate-ordinal	י֥וֹם הַ⁠שִּׁשִּֽׁי	1	the sixth day.	“{and that was} {the end of} the sixth day.” or “and the sixth day ended.” or “{and that was} {the end of} day six.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
GEN	2	1	s5mr	figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יְכֻלּ֛וּ הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֥יִם וְ⁠הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ	1	So the heavens and the earth were completed,	“So {it was that} the heavens and the earth were completed/finished {by God},” or “That is how {God} finished {creating/making} the heavens and the earth,” Verse one is a summary statement that looks back at what God did in chapter one. Make sure that is clear in your language. Also consider whether it is better in your language to use an active or passive clause here, and see how you translated “heavens and earth” in Gen 1:1. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
GEN	2	1	b6ji		וְ⁠כָל צְבָאָֽ⁠ם	1	and all their hosts.	“including all the many things that are in them.” or “along with everything in them.” This phrase refers to everything in the heavens and on the earth that God had created, as described in chapter one.
GEN	2	2	qmeq	translate-ordinal	וַ⁠יְכַ֤ל בַּ⁠יּ֣וֹם הַ⁠שְּׁבִיעִ֔י	1	And by the seventh day	“By the seventh day” or “By day seven”. Make sure it is clear in your translation that God had completed his work by the seventh day and did not work on that day. Also consider again how you translated ordinal numbers in Gen 1:5, 8, 13, 19, 23, 31; 2:2. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
GEN	2	2	ogqz	writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יְכַ֤ל אֱלֹהִים֙	1	God had completed	“God/he had completed/finished” or “God/he was finished with”. Decide whether it is better in your language to refer to God with a title (“God”) or a pronoun (“he”) in this context. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	2	2	d7d7		מְלַאכְתּ֖⁠וֹ אֲשֶׁ֣ר עָשָׂ֑ה	1	his work that he had done,	“his/the work he had been doing,”

God “rested” in the sense that he stopped his work and did not work on that day. It does not mean he was tired or had lost his strength. Rest is an important theme in the Bible, so you should try to be consistent in how you translate this term here and in other passages such as Exodus 23:12, 31:17 and Hebrews 4:4, 10. Part of this theme includes the Hebrew word for “Sabbath” which has the same root word as the verb for “rest” and is often translated “resting day”.
GEN	2	2	u3yi		מְלַאכְתּ֖⁠וֹ אֲשֶׁ֣ר עָשָׂ֑ה	1	his work that he had done.	“the work that he had been doing.” or “that work.”
GEN	2	3	bdw0	grammar-connect-words-phrases	וַ⁠יְבָ֤רֶךְ אֱלֹהִים֙	1	And God	“Then God/he” or “God/He”. For some languages it is more natural to begin verse 3 without a conjunction. Other languages use a conjunction here like Hebrew does. Do what is natural in your language.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
GEN	2	3	i94z		וַ⁠יְבָ֤רֶךְ אֶת י֣וֹם הַ⁠שְּׁבִיעִ֔י	1	blessed the seventh day	“established/designated the seventh day {as a day} to bless {people}” or “honored the seventh day”

GEN	2	3	hhzf		כִּ֣י ב֤⁠וֹ	1	because on it	“because on/during that day” or “{He did that} because on/during that day”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
GEN	2	3	dazz		שָׁבַת֙ מִ⁠כָּל מְלַאכְתּ֔⁠וֹ	1	he rested from all his work	“he ceased from all his/the work” or “he did not do any more work” or “he no longer did the work”. See how you translated a similar clause in verse 2.
GEN	2	3	k6a7	writing-pronouns	אֲשֶׁר בָּרָ֥א אֱלֹהִ֖ים לַ⁠עֲשֽׂוֹת	1	of creating that God had done.	“of creating that he had been doing.” or “that he had been doing, creating {everything}.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	2	4	ho91		אֵ֣לֶּה	1	These {are}	“These {are more details about}” or “This {is more about}” or “What follows {gives/tells more details about}”. This phrase refers forward to Gen 2:5-24 and begins a new section. Chapter one of Genesis gives an overview of what God did each day of creation week, including that he created human beings on day six. Chapter two gives more details about how God created Adam and Eve, who were his most important creations. Each chapter emphasizes different parts of the same history; they are not two different histories. Make sure that is clear in your translation.
GEN	2	4	qo9r	figs-activepassive	תוֹלְד֧וֹת הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֛יִם וְ⁠הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ בְּ⁠הִבָּֽרְאָ֑⁠ם	1	the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created,	“the history of the heavens and the earth when they were created {by God},” or “what happened when {God} created the heavens and the earth.” or “the history of what {God} did when he created the heavens and the earth:” The Hebrew text uses a passive construction here to emphasize the heavens and the earth. Decide the best way to do that in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
GEN	2	4	j5cc		בְּ⁠י֗וֹם עֲשׂ֛וֹת	1	in the day when	“during the days/time when” or “During the days/time when”. Consider whether or not it is clearer or more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here that continues into verse 5.
GEN	2	4	ny24	translate-key-terms	יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	Yahweh God	“Yahweh {who is} God” or “God {whose name is} Yahweh”. This phrase is a combination of God’s personal name “Yahweh” with his title “God”. Both are used together when he is especially in focus. This pattern of using a personal name and a title together is also used for people in the Old Testament when they are being emphasized, for example, “Ahab king of Israel” and “Ruth the Moabite”. Many translations have “LORD God” in place of “Yahweh God” throughout the Old Testament. This follows the Jewish custom of substituting the Hebrew title “Adonai” (which means “my Lord”) for “Yahweh” (which means “he is”) when they read the Scriptures aloud. More recently, translation teams are putting “Yahweh” back in the Bible text (especially in the Old Testament, but also in the New Testament), and they include a footnote to explain the term. (Some translation teams consider using “Jehovah” instead of “Yahweh”. However that is not a name from the Bible, but is formed by taking the consonants from “Yahweh” and combining them with the vowels from “Adonai”.) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms]])
GEN	2	4	ddxz	figs-chiasm	עֲשׂ֛וֹת אֶ֥רֶץ וְ⁠שָׁמָֽיִם	1	made the earth and the heavens,	“made/created the earth and the heavens”. This clause forms a chiasm with “the heavens and the earth...created” in the first part of this verse. Try to keep the same phrase order in your translation. See how you translated “the heavens” and “the earth” in Gen 1:1 and 2:1. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-chiasm]])
GEN	2	5	fjpl	grammar-connect-time-background	וְ⁠כֹ֣ל	1	and	“And/Now {for a while,}” or “{For a while,}” or “{for a while,}” Consider whether it is better in your translation to begin a new sentence here or continue the sentence from the end of verse 4. Verses 5-6 give background information about what things were like before God created mankind (verse 7). Some languages use a conjunction like “Now” to introduce background information, while other languages do not use a conjunction. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
GEN	2	5	wb2f		וְ⁠כֹ֣ל שִׂ֣יחַ הַ⁠שָּׂדֶ֗ה טֶ֚רֶם יִֽהְיֶ֣ה בָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	every shrub of the field had not yet appeared on the earth,	“there were not yet any shrubs/bushes {growing} in the fields on the earth,” or “no wild shrubs/bushes had started growing on the earth yet,”
GEN	2	5	sufn		וְ⁠כָל עֵ֥שֶׂב הַ⁠שָּׂדֶ֖ה טֶ֣רֶם יִצְמָ֑ח	1	and every plant of the field had not yet sprung up,	“nor had any {other} plants started growing yet,” or “and there were not any {other} plants that had sprouted yet,” See how you translated “plants” in Gen 1:11-12, 29-30.
GEN	2	5	rd7r	writing-pronouns	כִּי֩ יְהוָ֤ה אֱלֹהִים֙	1	because Yahweh God	“because Yahweh/he” or “{That was} because God”. The Hebrew text repeats “Yahweh God” frequently in chapter 2 (starting in verse 4) to emphasize God. For some languages, it is not natural to repeat “Yahweh God” so often in the same paragraph, and it could even give the wrong meaning that there was more than one Yahweh God. For languages like that, it may be best to use “Yahweh God” only once at the beginning of a section or paragraph, then use “Yahweh”, “God”, or “he” in the rest of the section, depending on the context. Consider what is the most accurate and natural way to refer to Yahweh God at each point in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	2	5	srr6		לֹ֨א הִמְטִ֜יר עַל הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	had not caused it to rain on the earth,	“had not {yet} caused it to rain on the earth,” or “had not {yet} sent/caused rain to water the earth,” See how you translated “earth” in Gen 1:1 and 2:1.
GEN	2	5	xlm7		וְ⁠אָדָ֣ם אַ֔יִן	1	and there was no man	“and there were no human beings {yet}” or “and mankind/humans did not exist {yet}”
GEN	2	5	k8lk		לַֽ⁠עֲבֹ֖ד אֶת הָֽ⁠אֲדָמָֽה	1	to work the ground.	“to cultivate/farm the land/soil.” Working the ground includes tasks such as clearing the ground, preparing the soil, planting seeds, and watering the plants. See how you translated “ground” in Gen 1:25. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.
GEN	2	6	uvz9	grammar-connect-phrases-words	וְ⁠אֵ֖ד	1	But mist	“But {during/at that time} mist/water/groundwater” or “{During/At that time} mist/springs”. The Hebrew word for “mist” refers to water in some form, such as water vapor, springs, or streams of water. Also, some translations begin verse 6 without “But”. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-phrases-words]])
GEN	2	6	lbsq		יַֽעֲלֶ֣ה	1	came up	“seeped up” or “kept coming/seeping up” or “would come/seep up”. This verb describes a repeated or continuous action.
GEN	2	6	b722		מִן הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	from the earth	“from the ground” or “from underground”
GEN	2	6	g4fm		וְ⁠הִשְׁקָ֖ה	1	and watered	“and irrigated” or “and spread over” or “supplied water to”
GEN	2	6	c1og		אֶֽת כָּל פְּנֵֽי הָֽ⁠אֲדָמָֽה	1	all of the surface of the ground.	“the entire/whole surface of the land/earth.” or “the ground everywhere.”
GEN	2	7	a272		וַ⁠יִּיצֶר֩ יְהוָ֨ה אֱלֹהִ֜ים	1	Then Yahweh God	“Then Yahweh {who is} God”. The phrase “Yahweh God” is used here to emphasize that he is the one who created mankind. So it is best to keep that here in your translation, unless that would communicate wrong meaning. See how you translated this phrase in Gen 2:4-5.
GEN	2	7	b2zn		וַ⁠יִּיצֶר֩	1	formed	“shaped” or “crafted”. This word describes what an expert craftsmen would do, and implies artistic skills and design.
GEN	2	7	rfqb		אֶת הָֽ⁠אָדָ֗ם	1	the man	“a man” or “the {first} man”. The definite article “the” is used here because this refers to a specific man, the first male human. For many languages it is more natural to use an indefinite article (“a”) to introduce him here, or to not use an article at all. Do what is best in your language.
GEN	2	7	lxfh		עָפָר֙	1	{out of} dust	“{out of} dirt/mud/clay”. The word used here in the Hebrew text is usually translated “dust” (as in Gen 13:16, 28:14), but it can also be translated “dirt” (as in Gen 26:15) or “mortar/mud/clay” (as in Leviticus 14:42). The dirt would have been damp enough to be formed or shaped.
GEN	2	7	xb7z		מִן הָ֣⁠אֲדָמָ֔ה	1	from the ground,	“from the earth,” See how you translated “ground” in Gen 1:25 and 2:5-6. You may need to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.
GEN	2	7	vqn1		וַ⁠יִּפַּ֥ח	1	and he breathed	“and he/Yahweh blew/exhaled” or “Then he/Yahweh blew/exhaled”. For some languages, it is more natural to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language.
GEN	2	7	yxb9	writing-pronouns	בְּ⁠אַפָּ֖י⁠ו נִשְׁמַ֣ת חַיִּ֑ים	1	into his nostrils the breath of life,	“into the man’s nostrils/nose the/his breath that would make him live,” or “his breath into the man’s nostrils/nose to make him live,” This refers to God’s breath. As you translate the pronouns “he” and “his” in this verse, make sure it is clear in your language who is being referred to. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	2	7	b9my	writing-pronouns	וַֽ⁠יְהִ֥י הָֽ⁠אָדָ֖ם	1	and the man	“so that he” or “and then the man”. Consider what is the most natural way in your language to refer to the man throughout verse 7. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	2	7	g4mi		וַֽ⁠יְהִ֥י לְ⁠נֶ֥פֶשׁ חַיָּֽה	1	became a living being.	“became a living person.” or “became alive.” or “came to life.” or “started to live.”
GEN	2	8	tad7	writing-background	וַ⁠יִּטַּ֞ע יְהוָ֧ה אֱלֹהִ֛ים	1	Now Yahweh God had planted	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean (1) “Now Yahweh God had {previously/already} planted” or “{Before that,} Yahweh God had planted”. This interpretation fits the context of chapter one, which says that God had made all the trees and plants on day three (Gen 1:11-12), three days before he created man (Gen 1:26-27; 2:7). Following this view, verses 8-14 give background information for what happens in verses 15-24. (2) “Then Yahweh God planted”. According to this interpretation, God made the Garden of Eden on day six after he created man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
GEN	2	8	mokc		גַּן	1	a garden	“a {large} garden” or “a {large} farm/park”. The man lived in this garden and there were animals and many trees and other plants in it too, so it was fairly large. Make sure your translation of this term does not refer to something that is too small.
GEN	2	8	zkg1		בְ⁠עֵ֖דֶן מִ⁠קֶּ֑דֶם	1	in Eden, in the east,	“in {the land/region of/called} Eden, {which was} in/to the east,” or “in the eastern part of {the land/region of/called} Eden,” In this context, “in the east” can refer to (1) the eastern part of the region of Eden (2) a region east of where Moses lived when he wrote this. It is best, if possible, to keep your translation of this phrase general here (like the Hebrew text).
GEN	2	8	x0hj		וַ⁠יָּ֣שֶׂם שָׁ֔ם אֶת הָֽ⁠אָדָ֖ם	1	and there he put the man	“and that is where he put the man” or “and in that garden he put the man” or “That is where he put the man”. Consider whether it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
GEN	2	8	aq1v		אֲשֶׁ֥ר יָצָֽר	1	whom he had formed.	“whom he had shaped/crafted.” or “whom he had created/made.” See how you translated “formed” in verse 7.

Keep that in mind as you translate these terms. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms]])
GEN	2	10	le0l	grammar-connect-words-phrases	וְ⁠נָהָרּ֙ יֹצֵ֣א	1	And a river was going out	“Now a river was flowing” or “A river was flowing” or “There was a river flowing”.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
GEN	2	10	wttv		מֵ⁠עֵ֔דֶן	1	from Eden	“from/through {the land/region of} Eden”. The garden was inside the land of Eden, so as the river flowed through Eden, it watered the garden.

GEN	2	10	v851		יִפָּרֵ֔ד וְ⁠הָיָ֖ה לְ⁠אַרְבָּעָ֥ה רָאשִֽׁים	1	it divided and became four head{water}s.	Verse 10 is ambiguous in the Hebrew text. It could mean (1) “the/that river divided into four {smaller} waters/rivers.” This interpretation means that the river in Eden was the source river that watered the garden and then divided downstream into the four smaller rivers. (2) “there were four {smaller} source rivers that joined together and formed the larger river.” This interpretation means that the four rivers were source headwaters that flowed downstream and joined to form the larger river in Eden. If possible, leave your translation ambiguous here (like the Hebrew text does), so that either interpretation is possible.
GEN	2	11	cohz		שֵׁ֥ם הָֽ⁠אֶחָ֖ד פִּישׁ֑וֹן	1	The name of the first {is}	“The name of the first {river} {is/was}” or “The first {river} is/was named/called” or “The first {river} is/was”. Most translations use past tense in verse 10, but then use present tense throughout verses 11-14. It may be best to use past tense throughout verses 10-14, especially since the rivers and places that are named in these verses no longer existed when Genesis was written, because the Flood completely changed the entire surface of the earth; after the Flood, the names of some of those rivers and places were given to new rivers and places.
GEN	2	11	dv9o	translate-names	פִּישׁ֑וֹן	1	Pishon.	“the Pishon {River}.” Consider whether or not it is natural in your language to use the article (“the”) with the name of a river. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
GEN	2	11	jboq		ה֣וּא הַ⁠סֹּבֵ֗ב	1	It winds through	“It meanders/meandered through” or “which flows/flowed around through”. The word “winds” or “meanders” means that the river changed direction from time to time. Consider whether it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here, or to continue the previous sentence.
GEN	2	11	luyl	translate-names	אֵ֚ת כָּל אֶ֣רֶץ הַֽ⁠חֲוִילָ֔ה	1	all of the land of Havilah,	“the entire/whole region of/called Havilah,” Be consistent in how you translate “land of” throughout this section. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

The meaning of this Hebrew word is not certain. In many translations it is transliterated, that is, spelled the way the Hebrew word is pronounced. It may refer to (1) a fragrant/sweet-smelling tree resin that was used to make perfume; (2) a type of stone or crystal, or possibly pearl. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
GEN	2	12	ta2p	translate-unknown	NO OrigLQuote AVAILABLE!!!	1	and onyx stone	“and {valuable} onyx gemstones” or “and {valuable} stones/gemstones called onyx” or “and {valuable} gemstones”. It is not certain what kind of stone this was, but most Bible scholars think it was onyx, which is a kind of quartz that is often black, but also occurs in many other colors, and can have stripes or bands of white (or other colors) running through it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

GEN	2	14	vqaq	translate-names	אַשּׁ֑וּר	1	Asshur.	“{the land/region of/called} Asshur/Assyria.” This Hebrew name is pronounced “ash-shur” and is spelled “Asshur”, “Ashur”, or “Assyria” in English, depending on the context. This was a region of land, because at that time there were no cities. Most translations have “Assyria” here. Consider again how you translated “the land of” in verses 11 and 13. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
GEN	2	14	s87t		וְ⁠הַ⁠נָּהָ֥ר הָֽ⁠רְבִיעִ֖י פְרָֽת	1	And the fourth river {is}	“{The name of} the fourth river {is/was}” or “The fourth river {is/was named/called}” or “and the fourth river {is/was}”.

In verse 8 it says that God had already put the man in the garden, so the way you translate verse 15 should not sound like he did it again. This information is repeated here to continue the story from verse 8. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
GEN	2	15	knl2	translate-names	בְ⁠גַן עֵ֔דֶן	1	in the Garden of Eden	“in the garden in {the land/region of/called} Eden” or “in Eden Garden”. Notice that “Garden” is capitalized when it is part of a name. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

Make sure it is clear in your translation that God is not contradicting himself here, but rather he is giving an exception to what he said in verse 16. Also consider whether it is better here in your language to continue the sentence from verse 16 or to begin a new sentence. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions]])

GEN	2	19	uzsr	writing-background	וַ⁠יִּצֶר֩ מִן הָֽ⁠אֲדָמָ֗ה	1	had formed from the ground	“had formed/shaped {out of some dust/dirt} from the ground” or “had used {dust/dirt} from the ground to form/shape”. Translate this phrase in a way that makes it clear that this is background information that had already happened.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
GEN	2	19	wnib	translate-names	אֶל הָ֣⁠אָדָ֔ם	1	to the man	“to Adam”. Every translation team needs to decide when to use Adam’s name for the first time in the book of Genesis. The Hebrew word “adam” means “man” and is also Adam’s name; the choice that is not followed here in your translation could be put in a footnote. Some translations first use Adam’s name here in verse 19, when he is naming the animals. Many translations start using his name at the end of verse 20. Still other translations wait until 3:20 when he names Eve, and a few other translations begin in 3:9, 17 or 21. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

GEN	2	21	nhn3		אַחַת֙ מִ⁠צַּלְעֹתָ֔י⁠ו	1	one of his ribs	This phrase is ambiguous in the Hebrew text. It could mean (1) “one of the man’s ribs {from his body/side}” or “a rib {from the man’s body/side}” (2} “part of the man’s side {from his body}”

GEN	2	24	wli4	figs-youdual	וְ⁠הָי֖וּ	1	and they	“so that they”. Some languages have a special dual pronoun for “they” that fits well here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])

Other languages may have a similar idiom. Consider how to best communicate this in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	2	25	nz3m		וַ⁠יִּֽהְי֤וּ שְׁנֵי⁠הֶם֙ עֲרוּמִּ֔ים הָֽ⁠אָדָ֖ם וְ⁠אִשְׁתּ֑⁠וֹ	1	And the man and his wife were both naked,	“Now {at/during that time} both the man and his wife were naked,” or “{At/During that time} the man and his wife did not wear any clothes,”

GEN	3	1	ym03		אֲשֶׁ֥ר עָשָׂ֖ה יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהִ֑ים	1	that Yahweh God had made.	“that Yahweh {who is} God had made/created.” or “that God {whose name is Yahweh) had made/created.” Make sure your translation of this phrase refers to the animals that God had made, not the fields. Also see how you translated “Yahweh God” in chapter 2, beginning in verse 4.
GEN	3	1	ffho	writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר֙	1	And he	“{One day} he” or “{One day} the serpent/snake”. If you use a pronoun (“he”) here in your translation, make sure it refers to the serpent, not God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
GEN	3	4	kr74		וַ⁠יֹּ֥אמֶר הַ⁠נָּחָ֖שׁ	1	But the serpent	“But the snake”. See how you translated “serpent” in verses 1-2.

GEN	3	5	jve8		NO OrigLQuote AVAILABLE!!!	1	that on the day that	“that as soon as”. See how you translated this phrase in Gen 2:17.
GEN	3	5	q2xi	figs-dual	אֲכָלְ⁠כֶ֣ם מִמֶּ֔⁠נּוּ	1	you eat from it,	“you eat {fruit} from that tree,” or “you eat some of that fruit,” The pronouns “you” and “your” are plural in this verse and refer to the man and the woman. Some languages have a special dual pronoun for this. Consider again how you translated “you” and “your” in verses 1-5. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-dual]])
GEN	3	5	oqwg	figs-idiom	וְ⁠נִפְקְח֖וּ עֵֽינֵי⁠כֶ֑ם	0	then your eyes will be opened,	“your mind/understanding will be opened/expanded,” or “you will gain/have new understanding,” or “you will understand/know new things,” Consider whether your language has an idiom like “your eyes will be opened” that would fit well here.

GEN	3	5	o6h2	figs-grammar-connect-logic-result	וִ⁠הְיִיתֶם֙	1	and	“and {as a result}” or “so that”. The following clause is the result of their eyes being opened. Consider the best way to communicate that in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-grammar-connect-logic-result]])

It can mean (1) “God”, as it does everywhere else in the first 30 chapters of Genesis; (2) “gods” or “divine beings"; (3) “angels”. See how you translated “good and evil” in Gen 2:9, 17.
GEN	3	6	vkqt		וַ⁠תֵּ֣רֶא הָֽ⁠אִשָּׁ֡ה כִּ֣י	1	And the woman saw that	“The woman saw/observed that”
GEN	3	6	bq0u	figs-synecdoche	הָ⁠עֵ֨ץ	1	the tree	“the tree {produced fruit that}” or “{the fruit of} that tree” or “the tree{’s fruit}”. The word “tree” refers here to the fruit that is produced by that tree. Make sure that is clear in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

GEN	3	7	c3lx	figs-youdual	וַֽ⁠יִּתְפְּרוּ֙	1	So they sewed	“So they fastened/joined {together}”. The word for “sewed” implies here that some type of needle and thread were used. For example, they may have used a thin, sharpened stick for the needle, and plant fibers for the thread. If necessary, you could use a more general term such as “fastened/joined together” or “connected”. Also, some languages have dual pronouns that can be used in verses 7-8 for “they” and “themselves”. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
GEN	3	7	y99l	translate-unknown	עֲלֵ֣ה תְאֵנָ֔ה	1	fig leaves	“{some} fig {tree} leaves” or “{some} {large} leaves from a fig tree”. Historical facts should not be changed in a translation, including the historical fact that Adam and Eve used fig tree leaves to make aprons. If fig trees are not known in your language area, you could say “{large} leaves from a tree called fig {tree}”. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
GEN	3	7	gesa		וַ⁠יַּעֲשׂ֥וּ לָ⁠הֶ֖ם חֲגֹרֹֽת	1	and made aprons for themselves.	“and used/wore them like/as aprons/skirts/loincloths {to cover their nakedness/bodies}.” or “and wore them around their waists {to cover their nakedness/bodies}.” or “and used them to make clothes for themselves.” These aprons/skirts probably covered them from the waist down to somewhere around the knees.
GEN	3	8	ud2g	writing-pronouns	וַֽ⁠יִּשְׁמְע֞וּ	1	Then they heard	“Then/Later the man and his wife heard”. For some languages it may be clearer and more natural to put the noun phrase “the man and his wife” here and then use a pronoun (“they”) later in this sentence. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	3	8	p41m		אֶת ק֨וֹל יְהוָ֧ה אֱלֹהִ֛ים מִתְהַלֵּ֥ךְ	1	the sound of Yahweh God walking	“the sound of Yahweh God{’s footsteps} as he walked” or “Yahweh God’s voice as he walked”. This phrase can refer to the sound of God’s footsteps or to the sound of his voice. Either meaning fits the context well and is followed by many translations.
GEN	3	8	j0wc		בַּ⁠גָּ֖ן	1	in the garden	“{around} in the garden” or “through the garden”
GEN	3	8	lxgs	figs-idiom	לְ⁠ר֣וּחַ הַ⁠יּ֑וֹם	1	in the breeze of the day,	“{late in the afternoon} in/during the breezy/cool {time} of the day,” or “{late that afternoon/day} when there was a cool breeze blowing,” This idiom refers to the late afternoon or early evening when there is a breeze blowing and it is cooler. For some languages it is more natural to put this time phrase at the beginning of the sentence. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	3	8	o863	writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּתְחַבֵּ֨א הָֽ⁠אָדָ֜ם וְ⁠אִשְׁתּ֗⁠וֹ	1	but the man and his wife	“but/so they”. If you use “the man and his wife” earlier in this verse in your translation, consider whether a pronoun should be used here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	3	8	gvy2		וַ⁠יִּתְחַבֵּ֨א	1	hid	“hid {themselves}” or “{tried to} hide {themselves}”

GEN	3	8	uifw		עֵ֥ץ הַ⁠גָּֽן	1	of the garden.	“in the garden.” or “there.” Since the garden is already mentioned earlier in verse 8, it may be more natural to be general here and say “there”. Do what is best in your language.
GEN	3	9	n617		וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֛א יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	So Yahweh God	“Then/But Yahweh God”. See how you translated this name for God in verses 1 and 8.

Also consider the best way to translate this quote margin in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	3	9	hvfn	figs-yousingular	אַיֶּֽ⁠כָּה	1	“Where {are} you?”	“{Adam,} where are you?” Notice that the word “you” is singular here because God is only addressing the man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
GEN	3	10	oihe	writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֕אמֶר	1	And he said,	“He/Adam answered {him},” or “The man replied,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])

GEN	3	11	a24l	writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֕אמֶר	1	Then he said,	“So Yahweh God asked {him},” Make sure your translation of “he” refers to Yahweh here, not the man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])

Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
GEN	3	12	s3vx		וַ⁠יֹּ֖אמֶר הָֽ⁠אָדָ֑ם	1	Then the man said,	“But the man said/replied {to him},” or “The man answered {him},”

The pronoun “she” is emphatic in the Hebrew text. That, along with the position of “The woman” at the beginning of the sentence, shows that the man is strongly emphasizing his blame on the woman. Translate this clause in your language in a way that will show that emphasis.
GEN	3	12	xhhy		נָֽתְנָה לִּ֥⁠י מִן הָ⁠עֵ֖ץ	1	gave me {fruit} from the tree,	“gave me {some fruit} from that tree,” or “gave me some of the/that fruit,” See how you translated “fruit” in verses 1-6.
GEN	3	12	ixav		וָ⁠אֹכֵֽל	1	and I ate {it}.”	“so I ate {it}.” or “That is why I ate {it/some}.” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

GEN	3	13	nvck		מַה זֹּ֣את עָשִׂ֑ית	1	“What {is} this you have done?”	“What have you done?” or “What did you do?” or “Tell me what you have done.” God already knew the answer to this question, but he is giving the woman a chance to confess and explain what she did. God’s question probably also implies that he is displeased with what has happened.
GEN	3	13	kcit	writing-quotations	וַ⁠תֹּ֨אמֶר֙ הָֽ⁠אִשָּׁ֔ה	0	And the woman said,	“But the woman said/replied {to him},” or “The woman said/replied,” or “She replied,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])

In this context, “cursed” involves God punishing the serpent and its descendants by causing them to suffer by crawling along the ground on their bellies and having a hostile relationship with human beings. Make sure that the way you translate this term does not imply the use of magic. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms]])
GEN	3	14	dyc5		מִ⁠כָּל	1	above	“more {severely/harshly} than”. When Adam and Eve sinned and God judged them, the curse and punishment of death and decay also affected everything that was under their authority, including the animals. Here in Gen 3:14, God puts a more severe curse on the serpent (and his descendants) than he put on the rest of the animals.
GEN	3	14	ssdu		מִ⁠כָּל הַ⁠בְּהֵמָ֔ה	1	all the livestock	“all the domestic/tame animals”. See how you translated “livestock” in Gen 1:24-26; 2:20.

GEN	3	14	se4h		עַל גְּחֹנְ⁠ךָ֣ תֵלֵ֔ךְ	1	You will move on your belly,	“{As a result,} you will/must move/crawl {on/along the ground} on your belly/stomach,”
GEN	3	14	gjbq		וְ⁠עָפָ֥ר תֹּאכַ֖ל	1	and you will eat dust	“and you will/must eat dust/dirt {with your food}”. Make sure your translation of this clause does not imply that dust or dirt is all the snake will eat. Rather it could mean that dirt will get into his mouth when he eats his food, or it could be an idiom that refers to the fact that as he slithers along, his mouth will always be close to the dirt on the ground (a position of humility). Also see how you translated “dust” in Gen 2:7.
GEN	3	14	j3pn		כָּל יְמֵ֥י חַיֶּֽי⁠ךָ	1	all the days of your life.	“your entire life.” or “for as long as you live.”

GEN	3	15	g6a3		ה֚וּא	1	He	“{In fact,} her offspring/descendant” or “{In fact,} one of her descendants”. The pronoun “He” is ambiguous here. It could refer to (1) the woman’s descendant (Jesus) who would one day come to earth as the Messiah/Christ. (2) the woman’s descendants who will constantly be enemies of the snake’s descendants. If you follow the first interpretation, this would be the first prophecy in the Bible about the Messiah/Christ (“the Anointed One” or “the Promised Savior King”) who would come to earth and destroy Satan’s power (Hebrews 2:14). You could include that information in a footnote.
GEN	3	15	nirj	figs-infostructure	יְשׁוּפְ⁠ךָ֣ רֹ֔אשׁ וְ⁠אַתָּ֖ה תְּשׁוּפֶ֥⁠נּוּ עָקֵֽב	1	will strike you {on} the head, and you will strike him {on} the heel.”	“will strike/crush your head, and you will strike/bite/bruise his heel.” This is figurative language that Satan will harm the Messiah, but the Messiah will destroy him. For some languages it is better to switch the order of these clauses and say, “{In fact,} you will strike/bite/bruise the heel of one of her descendants, but he will strike/crush your head.” Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])

Do what is natural in your language. Also consider what is the best way to refer to God here in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

If possible, it is best to keep both parts of the parallelism in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
GEN	3	16	z5ck		וְ⁠אֶל אִישֵׁ⁠ךְ֙ תְּשׁ֣וּקָתֵ֔⁠ךְ וְ⁠ה֖וּא	1	Yet your desire {will be} for your husband, and	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here, because the conjunctions and the idiom “your desire will be for your husband” are all ambiguous in this context. The text can mean (1) “Yet/But you will {still} desire/long {to be with} your husband, and....”, which is similar to what “desire” means in Song of Songs 7:10. (2) “Besides that, you will desire/want {to control} your husband, but....”, which is similar to what “desire” means in Gen 4:7. The interpretation that is not followed in your translation could be put in a footnote.
GEN	3	16	uof4		וְ⁠ה֖וּא יִמְשָׁל בָּֽ⁠ךְ	1	he will rule over you.”	“he will have authority over you.” or “he will control you.” or “he will lord it over you.” See how you translated “rule over” in Gen 1:18. It may be necessary to translate this term differently here because of the negative context of the curse and the consequences of sin.
GEN	3	17	gx48		וּ⁠לְ⁠אָדָ֣ם אָמַ֗ר	1	Then to the man he said,	“Then/Next he/God said to the man,” or “Then/Next Yahweh God {turned} to Adam and said {to him},” In the Hebrew text, “to the man” is emphasized. See how you translated a similar case (“to the woman”) in verse 16. For a note about when to start using Adam’s name in your translation see Gen 2:19.

GEN	3	17	uavx	figs-metonymy	שָׁמַעְתָּ֮ לְ⁠ק֣וֹל אִשְׁתֶּ⁠ךָ֒	0	listened to the voice of your wife	“did what your wife said/suggested” or “did/followed what your wife told you to do”. This phrase means that Adam heard what his wife said to him and then did what she said. Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
GEN	3	17	zzkx		וַ⁠תֹּ֨אכַל֙ מִן הָ⁠עֵ֔ץ	1	and ate from the tree	“and ate {fruit} from the tree”

Also see how you translated this command in verse 3. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
GEN	3	17	u14e	figs-infostructure	אֲרוּרָ֤ה הָֽ⁠אֲדָמָה֙ בַּֽ⁠עֲבוּרֶ֔⁠ךָ	1	the ground is cursed because of you.	“the ground is cursed {by me} because of what you did.” or “I have cursed the ground because you sinned.” For some languages it may be clearer or more natural to break up this long sentence and say, “You did what your wife said and ate {fruit} from the tree that I commanded you not to eat {any fruit} from. Because of what you did, I have cursed the ground.” Also see how you translated “cursed” in verse 14. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])

GEN	3	17	f0nx	figs-infostructure	כֹּ֖ל יְמֵ֥י חַיֶּֽי⁠ךָ	1	all the days of your life.	“every day of your life.” or “for your entire life.” or “for as long as you live.” You could put this clause before the previous clause and say, “{As a result,} for as long as you live, you will have to work {very} hard and suffer...” Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	3	18	xlm8	figs-synecdoche	NO OrigLQuote AVAILABLE!!!	1	And it will produce thorn{s} and thistle{s}	“In fact, the ground will produce/grow thorn {plants} and thistle {plants} {and other weeds}” or “In fact, thornbushes and thistle plants {and other weeds} will grow from the ground”. The thorn and thistle plants represent all types of weeds, which are useless, and possibly harmful, plants. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
GEN	3	18	wft6		NO OrigLQuote AVAILABLE!!!	1	for you, and you will eat the plant{s} of the field{s}.	The Hebrew text here can mean (1) “{and make it difficult} for you to grow {enough} crops in the/your fields for food.” or “so that you will have to work very hard in your fields to grow/produce {enough} crops/food to eat.” (2) “so that {your crops will not grow well and} you will {have to} eat {wild} plants that grow in the {open} fields {to survive}.” That difference of interpretation is caused because the Hebrew word “fields” can refer to land that people cultivate or to uncultivated land where wild plants grow.
GEN	3	19	lf8h	figs-idiom	NO OrigLQuote AVAILABLE!!!	1	By the sweat of your face you will	“You will have to {work hard and} sweat a lot in order to” The phrase “by the sweat of your face/forehead” is an idiom that refers to hard physical labor. Consider whether your languages has a similar idiom. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	3	19	bm5q	figs-idiom	תֹּ֣אכַל לֶ֔חֶם	1	eat bread,	“{grow/produce/have} {enough} food to eat,” Bread was one of the main food staples for that time and culture, so the Hebrew word for “bread” is used here as an idiom that refer to all food, not just bread. Consider whether your language does something similar, using one type of food (such as bread, rice or potatoes) to refer to all food in general. Or you could use a general term like “food”, especially if bread is rare or expensive in your language area. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

The meaning of names is important in the Hebrew language, and this translation issue occurs frequently in the book of Genesis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
GEN	3	20	h1qs		כִּ֛י	1	because	“{He did that} because”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

GEN	3	22	r4u5	writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהִ֗ים	1	Then Yahweh God	“Then he”. Consider whether it is best in your language to use Yahweh’s name or a pronoun in this context. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	3	22	hh9x		וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר	1	said,	said/thought,” or “said/thought {to himself}”. See how you translated a similar quote margin in Gen 1:26, where “said” has the same meaning.
GEN	3	22	lcxy		הֵ֤ן	1	“Behold,	“Look/Listen,” This word expresses emotion and calls attention to what God says next. See how you translated this term in Gen 1:29.
GEN	3	22	x8l5		הָֽ⁠אָדָם֙	1	the man	“the man {and his wife}” or “man{kind}” or “human beings”. Throughout verses 22-24 “the man” represents mankind, which included both the man and the woman at this point. Make sure your translation communicates that clearly in those verses and does not just refer to Adam.
GEN	3	22	v481	figs-exclusive	הָיָה֙ כְּ⁠אַחַ֣ד מִמֶּ֔⁠נּוּ	1	has become like one of us	“have become like one of us” or “have become like us”. The pronoun “us” is inclusive because God is talking to himself. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
GEN	3	22	bwkx		לָ⁠דַ֖עַת ט֣וֹב וָ⁠רָ֑ע	1	in knowing good and evil.	“so that they know {what is} good and {what is} evil.” See how you translated this phrase in verse 5, and a similar phrase in Gen 2:9.

Consider the best way to translate this passive clause in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
GEN	3	22	mngq		יִשְׁלַ֣ח יָד֗⁠וֹ וְ⁠לָקַח֙ גַּ֚ם מֵ⁠עֵ֣ץ הַֽ⁠חַיִּ֔ים וְ⁠אָכַ֖ל	1	reach out his hand and also take {fruit} from the tree of life and eat it	“also take/pick and eat fruit from the tree of {eternal} life,” or “also eat fruit from the tree that gives people {eternal} life,” See how you translated “took/picked fruit” in verse 6, and how you translated “the tree of life” in Gen 2:9.
GEN	3	22	u5o4		וָ⁠חַ֥י לְ⁠עֹלָֽם	1	and live forever!”	“and {then/so} live forever!” or “which will/would make them live forever!”
GEN	3	23	dkrk		וַֽ⁠יְשַׁלְּחֵ֛⁠הוּ יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	So Yahweh God	“Then Yahweh God” or “So {then} Yahweh God”. Consider again how you translated “Yahweh God” in Genesis 2 and 3, and see the note about this at Gen 2:4.
GEN	3	23	monu		וַֽ⁠יְשַׁלְּחֵ֛⁠הוּ מִ⁠גַּן	1	sent him out of	“forced them to leave” or “expelled/banished the man {and his wife} from”. Notice that in verses 22-24, “the man”, “him”, and “he” refer to mankind, that is, the man and the woman. Make sure it is clear in your translation here that both of them were sent out of the garden, not just the man. Some languages have dual pronouns that are used for “they” and “them” in verses 22-24.
GEN	3	23	k5at		מִ⁠גַּן עֵ֑דֶן	1	the Garden of Eden	“the garden in {the land/region of/called} Eden” or “Eden Garden”. See how you translated this phrase in Gen 2:15.
GEN	3	23	bkyh		לַֽ⁠עֲבֹד֙ אֶת הָ֣⁠אֲדָמָ֔ה	1	to work the ground	“to work/farm/cultivate the ground/land/soil”. See how you translated “work the ground” in Gen 2:5 and “work it” in 2:15.
GEN	3	23	kgd1		אֲשֶׁ֥ר לֻקַּ֖ח מִ⁠שָּֽׁם	1	which he had been taken from.	“which they had been taken/created from {by him/God}.” or “which God/he had taken/made them from.” It does not refer to the exact ground that he was made from. See how you translated “taken from” in verse 19.
GEN	3	24	e3ea		וַ⁠יְגָ֖רֶשׁ	1	And after	“Then after” or “After”
GEN	3	24	oh7l		וַ⁠יְגָ֖רֶשׁ אֶת הָֽ⁠אָדָ֑ם	1	he drove the man out,	“he/Yahweh/God drove/forced the man {and his wife} out {of the garden},” or “he/Yahweh/God expelled/banished them {from the garden},”
GEN	3	24	s979		וַ⁠יַּשְׁכֵּן֩	1	then he placed	“then he stationed” or “he placed/stationed”
GEN	3	24	fhju		מִ⁠קֶּ֨דֶם לְ⁠גַן עֵ֜דֶן	1	on the east side of the Garden of Eden	“on/to the east {side} of the garden {at its entrance}” or “{at the entrance} of/to the garden, {which was} on its east side”. It is implied that the entrance to the garden is where the cherubim were placed to keep everyone from ever entering the garden again. Consider again how you translated “garden” in Gen 2:8-10, 15-16; 3:1-3, 8, 10, 23-24.
GEN	3	24	gblx	translate-unknown	אֶת הַ⁠כְּרֻבִ֗ים	1	cherubim {angels}	“{some} {powerful} cherubim {angels}” or “{some} {powerful beings called} cherubim {angels}”. Most translations transliterate or borrow this term from Hebrew throughout the Bible. Cherubim are a special category of very powerful angels. Each one has four faces: a human face, a lion’s face, a bull’s face and an eagle’s face (Ezekiel 1:10; 10:14). Each of them also has multiple wings. You could include some of that information in a footnote. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
GEN	3	24	g6ti		וְ⁠אֵ֨ת לַ֤הַט הַ⁠חֶ֨רֶב֙	1	and a flaming sword	“and a blazing/fiery/burning sword” or “and a sword made of flames”. A sword is a weapon that has a very long, sharp (often two-sided) blade that is longer than a knife, machete, or dagger and is attached to a hilt or handle. This sword may have had flames coming from it, or this may have been fire in the shape of a sword.
GEN	3	24	xhv3		הַ⁠מִּתְהַפֶּ֔כֶת	1	turning in every direction	“that was turning/swinging around in all directions” or “that was swinging/flashing back and forth”. It seems that the sword was swinging by itself since there is no mention of anyone holding it.
GEN	3	24	y07z		לִ⁠שְׁמֹ֕ר אֶת דֶּ֖רֶךְ	1	to guard the way of	“to keep everyone away from the way/path {that leads/goes} to” or “so that no one could get/go near”
GEN	3	24	hc03		עֵ֥ץ הַֽ⁠חַיִּֽים	1	the tree of life.	“the tree of {eternal} life.” or “the tree whose fruit gives people {eternal} life.” or “the tree whose fruit makes people live {forever}.” See how you translated this phrase in Gen 2:9 and 3:22.
GEN	4	1	t3up		וְ⁠הָ֣⁠אָדָ֔ם	1	Then the man	“Then Adam” or “Then the man {Adam}”. For a note about when to begin referring to the man as Adam, see Gen 2:19.
GEN	4	1	uvfo	figs-euphemism	יָדַ֖ע אֶת חַוָּ֣ה אִשְׁתּ֑⁠וֹ	1	knew Eve his wife,	“had {marital} relations with his wife Eve,” or “slept with his wife Eve,” or “was intimate with his wife Eve,” This phrase is a Hebrew idiom that means Adam had marital/sexual relations with Eve. Many languages have a similar idiom. Make sure you translate this in a way that is polite and will not offend or embarrass people, especially when read aloud. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
GEN	4	1	fv9x		וַ⁠תַּ֨הַר֙	1	and she	“so that she” or “with the result that she”
GEN	4	1	mw1s		וַ⁠תַּ֨הַר֙ וַ⁠תֵּ֣לֶד	1	conceived and bore	“became pregnant and {later} gave birth to”. Translate this term in a way that will not embarrass people, especially when read aloud.
GEN	4	1	frp9		אֶת קַ֔יִן	1	Cain.	“{a son they named} Cain{, which means “obtained/acquired"}.” You could include the meaning of Cain’s name in your translation or in a footnote. See what you did for a similar case in Gen 3:20.
GEN	4	1	qyrc		וַ⁠תֹּ֕אמֶר	1	And she said,	“because she said/exclaimed,” or “{They named him that} because she/Eve had said/exclaimed,” This sentence explains how Cain got his name. Make sure that is clear in your translation.
GEN	4	1	ars9		קָנִ֥יתִי	1	“I have obtained	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) “I have obtained/acquired” (2) “I have produced/created”. If you include the meaning of Cain’s name earlier in this verse in your translation or in a footnote, make sure it matches your choice here, so that it is clear why he was given that name.
GEN	4	1	mihf		אִ֖ישׁ	1	a man	“a male child” or “a boy/son” or “a baby boy”. For some languages it is confusing to refer to a newborn baby as a man. Do what is clear and natural in your language.
GEN	4	1	wkk0	figs-infostructure	אֶת יְהוָֽה	1	with Yahweh!”	“with {help from} Yahweh!” or “with Yahweh{’s help}!” For some languages it is more natural to put this phrase earlier in this sentence and say, “With Yahweh’s help I have obtained/acquired a son!” or “Yahweh has enabled/helped me to obtain/get a son!” Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	4	2	dofm	writing-pronouns	וַ⁠תֹּ֣סֶף	1	Then she	“Then she/Eve” or “After that she/Eve”. Consider whether it is better in your language to use a pronoun or a noun to refer to Eve here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	4	2	c17g	translate-kinship	וַ⁠תֹּ֣סֶף לָ⁠לֶ֔דֶת אֶת אָחִ֖י⁠ו	1	continued on to bear his brother	“also gave birth to his/Cain’s brother” or “gave birth to another baby boy, {who was} his/Cain’s brother”. The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. Cain and Abel may have been twins, or Abel may have been born sometime later after Eve became pregnant again. If possible, translate verse 2 in a way that allows for either interpretation. Also, if your language has a specific term for “younger brother”, you could use it here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
GEN	4	2	hs6k		אֶת הָ֑בֶל	1	Abel.	“{whom they named} Abel.” or “{whose name was} Abel.”
GEN	4	2	kjvd	grammar-connect-time-background	וַֽ⁠יְהִי הֶ֨בֶל֙	1	Now Abel	“Now {when the boys had grown up,} Abel” or “{When they grew up,} Abel”. This sentence introduces background information for what happens next. Consider the best way to begin this sentence in your language. Also, It is implied here that the boys had grown up to be adults. If necessary, you could make that explicit in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
GEN	4	2	gk2q		NO OrigLQuote AVAILABLE!!!	1	became a keeper of flock{s},	“became/was a keeper/herder of flocks/sheep,” or “became/was a shepherd,” or “raised sheep {and goats},” A flock can be a large group of sheep or of goats, or a mixture of both.
GEN	4	2	awqr	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וְ⁠קַ֕יִן	1	and Cain	“whereas/but Cain”. Consider the best way in your language to contrast Cain and his work with Abel and his work. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
GEN	4	2	egz0		הָיָ֖ה עֹבֵ֥ד אֲדָמָֽה	1	became a worker of the ground.	“became/was a worker/tiller/farmer of the ground/soil.” or “became/was a {crop} farmer.” or “grew {food} crops.” Cain raised crops, not animals. See how you translated a similar phrase (“work the ground”) in Gen 2:5.
GEN	4	3	fxnz	writing-newevent	וַֽ⁠יְהִ֖י מִ⁠קֵּ֣ץ יָמִ֑ים וַ⁠יָּבֵ֨א	1	And it happened in the course of days that	“Then one day it happened that” or “As time went on/by, one day”. These phrases introduce an important new event. Consider the best way to do that in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
GEN	4	3	m3w6		וַ⁠יָּבֵ֨א קַ֜יִן	1	Cain brought	“Cain offered/gave”
GEN	4	3	yfo1		מִ⁠פְּרִ֧י	1	some of the fruit	“some of the crops” or “some of the edible plants”. The word “fruit” is general here and refers to any edible plant or crop that grows as the result of being cultivated. Make sure that is clear in your translation.
GEN	4	3	aziq		מִ⁠פְּרִ֧י הָֽ⁠אֲדָמָ֛ה	1	of the ground	“{that he had harvested} from his farmland/fields” or “{that he had raised/grown} in his fields”

GEN	4	4	elk6		וְ⁠הֶ֨בֶל הֵבִ֥יא גַם	1	And Abel also brought	“Abel also brought/offered/gave {an offering/gift/sacrifice} {to Yahweh}, {but what he offered/gave was}” or “But Abel offered/gave {to Yahweh}”. There is a contrast between Abel and Cain and between their offerings.
GEN	4	4	hg3v		NO OrigLQuote AVAILABLE!!!	1	the firstborn of his flock{s}	“the firstborn {animals} from his flock{s}/sheep”. See how you translated “flocks” in verse 2.
GEN	4	4	eb5p		וּ⁠מֵֽ⁠חֶלְבֵ⁠הֶ֑ן	1	and some of their fat.	“and/including some of the fat portions of the meat.” or “and/including some of their best parts.” or “and/including the fattest/best parts of the animals/meat.” In that culture, fat was considered one of the best parts of an animal to eat. If that is different from how fat is viewed in your language area, that information could be put in a footnote.
GEN	4	4	sqrg		וַ⁠יִּ֣שַׁע יְהוָ֔ה אֶל	1	And Yahweh looked {favorably} on	“Yahweh was pleased/happy with” or “Yahweh accepted”

GEN	4	5	mh9w		וְ⁠אֶל קַ֥יִן לֹ֣א שָׁעָ֑ה	1	did not look {favorably} on Cain	“was not pleased/happy with Cain” or “did not accept Cain”. See how you translated “looked {favorably} on” in verse 4.
GEN	4	5	fvz7		וְ⁠אֶל מִנְחָת֖⁠וֹ	1	and his offering.	“and/or his gift/sacrifice.” or “and/or what he offered/gave {to him}.”
GEN	4	5	ffej	figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּ֤חַר לְ⁠קַ֨יִן֙ מְאֹ֔ד	1	So Cain burned with intense anger,	“So Cain was/became/felt extremely angry,” Many languages have a similar idiom that fits well here. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	4	5	c4os	figs-idiom	וַֽ⁠יִּפְּל֖וּ פָּנָֽי⁠ו	1	and his face fell.	“and his face showed that he was angry/upset.” or “and he frowned/scowled.” or “and his face showed it.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	4	6	uu0g	writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֥אמֶר יְהוָ֖ה אֶל קָ֑יִן	1	Then Yahweh said to Cain,	“Then Yahweh asked Cain/him,” The way you translate this quote margin should fit with the way that you translated the following three rhetorical questions. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	4	6	k5bq	figs-rquestion	לָ֚⁠מָּה חָ֣רָה לָ֔⁠ךְ וְ⁠לָ֖⁠מָּה נָפְל֥וּ פָנֶֽי⁠ךָ	1	“Why are you burning with anger? And why is your face fallen?	“Why are you so angry? And why are you frowning/scowling?” or “There is no need/reason for you to be angry and frowning/scowling.” God is using these rhetorical questions to correct Cain. Consider the best way to communicate that in your language. Also see how you translated the idioms “burned with...anger” and “face fell” in verse 5. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
GEN	4	7	poji		אִם תֵּיטִיב֙	1	If you do right,	“If you do {what is} right,”

Consider the best way to do that in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
GEN	4	7	geuj		וְ⁠אִם֙ לֹ֣א תֵיטִ֔יב	1	But if you do not do right,	“But if you don't do {what is} right,” or “But if you do what is wrong,”

In verse 7 sin is personified, that is, it is treated as if it were alive, like a lion or some other fierce animal that wants to attack Cain. Some languages can do the same thing.

Instead of that text, some ancient manuscripts (including the Samaritan Pentateuch, Septuagint, Latin Vulgate and Syriac) and many modern translations have: “Then Cain said to Abel his brother, “Let’s go out to the field {and work} {together}.” ” or “Then Cain invited/asked his brother Abel to go out to the field with him {to work}.” Some translation teams follow the way this verse is translated in a well-known translation, such as in the national language or in a neighboring language. Decide what to do in your translation. The textual variant that you do not use in your translation could be put in a footnote. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])

If it is not possible to do that in your language, you could say that his brother’s blood is “like a voice...”, or you could translate this sentence without personification.

Usually translators transliterate (copy or borrow) the name from the Hebrew text, and they might also include the meaning of the name in the text or in a footnote. If you do that here, the meaning should be similar to how you translated “wanderer” in verses 12 and 14. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
GEN	4	16	c6wv		קִדְמַת עֵֽדֶן	1	east of Eden.	“{which was} east of {the land/region of/called} Eden.” or “{which was} east of Eden {Land}.” Consider again how you translated “{the land/region of} Eden” and “the Garden of Eden” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 2:8, 10, 15; 3:23-24; 4:16.

It can mean: (1) “I killed a man for wounding me; {he was} a young man who bruised/injured me!” or “I killed a young man for wounding/injuring me! In fact, I killed that man for {just} bruising me!” (2) “I killed a man for wounding me, and also a young man for bruising/injuring me.” or “A man wounded me, so I killed him. A young man injured me, so I killed him too!” In the first interpretation, Lamech refers to one man he killed. In the second interpretation, he refers to two men he killed.
GEN	4	24	ak6f	figs-activepassive	כִּ֥י שִׁבְעָתַ֖יִם יֻקַּם קָ֑יִן וְ⁠לֶ֖מֶךְ	1	If Cain is avenged seven times, then	“Since {God has promised} to avenge Cain seven times, then” or “Cain is avenged {by God} seven times, but” or “God will avenge Cain seven times, but”. Consider what is the best way to translate this passive clause in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
GEN	4	24	un81		וְ⁠לֶ֖מֶךְ שִׁבְעִ֥ים וְ⁠שִׁבְעָֽה	1	Lamech {is avenged} seventy-seven times!”	“I, Lamech avenge myself seventy-seven times!” or “I avenge myself 77 times!” Lamech is bragging in verses 23 and 24 about how severely he avenges himself. He is not saying that God will avenge him more than he will avenge Cain. Be consistent with how you spelled the name “Lamech” in verses 18-19, 23-24.

Make sure that is clear in your language. Also consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	4	25	vsor		שָֽׁת לִ֤⁠י אֱלֹהִים֙	1	“God has appointed for me	“God has granted/given to me”. If you include the meaning of Seth’s name in your translation or in a footnote, make sure it matches the way you translate “appointed” here, so that it is clear why he was given that name.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	4	26	wco1		וּ⁠לְ⁠שֵׁ֤ת גַּם יֻלַּד בֵּ֔ן	1	And to Seth also a son was born,	“{Later on,} Seth also fathered/had a son,” The word order in the Hebrew text here emphasizes Seth. Do what is natural in your language.
GEN	4	26	vsiv		וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֥א אֶת שְׁמ֖⁠וֹ אֱנ֑וֹשׁ	1	and he called his name Enosh.	“and he named him Enosh.” or “whom he named Enosh.”

It also implies that they were trusting in him to help and guide them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	5	1	ethn		זֶ֣ה	1	This {is}	“Here {is}” or “What follows {is}”

GEN	5	1	e3dh		בִּ⁠דְמ֥וּת אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	in the likeness of God.	“in his own likeness.” or “to be like himself.” God created mankind to be like himself in certain ways, not to be exactly like him in every way (Gen 1:26-27).
GEN	5	2	og34		זָכָ֥ר וּ⁠נְקֵבָ֖ה בְּרָאָ֑⁠ם	1	He created them male and female,	“He {also} created them {to be} male and female,” See how you translated this clause in Gen 1:27.
GEN	5	2	pr0w		וַ⁠יְבָ֣רֶךְ אֹתָ֗⁠ם	1	and he blessed them	“He blessed them”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Also see how you translated “blessed” in Gen 1:22, 28. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.
GEN	5	2	yasr		וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֤א אֶת שְׁמָ⁠ם֙	1	and called their name	“and called/named them”. See how you translated the phrase “called...name” in Gen 4:17, 25, 26.

For some languages it is clearer or more natural to put this clause earlier in this verse and say, “and on the {same} day {that} he created them, he blessed them and called/named them human beings.” Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	5	3	tgwv	translate-numbers	וַֽ⁠יְחִ֣י אָדָ֗ם שְׁלֹשִׁ֤ים וּ⁠מְאַת֙ שָׁנָ֔ה וַ⁠יּ֥וֹלֶד	1	And Adam lived 130 years, then he fathered a son	“When Adam had lived 130 years, he fathered/had a son” or “When Adam was 130 years old, he fathered/had a son”. Each translation team needs to decide how they are going to write large numbers in the Bible. Many teams use numerals, for example, “130” here in verse 3, especially if the target language has a complicated counting system. Other teams prefer to use words, for example, “one hundred thirty” here. Be consistent in what you do throughout your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])
GEN	5	3	r0h5	figs-doublet	בִּ⁠דְמוּת֖⁠וֹ כְּ⁠צַלְמ֑⁠וֹ	1	in his own likeness, according to his image,	“who was {a human being} like himself and looked like him,” or “who was like him in many ways,” These two phrases have similar meanings and emphasize that Seth was similar to Adam in many ways. See how you translated similar phrases in Gen 1:26. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
GEN	5	3	pecn		וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֥א אֶת שְׁמ֖⁠וֹ שֵֽׁת	1	and he called his name Seth.	“and he/Adam named him Seth.” or “Adam named his/that son Seth.” For some languages it is more natural to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language.

Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
GEN	5	5	j8tt	translate-names	וַ⁠יִּֽהְי֞וּ כָּל יְמֵ֤י אָדָם֙ אֲשֶׁר חַ֔י	1	So all the days of Adam that he lived were 930 years,	“So Adam lived a total of 930 years,” or “All together Adam lived 930 years,” Make sure that the name “Adam” is spelled consistently in your translation of verses 1, 3-5. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

So if you use a conjunction here, make sure your translation does not sound like verse 6 happened after Adam died. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
GEN	5	6	uji9	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יּ֖וֹלֶד אֶת אֱנֽוֹשׁ	1	he fathered Enosh.	“he fathered/had {a son named} Enosh.” or “he fathered/had {a son he/they named} Enosh.” or “he fathered/had {a son whose name was} Enosh.” You could make it explicit in your translation or in a footnote that Enosh was a son. The same thing is true for the rest of the children who were born in this chapter (who were all sons). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	5	7	pgoo	writing-pronouns	וַֽ⁠יְחִי שֵׁ֗ת אַֽחֲרֵי֙ הוֹלִיד֣⁠וֹ אֶת אֱנ֔וֹשׁ	1	Then after he fathered Enosh, Seth lived	“After he/Seth had Enosh, Seth/he lived” or “After Enosh’s birth, Seth lived” or “After Enosh was born, Seth lived”. If you use a pronoun (“he”) in this sentence in your translation, make sure it refers to Seth. In fact, throughout chapter 5, make sure it is clear in your translation whom each pronoun refers to. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

GEN	6	1	yp4k	grammar-connect-time-background	וַֽ⁠יְהִי֙	1	And	“Now”. The events in Gen 6:1-2 started happening long before the events in 5:32, so the way your translation begins this verse should allow for that meaning and not begin with a sequence word like “Then”, which would have the wrong meaning here. Many translations omit the conjunction here. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
GEN	6	1	knal	writing-background	וַֽ⁠יְהִי֙ כִּֽי	1	it happened when	“it happened that when/as” or “it happened that”.

For many languages it is necessary to divide it into two or more shorter sentences. For example, depending on how you began verse one, you could begin verse 2 with a new sentence. Do what is best in your language.
GEN	6	2	ouqe		בְנֵי הָֽ⁠אֱלֹהִים֙	1	the sons of God	“{some} angels” or “{some} supernatural beings”. The meaning of Gen 6:2 is not certain and is heavily debated, so it is probably best to translate it fairly literally and possibly include a footnote about what it means. If it is not translated literally, the literal text should be put in a footnote. There are three main views of who “the sons of God” and “the daughters of mankind” refer to: (1) nonhuman, god-like beings (supernatural beings), such as angels (as in Job 1:6, 38:7) or demons who took human form and married the daughters of human beings; 1 Peter 3:19 - 20; 2 Peter 2:4 [HYPERLINK: https://www.esv.org/2%20Pet.%202%3A4/], and Jude 6 [HYPERLINK: https://www.esv.org/Jude%206/] may be referring to this passage. (2) male descendants of Seth (the righteous, chosen family line) who married female descendants of Cain (the unrighteous family line). (3) sons of powerful men, such as judges or rulers (as in Exodus 22:8, Psalm 82:1, 6) who married the daughters of common, poor people.
GEN	6	2	rww0		וַ⁠יִּרְא֤וּ אֶת בְּנ֣וֹת הָֽ⁠אָדָ֔ם כִּ֥י טֹבֹ֖ת הֵ֑נָּה	1	saw the daughters of mankind, that they {were} beautiful,	“saw that the daughters of human beings {were} beautiful,” or “saw that those young women {were} beautiful,” or “saw that they {were} {very} beautiful,”

Also, see how you translated “took/married” in Gen 4:19.
GEN	6	3	udrx	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר יְהוָ֗ה	1	Then Yahweh said,	“Then/So Yahweh said {to himself},” Only make implied information explicit in your translation if it is necessary to prevent wrong meaning or if your language’s grammar requires it, so that your translation is easier to read and understand. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	6	3	j55w		רוּחִ֤⁠י	1	“My Spirit	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean (1) “My Spirit” or “I”, which is a way of God referring to himself (Gen 1:2 is similar). (2) “My spirit”, which could refer to God’s breath that gives life (as in Gen 2:7). If the text is not translated literally, the literal text should be put in a footnote.
GEN	6	3	g0yz		לֹֽא יָד֨וֹן	1	will not	“will no longer”
GEN	6	3	n105		יָד֨וֹן בָֽ⁠אָדָם֙	1	strive with	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean: (1) “strive/contend with” or “put up with” man’s rebellion; (2) “remain/live with/in”. The interpretation that is not used in your translation could be put in a footnote.
GEN	6	3	knwu		בָֽ⁠אָדָם֙	1	mankind	“human beings” or “people”
GEN	6	3	lwj4	figs-infostructure	לְ⁠עֹלָ֔ם	1	forever,	“always,” It may be more natural to put this term earlier in this sentence and say, “My Spirit will not always strive with mankind,” Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	6	3	v37h	figs-idiom	בְּ⁠שַׁ⁠גַּ֖ם ה֣וּא בָשָׂ֑ר	1	because they {are} indeed flesh.	“because they {are} certainly/very sinful/corrupt.” or “because they {are} only/mere {sinful/corrupt} mortals.” The word “flesh” is used here as an idiom that means human beings are “mortal” (that is, their bodies will die) and that they are “sinful/corrupt”. The two meanings are interrelated since it is because of sin that their bodies die. In this context, the focus is on their corrupt behavior, which is the reason God will send a flood soon. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	6	3	se27		וְ⁠הָי֣וּ	1	Therefore	“So”. Many translations leave this word out. Do what is natural in your language.
GEN	6	3	udiw		וְ⁠הָי֣וּ יָמָ֔י⁠ו מֵאָ֥ה וְ⁠עֶשְׂרִ֖ים שָׁנָֽה	1	their days will be 120 years.”	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) “they will have 120 years {to repent}.” or “I will give them 120 years {to repent}.” (2) “{from now on,} they/people will have/live {no longer than} 120 years.” The first interpretation seems to best fit the context of God announcing his plan to judge mankind for their sin (verse 7). This would mean that Noah was 480 years old when God said this (about 20 years before he started having sons; Gen 5:32), since the flood came when he was 600 years old (Gen 7:6); you could put some of that information in a footnote. The second interpretation does not fit with the fact that after God said this, many people lived much longer than 120 years, so it does not seem likely that length of life was his meaning here.
GEN	6	4	i2uj	translate-names	הַ⁠נְּפִלִ֞ים	1	The Nephilim	“{People called} the Nephilim” or “Giants”. Most translations transliterate (borrow or copy) the Hebrew word “Nephilim” here. The word means “fallen ones” and probably refers to their fallen (sinful) spiritual state. The Nephilim were the descendants of the sons of God and the daughters of mankind. The only other place in the Bible that the Nephilim are mentioned is centuries later in Numbers 13:32-33, where they are identified as evil giants. Based on that, some translations translate “the Nephilim” as “giants” here in Gen 6:4. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])

GEN	6	5	gbkz	figs-idiom	וַ⁠יַּ֣רְא יְהוָ֔ה	1	And Yahweh saw	“Yahweh knew” or “Yahweh was aware”. The verb “saw” is used here as an idiom. Consider whether your language has a similar idiom that would fit well here. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

It can mean (1) “He {alone} was blameless/faultless {in God’s eyes} among his contemporaries.” or “Out of all the people living at that time, Noah/he was the only one {whom God considered} blameless.” (2) “He had a blameless/spotless reputation among his contemporaries. or “His contemporaries considered him to be a man of integrity.” The phrase “without blemish” is often used in the Bible to describe animals that have no defects. Here it is used as an idiom that means Noah was “blameless/faultless” in an ethical or moral sense, or that he had good integrity, but it does not mean that he was sinless. Consider whether your language has a similar idiom that would work well here. Also the word “generation” refers to people who live during the same time period.

GEN	6	11	sber	figs-parallelism	וַ⁠תִּמָּלֵ֥א הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ חָמָֽס	1	and the earth was filled {with} violence.	“and they had filled the earth with {their} violence/lawlessness.” or “and all over the earth they were doing violent/lawless things.” This clause forms a parallelism with the previous clause in order to emphasize how evil the people on the earth had become. The two clauses are different enough from each other that, if possible, it is best to keep both parts of the parallelism in your translation. Also be consistent with how you translated “the earth” earlier in this verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
GEN	6	12	rr15		וַ⁠יַּ֧רְא אֱלֹהִ֛ים	1	And God saw	“God saw”. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin this sentence with a conjunction.

The phrase “all flesh” refers here to all people and probably implies that people are mortal (verse 3). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

GEN	6	14	nc27	translate-transliterate	תֵּבַ֣ת	1	an ark	“a {very} large boat/houseboat”. The term “ark” is general and refers to a chest/box that is closed on all sides, including the top. In this case, the ark was a very large boat that people and many animals lived in for a year. It had no motor, no oars, no sail and no rudder. Since this was a unique, one-of-a-kind boat that may already be well-known as the “ark” in the receptor language area, some translations transliterate (copy or borrow) the word “ark” throughout Genesis. Decide what is best for your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])

Some Bible scholars think it was cypress wood. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
GEN	6	14	kbce		קִנִּ֖ים תַּֽעֲשֶׂ֣ה אֶת הַ⁠תֵּבָ֑ה	1	Make the ark {with} rooms,	“Build/Construct the ark/boat with compartments/stalls {inside},” or “Make/Build rooms inside the ark/boat,”

GEN	6	14	oojq		בַּ⁠כֹּֽפֶר	1	with a covering.	“with pitch/tar {to keep water out}.” or “with pitch/tar {to keep the boat from leaking}.” The Hebrew word “covering” is general and does not specify what kind of waterproofing material is being used. However, many translations are more specific than that here and refer to “pitch” or “tar” or some other material made from tree resin or sap that can seal a boat well and keep it from leaking.
GEN	6	15	w3u0		וְ⁠זֶ֕ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר תַּֽעֲשֶׂ֖ה אֹתָ֑⁠הּ	1	And this {is} how you must make it:	“Build the ark/boat with these dimensions/measurements:” or “You must make/build the ark/boat like this:”

You can (1) translate cubits into meters or feet, and put the literal text in a footnote; or (2) keep “cubits” in the main text (so that the numbers 300, 50 and 30 are kept) and put what that equals in meters or feet in a footnote. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bdistance]])

See the note about “cubit” in verse 15. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bdistance]])

In the Hebrew text, the pronoun “I” is emphatic, both by its form and by its position at the beginning of the sentence. If it is clear and natural in your language, keep that emphasis in your translation of this clause. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])
GEN	6	17	vhso		לְ⁠שַׁחֵ֣ת	1	to destroy	“{in order} to destroy” or “which will destroy”. See how you translated “destroy” in verse 13.
GEN	6	17	mtax		כָּל בָּשָׂ֗ר	1	all flesh	“all the creatures/beings” or “every creature” or “every living thing”. This phrase is general here and includes people and animals, so you may need to translate the phrase differently here from what you did earlier in verses 12-13 (where the focus seems to be on people).
GEN	6	17	z89g		אֲשֶׁר בּ⁠וֹ֙ ר֣וּחַ חַיִּ֔ים	1	that {has} the breath of life in it	“that breathe/breathes {air}”. See how you translated this phrase in Gen 1:30.

Consider whether your language has a similar or different idiom that would work well here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	6	18	o9e9	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וַ⁠הֲקִמֹתִ֥י	1	But I will establish	“But/However I will make/institute” or “But/However I will set up”. The word “establish” means to deliberately and formally put something into effect. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])

The word “testament” is another word for “covenant,” so the way you translate “covenant” here could be similar to the way you translate the titles “Old Testament” and “New Testament.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms]])

It may be necessary to include a footnote that explains the concept of clean and unclean animals: In the Bible a “clean animal” was an animal that was acceptable to be sacrificed to God or to be eaten, and an “unclean animal” was one that could not be sacrificed or eaten; it does not refer to how clean the animal was physically. Later Moses wrote down the laws about clean and unclean animals in the book of Leviticus.

It could mean (1) “including every {kind of} creature/animal that moves/lives on land” or “which includes every {kind of} creature/animal that moves/lives on land”. According to this interpretation, the rest of verse 8 emphasizes that the clean and unclean animals and birds (verses 2-3, 8) were all creatures that lived on land (which are the creatures that the flood affected). (2) “as well as every {kind of} creature/animal that crawls/creeps along the ground”. According to this interpretation, the rest of verse 8 refers to a fourth category of creatures besides the clean animals, unclean animals, and birds.

For languages such as English that do not assign grammatical gender to nouns, it is more accurate to use “its” and “it” here, because it is not known whether this dove was male or female.

GEN	8	14	n6se		יָבְשָׁ֖ה	1	was dry.	“had dried off.” In this context “dry” means that the ground was dry enough to walk on and live on without getting stuck in mud. Make sure your translation does not imply that it was so dry that nothing would grow on it (like a desert).

It can mean (1) “and every {other} creature/animal that moves/lives”, which seems to fit this context best since it is general and includes all the land animals that were not birds or livestock. (2) “and every creature/animal that crawls”, which is more specific and refers to animals like lizards, snakes, mice, and other animals that have bodies that are close to the ground.

GEN	8	20	jhtp		וַ⁠יִּקַּ֞ח	1	and he	“Then/Next he”. Consider whether it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
GEN	8	20	lz7b		וַ⁠יִּקַּ֞ח מִ⁠כֹּ֣ל הַ⁠בְּהֵמָ֣ה הַ⁠טְּהוֹרָ֗ה וּ⁠מִ⁠כֹּל֙ הָ⁠ע֣וֹף הַ⁠טָּהֹ֔ר	1	took from every clean animal and from every clean bird,	“selected/chose {some/one} from/of every {kind of} clean/pure animal and {some/one of} every {kind of} clean/pure bird,” or “selected/chose {some/one} from/of every {kind of} animal and bird that are acceptable to sacrifice”. In the Bible, a “clean” animal or bird is one that is acceptable to be sacrificed to God or eaten; it does not refer to how clean the animal or bird was physically. See how you translated this term in Gen 7:2, 8.
GEN	8	20	io25	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יַּ֥עַל עֹלֹ֖ת בַּ⁠מִּזְבֵּֽחַ	1	and offered burnt offerings on the altar.	“and he {killed them and} offered/sacrificed them as burnt offerings {to Yahweh} on the altar.” or “and he {killed them and} burned {their bodies} on the altar as offerings/gifts {to Yahweh} {to worship/honor/thank him}.” Notice that animals were not burned alive, but were killed first. Consider whether or not you need to make that information explicit in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	8	21	qtiq		וַ⁠יָּ֣רַח יְהוָה֮ אֶת רֵ֣יחַ הַ⁠נִּיחֹחַ֒	1	And Yahweh smelled the pleasant aroma,	“Yahweh smelled the pleasant/sweet aroma/smell {of the sacrifices},” or “When Yahweh smelled the aroma {of the sacrifices}, he was pleased,”
GEN	8	21	f7y0	writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר יְהוָ֜ה	1	and Yahweh	“and/so he”. Consider what is the best way to refer to Yahweh here in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	8	21	fa6o	figs-idiom	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר אֶל לִבּ֗⁠וֹ	1	said in his heart,	“said/thought to himself,” Consider whether your language has this idiom or a similar idiom that would work well here, or whether it is better to translate this without an idiom. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	8	21	x9dl	translate-key-terms	לֹֽא אֹ֠סִף לְ⁠קַלֵּ֨ל אֶת הָֽ⁠אֲדָמָה֙	1	“Never again will I curse the ground	“I will never again curse/devastate the ground/earth”. Make sure that your translation of “curse” does not imply the use of magic. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms]])
GEN	8	21	rm8z		בַּ⁠עֲב֣וּר הָֽ⁠אָדָ֔ם	1	because of mankind,	“because of mankind{’s sins},” or “to punish mankind {for their sins},”

See how you translated “inclination” in a similar phrase in Gen 6:5. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

GEN	8	21	n6u9	figs-idiom	NO OrigLQuote AVAILABLE!!!	0	strike	“destroy/annihilate/kill”. Consider whether your language has this idiom or a similar idiom that fits well here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	8	21	zlf5		אֶת כָּל חַ֖י	1	every living {thing}	“every living {creature}” or “all living {things/creatures}”

GEN	8	22	b8rx	figs-parallelism	וְ⁠קֹ֨ר וָ⁠חֹ֜ם	1	and cold and heat,	“cold {weather/season} and hot {weather/season},” These terms form a parallelism with “summer and winter”. If possible, it is best to keep both parts of the parallelism in your translation, since each part has a different emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
GEN	8	22	gxe4		וְ⁠קַ֧יִץ וָ⁠חֹ֛רֶף	1	and summer and winter,	“summer and winter,” The seasons of summer and winter may be described differently depending on which part of the world your language area is located in. For example, some translations might use the terms “dry season” and “rainy/wet season”, depending on what best corresponds to summer and winter in that area.
GEN	24	1	liw0	figs-doublet	וְ⁠אַבְרָהָ֣ם זָקֵ֔ן בָּ֖א בַּ⁠יָּמִ֑ים	1	Now Abraham was old, advanced in days,	“Abraham had lived a long time and was {now} {very} old,” or “Abraham was very old now. He had lived many years,” or “Now Abraham had become very old,” Verse one gives the setting for the new episode and begins with a doublet that emphasizes how old Abraham was. Try to preserve this emphasis in a way that is natural in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
GEN	24	1	n1sq		וַֽ⁠יהוָ֛ה בֵּרַ֥ךְ אֶת אַבְרָהָ֖ם	1	and Yahweh had blessed Abraham	“and Yahweh had blessed him” or “and Yahweh had caused him to prosper”. See how you translated “bless” in Gen 12:2-3.
GEN	24	1	fwi8		בַּ⁠כֹּֽל	1	in everything.	“in everything {he had done}.” or “in every way.”
GEN	24	2	sfdw	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אַבְרָהָ֗ם אֶל	1	Then Abraham said to	“{One day} Abraham/he told”. Consider what is the best way to introduce the first event in this episode in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
GEN	24	2	ej0i		עַבְדּ⁠וֹ֙ זְקַ֣ן בֵּית֔⁠וֹ	1	his oldest servant of his house	“the oldest servant in his household” or “his senior/chief household servant”

GEN	24	2	tszi	translate-symaction	שִֽׂים נָ֥א יָדְ⁠ךָ֖ תַּ֥חַת יְרֵכִֽ⁠י	1	Please put your hand under my thigh,	“Please put your hand under my thigh/leg {to show that you will do what I ask}”. You can make the meaning of this custom explicit in your translation, or you can put that information in a footnote. What Abraham asks his servant to do here is part of the vow-making process in verse 3. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
GEN	24	3	ui17	figs-imperative	וְ⁠אַשְׁבִּ֣יעֲ⁠ךָ֔	1	and I will have you swear	“I want you to vow {to me}” or “and swear/vow {to me}” or “and make an unbreakable promise {to me}”. Decide the best way to translate this command in your language. Also, see how you translated “swear” in Gen 21:23, and see the note about that there. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
GEN	24	3	u0oa		בַּֽ⁠יהוָה֙ אֱלֹהֵ֣י הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֔יִם וֵֽ⁠אלֹהֵ֖י הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	by Yahweh, the God of the heavens and the God of the earth,	“with Yahweh as your witness, the God who rules/created the heavens and the earth,” See how you translated “the heavens and the earth” in Gen 1:1.
GEN	24	3	cjlz	figs-idiom	אֲשֶׁ֨ר לֹֽא תִקַּ֤ח אִשָּׁה֙ לִ⁠בְנִ֔⁠י מִ⁠בְּנוֹת֙	1	that you will not take a wife for my son from	“that you will not get/find/choose a wife/woman for my son {Isaac} {to marry} from {among}” or “that you will not arrange for my son {Isaac} to marry”. For some languages it is clearer and more natural to make “Isaac” explicit here in verse 3, rather than wait until the end of verse 4. Do what is best in your language. Also, see how you translated the idiom “took a wife for” in Gen 21:21. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	24	3	g7qm		מִ⁠בְּנוֹת֙ הַֽ⁠כְּנַעֲנִ֔י אֲשֶׁ֥ר אָנֹכִ֖י יוֹשֵׁ֥ב בְּ⁠קִרְבּֽ⁠וֹ	1	the daughters of the Canaanites whom I am living among,	“the Canaanite women whom we live among” or “{any of} the Canaanite women who live around us here”. Make sure your translation does not sound like Abraham was living by himself among the Canaanites; his family and servants also lived among them with him.
GEN	24	4	quii	figs-imperative	כִּ֧י תֵּלֵ֑ךְ	1	but you will go	“Rather/Instead you must go” or “Rather/Instead I want you to go” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])

GEN	24	4	b5iq		וְ⁠לָקַחְתָּ֥ אִשָּׁ֖ה לִ⁠בְנִ֥⁠י לְ⁠יִצְחָֽק	1	and take a wife for my son, for Isaac.	“and find/choose a wife/woman {from there} for my son Isaac {to marry}.” or “and get/choose a wife/woman {from among them} for him {to marry}.” or “and arrange for him to marry one of their daughters.” The way you refer to Isaac here will depend on how you refer to him in verse 3.
GEN	24	5	fqio	writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר אֵלָי⁠ו֙ הָ⁠עֶ֔בֶד	1	Then the servant said to him,	“Then the servant asked Abraham,” or “But {Abraham’s} servant asked him,” Consider the best way to translate this quote margin in your language so that it fits the context well. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	24	5	zdzo	figs-hypo	אוּלַי֙	1	Suppose	“Suppose {that}” or “What {should I do} if”. See how you translated this in Gen 18:24, 28, 29. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	24	6	piwz		הִשָּׁ֣מֶר לְ⁠ךָ֔ פֶּן תָּשִׁ֥יב אֶת בְּנִ֖⁠י	1	Be sure that you do not take my son back	“{No,} be/make sure that you never take my son back” or “{No,} you must definitely not/never take my son back”

GEN	24	7	zrue		יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֵ֣י הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֗יִם	1	Yahweh, the God of the heavens,	“{because} Yahweh, the God who rules/created the heavens,” Make sure it is clear in your translation that verse 7 gives the reason for verse 6. Also, see how you translated “the God of the heavens” in verse 3.
GEN	24	7	spu8		אֲשֶׁ֨ר לְקָחַ֜⁠נִי מִ⁠בֵּ֣ית אָבִ⁠י֮	1	who took me from the house of my father	“brought/led me {here} from my father’s household”

The phrase “this land” refers to the land of Canaan here, not the land where Abraham’s relatives lived. Make sure that is clear in your translation. Also, consider whether it is more natural here in your language to use a direct quote or an indirect quote. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
GEN	24	7	zirf		ה֗וּא יִשְׁלַ֤ח מַלְאָכ⁠וֹ֙ לְ⁠פָנֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1	he will send his angel before you,	“He will send one of his angels ahead of you {to guide/help you},” If you begin a new sentence here, make sure that the previous sentence is well-formed and complete in your language. Also, see how you translated “angel” in Gen 22:11,15.
GEN	24	7	ptk3		וְ⁠לָקַחְתָּ֥	1	and you will take	“so that you will {be able to} find/choose” or “so that you can find/get”.
GEN	24	7	uao2		אִשָּׁ֛ה לִ⁠בְנִ֖⁠י מִ⁠שָּֽׁם	1	a wife for my son from there.	“a wife/woman from my home country/land for my son {to marry}.” See how you translated “take/find a wife for” in verses 3-4.

GEN	24	8	pjpj		לֹ֨א תֹאבֶ֤ה	1	is not willing	“does not want” or “refuses”. See how you translated this in verse 5.
GEN	24	8	at23		לָ⁠לֶ֣כֶת אַחֲרֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1	to come with you,	“to come {back} {here} with you,” or “to follow you {back} {here},” See how you translated a similar phrase (“to come with me”) in verse 5.
GEN	24	8	ps9v		וְ⁠נִקִּ֕יתָ מִ⁠שְּׁבֻעָתִ֖⁠י	1	then you are clear from	“then you will be released/free from {keeping}” or “then you will not have to keep/fulfill”
GEN	24	8	ki3x		מִ⁠שְּׁבֻעָתִ֖⁠י זֹ֑את	1	this oath	“this oath/vow” or “this binding/unbreakable promise”. An oath is a serious, unbreakable promise or vow that is made before God to guarantee that it will be fulfilled. See how you translated the verb form of this word (“swear” or “vow”) in verse 3.
GEN	24	8	wrzm		מִ⁠שְּׁבֻעָתִ֖⁠י	1	of mine.	“that I am asking/requesting you to swear/make {today/now}.” or “that you are swearing/making to me {today/now}.”

See how you translated a similar clause in verse 2. Also, in that culture, people owned servants and had complete authority over them. Make sure your translation of “master” and “servant” does not imply that the servant was mistreated. Servants were treated well, could hold important positions and were often considered as members of the master’s family. See how you translated a related term “mistress/owner” in Gen 16:4, 8-9. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
GEN	24	9	cu0x		וַ⁠יִּשָּׁ֣בַֽע ל֔⁠וֹ	1	and swore to him	“and vowed to him” or “and made an oath/vow to him” or “and made an unbreakable promise to him”.  See how you translated “swore” in verse 7 and “swear” in verse 3.
GEN	24	9	m1u3	figs-explicit	עַל הַ⁠דָּבָ֖ר הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1	concerning this matter.	“that he would do what he/Abraham had requested/told him to do.”  or “that he would go get/find a wife/woman for Isaac.” Some languages need to make explicit what “this matter” refers to. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	24	10	clbm	grammar-connect-time-sequential	וַ⁠יִּקַּ֣ח הָ֠⁠עֶבֶד	1	Then the servant	“Then/Next he” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])

Make sure that your translation of “took” does not imply that the servant stole the camels or valuable things from Abraham. Rather, the “good things” that he loaded on the camels included things that he would give as gifts to Isaac’s relatives (verse 53). Also, see how you translated “camels” in Gen 12:16.
GEN	24	10	hnwf	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֵּ֔לֶךְ וְ⁠כָל ט֥וּב אֲדֹנָ֖י⁠ו בְּ⁠יָד֑⁠וֹ וַ⁠יָּ֗קָם וַ⁠יֵּ֛לֶךְ	1	and left, and all kinds of good things from his master were in his hand, and he got up and	“and left {with some other servants}, taking with him many of his master’s valuable things {to give as gifts}. Then he” or “and after he loaded them with all kinds of valuable things from his master {to use as gifts}, he left {with some other servants} and”. For some languages, it is best to make it explicit here in verse 10 that other servants went with Abraham’s chief servant, rather than have them appear suddenly in verse 32. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	24	10	nj39		וַ⁠יֵּ֛לֶךְ אֶל	1	went to	“made the {long} journey/trip to” or “traveled to”. This was about a 500 mile (800 kilometer) trip and would take camels about seventeen days to complete.
GEN	24	10	xmf8		אֲרַ֥ם נַֽהֲרַ֖יִם	1	Aram Naharaim,	“{the region of} Aram Naharaim,”
GEN	24	10	ljnb		אֶל עִ֥יר נָחֽוֹר	1	to the city of Nahor.	“to Nahor’s city.” or “to the city where Nahor lived.” Nahor lived in the city of Haran (Gen 11:31-32). That information could be put in a footnote. Make sure your translation of this phrase does not sound like Nahor owned the city.
GEN	24	11	u2n1		וַ⁠יַּבְרֵ֧ךְ הַ⁠גְּמַלִּ֛ים מִ⁠ח֥וּץ לָ⁠עִ֖יר	1	Then he made the camels kneel down outside the city	“{When they arrived there,} Abraham’s servant had the camels kneel/lie down {to rest} outside the city”
GEN	24	11	f6u3		אֶל בְּאֵ֣ר הַ⁠מָּ֑יִם	1	by the well of water	“near its well” or “by/near the {community/public} well {that was there}”. Each town or city had a well where people from the city came to get their water. See how you translated “well of water” in Gen 21:19. You might translate this slightly differently here because of the different context.
GEN	24	11	drfp		לְ⁠עֵ֣ת עֶ֔רֶב	1	at evening time,	“It was evening time,” Consider whether or not it is more natural to begin a new sentence here in your language.
GEN	24	11	vqil	figs-explicit	לְ⁠עֵ֖ת צֵ֥את הַ⁠שֹּׁאֲבֹֽת	1	at the time the women who draw water come out.	“the time when the {young} women {of the city} came out to draw/get water {from the well} {for their families/homes}.” or “when the {young} women {of the city} were starting to come out {to the well} to draw/get water {for their families/homes}.” In that time and culture, there was no running water in homes so people had to come out to the city well to get water for their families. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	24	12	fiil	writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּאמַ֓ר	1	Then he said,	Then Abraham’s servant said/prayed,” Consider what is the best way to begin this paragraph in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	24	12	skqc		יְהוָ֗ה	1	Yahweh,	“{Dear/Oh} Yahweh,” Consider what is the best way to begin this prayer in your language.

It may be clearer and more natural to change the order of the clauses in this sentence and say, “Please be kind/gracious to my master by helping me succeed today.” or “Please show your kindness to my master today by helping me {find a  wife/woman for his son to marry}.” Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	24	12	usgx		הַקְרֵה נָ֥א לְ⁠פָנַ֖⁠י הַ⁠יּ֑וֹם	1	please cause it to happen before me today	“please help me do what I have come here to do today” or “please help me succeed today”

GEN	24	13	xjo3	writing-politeness	הִנֵּ֛ה אָנֹכִ֥י נִצָּ֖ב עַל	1	Behold, I am standing by	“Look/See, {here} I am, standing beside/near” or “As you see/know, I am standing {here} beside/near”. Make sure in your translation that what Abraham’s servant says here to Yahweh sounds polite and respectful, not rude, demanding or complaining. Also, he is not telling God something that God did not already know. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness]])
GEN	24	13	oze9		עֵ֣ין הַ⁠מָּ֑יִם	1	this spring of water,	“this spring/well,” or “this spring-fed well”. The phrase “spring of water” (here and in verse 16) refers to the same well that is referred to in verses 11 and 20, which means that this was probably a spring-fed well. Some translation teams use only one term to refer to this spring or well throughout this chapter in order to prevent confusion. Decide what is best in your language.

Some languages have a single word for this; other languages prefer a phrase. Also, for some languages it is clearer and more natural to make one or both of the following two embedded direct quotes into indirect quotes. Do what is best in your language.

Do what is natural in your language.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Also see how you translated “my lord” in Gen 23:6, 11, 15. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-honorifics]])

Starting in verse 21 the Hebrew text takes Rebekah and Laban’s perspective and refers to Abraham’s servant as “the man”. This continues until verse 34, when the servant tells everyone that he is Abraham’s servant. For some languages this is confusing (because it sounds like two different people), so for those languages it is necessary to refer to him as “Abraham’s servant” or “the servant” throughout this chapter. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

Many translation teams keep the numbers and the names of weights that are used in the Bible text in their translation, and they may or may not put the modern equivalents in pounds or grams in a footnote. Other teams do the opposite. One beka was about 1/5 of an ounce (5.5 grams), and ten shekels (see below) was about 4 ounces (110 grams). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bweight]])
GEN	24	22	rmht		וּ⁠שְׁנֵ֤י צְמִידִים֙ זָהָ֖ב	1	and two gold bracelets	“He also gave her two gold bracelets”. Consider whether it is more natural in your language to start a new sentence here.
GEN	24	22	wkmm		עַל יָדֶ֔י⁠הָ	1	for her arms,	“for her wrists”. The Hebrew term is ambiguous here; it can refer to hands, arms or wrists. However in this context, the bracelets would have been put on the arms or the wrists.
GEN	24	22	q8y5	translate-bweight	עֲשָׂרָ֥ה מִשְׁקָלָֽ⁠ם	1	their weight was ten shekels.	“that weighed ten shekels {each}.” or “Each bracelet weighed ten shekels.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bweight]])

GEN	24	23	har4		בַּת מִ֣י אַ֔תְּ הַגִּ֥ידִי נָ֖א לִ֑⁠י	1	Whose daughter are you? Please tell me.	“Please tell me who your father is.” The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. The phrase “Please tell me” can go: (1) with the previous question; or (2) with the following question. Since Abraham’s servant’s goal is to find a wife for Isaac who is one of Abraham’s relatives, the first interpretation seems most likely.
GEN	24	23	xgry	writing-pronouns	הֲ⁠יֵ֧שׁ בֵּית אָבִ֛י⁠ךְ מָק֥וֹם	1	Is there a place at the house of your father	“{Also,} is there {enough} room/space at/in his house” or “{Also,} does your father have enough/any room in/at his house”. If you made “your father” explicit in the previous sentence, it may be more natural to refer to him with the pronoun “his” in this sentence. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	24	23	huhb	figs-exclusive	לָ֖⁠נוּ	1	for us	“for me and my men”. The pronoun “us” includes other servants who came with Abraham’s chief servant (as verse 32 shows). If your language has inclusive and exclusive forms of this pronoun, you should use the exclusive form here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
GEN	24	23	h5i5		לָ⁠לִֽין	1	to lodge?	“to spend the night {there}?” or “to stay {there} tonight?”

Also, in some cultures the father’s name is normally given first; in other cultures the mother’s name is normally first.
GEN	24	25	t1v3	writing-quotations	וַ⁠תֹּ֣אמֶר אֵלָ֔י⁠ו	1	Then she said to him,	“Then she added/continued,” Some languages leave this quote margin implied here, because the same person is still talking to the same person. Other languages can keep the quote margin (like the Hebrew text does), to emphasize what Rebekah says next. The quote margin may also indicate that Rebekah paused before she said what she says in verse 25. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	24	25	rbcw		גַּם תֶּ֥בֶן גַּם מִסְפּ֖וֹא רַ֣ב עִמָּ֑⁠נוּ	1	Plenty of both straw and fodder are with us.	“We have plenty of both straw and {other} feed {at our house} {for the/your camels to eat},” The term “fodder” refers to dry feed that is prepared for animals to eat; it can include chopped hay and grains such as oats and barley.
GEN	24	25	axja		גַּם מָק֖וֹם	1	There is also a place	“{and there is} also {enough} room {at/in his/our house} {for all of you}”

See how you translated “bowed” in Gen 18:2; 19:1. The word “prostrated” means he bowed low to the ground and touched his face or forehead to the ground with outstretched arms, in an act of worship. When combined with “bowed down” as in this verse, it is usually translated as “worshiped”. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
GEN	24	27	z3n9		וַ⁠יֹּ֗אמֶר	1	and said,	“saying,” or “He said,” The servant is worshiping God by bowing down and by what he says in verse 27.

See how you translated “kindness” in verses 12 and 14.  The phrase “not abandoned” is a way of emphasizing that Yahweh had always been kind and faithful to Abraham. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
GEN	24	27	z69b		אָנֹכִ֗י בַּ⁠דֶּ֨רֶךְ֙ נָחַ֣⁠נִי יְהוָ֔ה	1	As for me, Yahweh has led me on the road	“and he has guided me on the road/journey {here}” or “{Yes,} Yahweh/he guided me on the/my journey/trip {here}”. The last part of verse 27 is what  Abraham’s servant is praising God for; it is an example of how God has been kind and faithful to Abraham.
GEN	24	27	tk1t		בֵּ֖ית אֲחֵ֥י אֲדֹנִֽ⁠י	1	to the home of the relatives of my master!	“to the home of my master’s relatives/family!” or “to the home where my master’s relatives/family live!”

Verse 30 is a flashback of what had happened before Laban ran to the well (verse 29). Consider the best way to express this in your language. For some languages it may be necessary to combine verses 29-30 and put the sentences in the order that things actually happened. For example, “Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban. When he saw the nose ring and the bracelets that she was wearing, and heard her tell what the man had said to her, he hurried out to meet the man. He found/saw him standing with his camels beside the well.” If you do this, you would mark these combined verses as 29-30. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])

If you want to make it clear who “the man” refers to, you should still translate it generally, for example, “the man {I met at the well}” because when Rebekah said this, she did not yet know who he was. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

Do what is most natural in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
GEN	24	32	c9wy		וַ⁠יְפַתַּ֖ח הַ⁠גְּמַלִּ֑ים	1	Then he unloaded the camels	“{When they arrived there,} Laban unloaded the camels” or “There Laban took the loads off the camels”. The Hebrew text (“he”) is ambiguous here, but since Laban was the host it is most likely that he (or some of his servants) took care of the camels for his guests.

See how you translated “wash {the dust off} your feet” in Gen 19:2. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

GEN	24	38	ngqt		אִם לֹ֧א	1	but rather	“Rather/Instead”. Consider whether or not it is more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here. After you translate a section, it is a good habit to read through it at normal speed as you pay attention to where it is best to begin new sentences so that sentences and paragraphs flow well and it is easy for people to read.

Both terms refer to the same source of water. See the note about this at verse 13.

Consider again how you translated “young woman” in verses 14-16, 28, 43, 55 and 57, and see the note about this at verse 14. You may need to translate this differently, depending on the context.

Notice that Rebekah does not actually leave until verse 61. If this is not clear in your translation, you could include the implied information that they agreed or decided to send her with Abraham’s servant. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	24	59	xivl		וְ⁠אֶת מֵנִקְתָּ֑⁠הּ	1	and her nurse	“and her {personal} servant {who had helped raise her},” The term “nurse” refers here to a servant woman who probably nursed Rebekah as a baby, took care of her as she was growing up, and still served her now.

GEN	24	60	t3ay		אֲחֹתֵ֕⁠נוּ	1	“Our sister,	“{Dear} {little} sister,” This is a term of endearment that family members used to refer to Rebekah even though she was not the actual sister of all of them. This practice is common in many cultures. Do what is natural in your language.

What Isaac does in verse 63 happened sometime after he returned from Beer Lahai Roi, but the Hebrew text does not say exactly when. So introduce this new event in a general way that is not too specific.
