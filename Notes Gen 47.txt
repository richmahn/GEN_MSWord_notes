Gen 47:1 Then Joseph went and reported to Pharaoh and said, “My father and my brothers and their flock{s} and their herd{s} and all that {belongs} to them have come from the land of Canaan, and behold, they {are} in the land of Goshen.” 

Then Joseph went and reported to Pharaoh and said, 
“Then/So Joseph went to {King} Pharaoh and informed/told {him},” See how you translated “report to Pharaoh” in Gen 46:31.

“My father and my brothers 
“My father, my brothers {and their families},” It is implied that the brothers brought their families with them. Consider whether or not to make that explicit in your translation. (See: figs-explicit)

and their flock{s} and their herd{s} 
“and/with their flock{s} {of sheep and goats} and their herd{s} {of cattle}” or “{along} with their sheep, {goats,} cattle,”

and all that {belongs} to them
“and everything {else} that they own,“ or “and all {the rest of} their belongings/possessions,”

have come from the land of Canaan, 
“have come {here} from the land/region of Canaan.” For some languages it may be clearer or more natural to put this clause and the rest of this verse earlier in this sentence. For example: “My father and my brothers {and their families} have come {to Egypt} from the region of Canaan and {are} now in Goshen Province. {They brought with them} their sheep...” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

and behold, they {are} 
“They {are staying} now” or “and they have {already} arrived”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

in the land of Goshen.”
“in the region/territory of Goshen.” or “in Goshen Province/County.”

 
Gen 47:2 Then he took five men from among his brothers, and he presented them before Pharaoh. 

Then he took five men from among his brothers, and he presented them before Pharaoh.
“Then he/Joseph took/brought five of his brothers before/to Pharaoh and presented/introduced them {to him}.” or “Joseph had brought five of his brothers {with him} {from Goshen}, so he took/brought them before Pharaoh and presented/introduced them {to him}.” Joseph probably brought his father and brothers with him from Goshen (46:31) to Pharaoh’s palace. It is not clear whether or not they were in the room yet when Joseph spoke to Pharaoh about them (47:1).


Gen 47:3 Then Pharaoh said to his brothers, “What {is} your work?” And they said to Pharaoh, “Your servants {are} herders of sheep, both we and our fathers.” 

Then Pharaoh said to his brothers, 
“Then Pharaoh asked Joseph’s brothers,” or “Then Pharaoh asked them,” Make sure that your translation of “his brothers” refers to Joseph’s brothers, not Pharaoh’s. (See: writing-pronouns)

“What {is} your work?” 
“What {is} your occupation?” or “What {kind of} work do you do?” or “What do you do for a living?”

And they said to Pharaoh, 
“They answered Pharaoh/him,” or “{One of} them said/replied,”

“Your servants 
“{We} your {humble} servants” or “Your Majesty/Highness, we” or “Sir, we”. See how you translated “your servants” in Gen 46:34. (See: figs-123person)

{are} herders of sheep,
“{are} shepherds/herdsmen,” or “raise sheep {for a living},”

both we and our fathers.” 
“just like/as our forefathers/ancestors were/did.” or “{which is} the same {kind of} work/occupation that our forefathers/ancestors did/had.”


Gen 47:4 Then they said to Pharaoh, “We have come to sojourn in the land, because there is not pasture for the flock{s} that {belong} to your servants, because the famine {is} heavy in the land of Canaan. So now, please let your servants settle in the land of Goshen.”

Then they said to Pharaoh, 
“They {also} said to him,” or “Then they added,” For some languages it is more natural here to omit this quote margin, because the same people (Joseph’s brothers) are still talking to the same person (Pharaoh). However, the words emphasize what Joseph’s five brothers say next and may indicate that there was a pause between what they said in verse 3 and verse 4. Do what is best in your language. (See: writing-quotations)

“We have come to sojourn 
“We have come {here} to live/stay for a while” or “We came {here} to live/stay temporarily”

in the land,
“in this country” or “in {your} land/country”

because there is not pasture for the flock{s} that {belong} to your servants, 
“because there was not enough pasture/grass for our flock{s} {of sheep and goats}” or “Our flocks, sir, did not have enough grass to eat”. Consider whether or not it is better to begin a new sentence here in your language. 

because the famine {is} heavy in the land of Canaan. 
“in the region of Canaan {where we are/come from}, because the famine {is} very/so severe/terrible {there}.” For some languages it may be clearer or more natural to put this clause earlier in this sentence. For example: “The famine is so severe/terrible in the region of Canaan {where we are/come from} that there is not enough grass {in the fields} for our flocks.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

So now, please let your servants settle 
“So now/then, please let {us} your {humble} servants settle/live” or “So then, sir, please let us settle/live”. See how you translated “your servants” in verse 3 to show respect. (See: figs-123person)

in the land of Goshen.”
“in the region/territory of Goshen.” or ‘in Goshen Province.”

Gen 47:5 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, saying, “Your father and your brothers have come to you. 

Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, saying, 
“Then Pharaoh {turned} to Joseph and said,” or “{When he heard that,} Pharaoh said to Joseph,”

“Your father and your brothers have come to you.
“{Now that} your father and brothers have come {to live} near you,” Make sure your translation of this clause does not sound like Pharaoh was telling Joseph something he did not already know. Rather, he is stating shared knowledge as the basis for what he says next.
 

Gen 47:6 The land of Egypt {is} before you. Settle your father and your brothers in the best land; let them settle in the land of Goshen. And if you know that there are men of ability among them, then appoint them overseers of livestock over {those} that {belong} to me.”

The land of Egypt {is} before you. 
“the {entire} land of Egypt {is} available to you {to choose from}.” or “you may choose any part of the land of Egypt {for them to live in}.” Consider whether it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here or to continue the sentence from verse 5.

Settle your father and your brothers 
“{So} have your father and your brothers settle” or “{In fact,} they may settle/live” (See: writing-pronouns)

in the best land; let them settle in the land of Goshen.
“in the best/finest land {in the country}, in Goshen Province.” or “in the region/territory of Goshen, {which is} the best/finest land {in the country}.”

And if you know that there are men of ability among them,
“And if you know that some of them are especially/very talented/skilled {at/in raising livestock},”

then appoint them overseers of livestock over {those} that {belong} to me.”
“then make them herdsmen over my livestock {also}.” or “then put them in charge of raising my livestock {also}.”

Gen 47:7 Then Joseph brought Jacob his father and presented him before Pharaoh, and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.

Then Joseph brought Jacob his father 
“Then Joseph brought/took his father Jacob” 

and presented him before Pharaoh,
“and presented/introduced him to Pharaoh,” or “before/to Pharaoh and presented/introduced him {to him},” or “to Pharaoh and introduced them to each other,” See how you translated “presented” in verse 2.

and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. 
“and Jacob {greeted and} blessed Pharaoh.” or “and Jacob {asked God to} bless/prosper Pharaoh.” or “and Jacob greeted Pharaoh with a blessing.” In Hebrew, there is a common greeting which means “peace be to you,” so it is possible that Jacob used this blessing of peace here to greet Pharaoh.


Gen 47:8 Then Pharaoh said to Jacob, “How many {are} the days of the years of your life?” 

Then Pharaoh said to Jacob, 
“Then Pharaoh asked Jacob,”

“How many {are} the days of the years of your life?”
“{Sir,} how old are you now?” Make sure your translation of Pharaoh’s question about Jacob’s age sounds polite. Also, for some languages, a title of respect (such as “Sir”) is necessary whenever someone addresses a distinguished old man such as Jacob. (See: figs-politeness)


Gen 47:9 And Jacob said to Pharaoh, “The days of the years of my sojournings {are} 130 years. The days of the years of my life have been few and difficult, and they have not reached the days of the years of my fathers’ lives in the days of their sojournings.” 

And Jacob said to Pharaoh, 
“Jacob answered him,” or “Jacob replied,” (See: writing-quotations)

“The days of the years of my sojournings {are} 130 years. 
“I have been living {in this world} for 130 years.” or “The length of my life {so far} has been 130 years.” Consider again how you translated “sojournings”, “sojourn” and “sojourner” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 12:10; 15:13; 17:8; 19:9; 20:1; 21:23, 34; 23:4; 26:3; 28:4; 32:4; 35:27; 37:1; 47:4, 9. It may be necessary to translate these terms in different ways, depending on the context. 

The days of the years of my life have been few and difficult,
“I have not lived very long, and I have faced/had many difficulties/hardships.” or “My life has been short, with many difficulties/hardships.”

and they have not reached the days of the years of my fathers’ lives 
“In fact, I have lived less years than my forefathers/ancestors did” or “In fact, I have not lived {nearly} as long as my forefathers/ancestors did”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

“during the days/years/time that they lived {on earth}.” or “during their years/time {on earth}.”


Gen 47:10 Then Jacob blessed Pharaoh and left from the presence of Pharaoh.

Then Jacob blessed Pharaoh 
“Then Jacob {again} {asked God to} bless Pharaoh” or “Then Jacob {said goodbye} to Pharaoh with a blessing”. It was customary in Hebrew to use the blessing “peace be to you” both when greeting and when leaving someone. See how you translated “blessed” in verse 7.

and left from the presence of Pharaoh.
“and left his presence.” or “and left him.” or “and left Pharaoh’s {throne} room.”

Gen 47:11 Then Joseph settled his father and his brothers, and he gave them property in the land of Egypt, in the best land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded. 

Then 
“So” or “After that,”

Joseph settled his father and his brothers, and he gave them property in the land of Egypt, in the best land, in the land of Rameses,
“Joseph gave his father and his brothers the best/choicest property/land in the country of Egypt, and they {and their families} settled there. {The property was} in Rameses Province/Count, {that is, Goshen Province/County},” or “Joseph helped his father and brothers settle in the country of Egypt. He gave them the choicest property {in Egypt}, which was in {Goshen Province, also known as} Rameses Province.” It is implied that Rameses (verse 11) was another name for Goshen (verses 1, 4, 6). If necessary, you could make that information explicit in your translation or put it in a footnote. Later in Egypt’s history, some of the Pharaohs were named Rameses and a city was named after one of them (Exodus 1:11). (See: figs-explicit)

as Pharaoh had commanded.
“just as Pharaoh had commanded/told him {to do}.” or “{He/Joseph did} {exactly} as Pharaoh had commanded/told him {to do}.” It may be more natural to put this clause first in this verse and say, “After that, Joseph did what Pharaoh had commanded/told him {to do}: He helped his father and brothers settle in the country of Egypt. He gave them property in Rameses Province/County, {that is, Goshen Province/County,} {which was} the choicest land {in Egypt}.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure) 


Gen 47:12 And Joseph provided his father and his brothers and all the household of his father {with} bread, according to the mouth{s} of the little ones.

And Joseph provided his father and his brothers and all the household of his father {with}
“Joseph {also} provided/supported his father and brothers and all {the rest of} his father’s household/family {with}” 

bread, according to the mouth{s} of the little ones.
“food, based on how many children/people were in each family.” or “as much food as {each family} needed to feed {all} the children/people in their family.“ The children are mentioned to emphasize that all the members of the families were well-provided for, including the youngest ones. Make sure it is clear in your translation that Joseph was providing food for everyone in each family, not just the children. (See: figs-synecdoche)


47:13-26 How Joseph Ruled Egypt During The Rest Of The Famine

Gen 47:13 Now there was no bread in all the earth, because the famine {was} very heavy, and the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan were languishing because of the famine.

Now 
“Now {meanwhile,}” or “{Meanwhile,}” or “{After a while,}” Consider the best way in your language to begin this new section that returns to the famine and how it was progressing.

there was no bread 
“there was no {more} food” or “there was {almost} no food” or “there was very little food {available}”. This clause is probably an exaggeration to emphasize that there was so little food that the people were starving. Consider the best way to communicate that in your language. (See: figs-hyperbole)

in all the earth,
This phrase is ambiguous in the Hebrew text. It could mean (1) “in all the earth,” or “in the entire {known} world,” or “anywhere,” which might be an exaggeration (like the previous phrase); (2) “in all the land,” or “in the/that entire area/region {of the earth/world},” which includes Egypt and Canaan (mentioned later in the verse) and other nearby regions and countries. See how you translated “all the earth” in Gen 41:57.

because the famine {was} very heavy, 
“because the famine {was} very/so severe/oppressive/terrible.” For some languages it may be clearer or more natural to put this clause first in this sentence and say, for example: “Now {after a while,} the famine was/became so severe/terrible in the entire world that there was very little food {available} {anywhere}.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

and the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan 
“As a result, {the people of/in} the country of Egypt and the region of Canaan” or “In fact, {the people living in} the lands of Egypt and Canaan”. Make sure your translation of this phrase refers to the people who live in Egypt and Canaan, not just the lands. (See: figs-metonymy)

were languishing 
“were fainting/weak” or “were suffering badly/terribly” or “were wasting away”. The verb “languishing” refers in general to the suffering that the famine was causing, including things such as weakness, fainting and other distress. Some languages have an idiom (like “were wasting away”) that fits well here. Do what is best in your language. 

because of the famine.
“because of the severe lack of food.” or “because they did not have enough to eat.” or “from hunger.”


Gen 47:14 And Joseph collected all the silver that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan for the grain which they were buying, and Joseph brought the silver to the house of Pharaoh. 

And Joseph collected all the silver that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan for the grain which they were buying,
“So the people spent their money buying grain from Joseph until he had collected/received all their money.” or “So they bought grain from Joseph until there was no more silver/money left in the country of Egypt or the land/region of Canaan.” 

and Joseph brought the silver to the house of Pharaoh. 
“Then Joseph/He {had his servants} take the silver/money to Pharaoh’s palace.” or “Joseph/He stored that silver/money in Pharaoh’s palace.” Joseph probably had servants do this for him. See what you did for a similar case in Gen 41:48. (See: figs-metonymy)


Gen 47:15 So the silver was consumed from the land of Egypt and from the land of Canaan, and all Egypt came to Joseph, saying, “Give us bread! And why should we die before you? For the silver is gone!” 

So the silver was consumed from the land of Egypt and from the land of Canaan, and
“So {when} {all} the silver/money in the land/country of Egypt and the land/region of Canaan had been used up,” or “When/After {the people in} Egypt and Canaan had spent all their silver/money,” Consider whether it is better in your language to use a passive or active clause here. (See: figs-activepassive)

all Egypt
“all {the people} in Egypt” or “the Egyptians all” or “{people from} all over Egypt”. The word “all” is an exaggeration (hyperbole) which emphasizes that a large number of Egyptians went to Joseph. Consider whether or not it is best to use hyperbole here in your language. (See: figs-hyperbole)

came to Joseph, 
“went to Joseph”. Consider whether “came” or “went” is more natural here in your language. (See: figs-go)

saying,
“and pleaded {with him},” or “and begged {him},” (See: writing-quotations)

“Give us bread! 
“{Sir,} {please} give us food”. Make sure your translation of the people’s request sounds polite, not rude or disrespectful. Also see how you translated “bread” in verses 12-13. (See: figs-synecdoche)

And why should we die before you? 
“so that we do not die {right here} in front of you!” or “and do not watch/let us starve to death!” or “so that we do not starve to death!“ The people use a rhetorical question here to emphasize how desperate they feel. Consider the best way to communicate that in your language. (See: figs-rquestion)

For the silver is gone!”
“There is no more money {to buy food/grain}!” or “We have no more money {to buy food/grain}!” It may be more natural to put this clause first in this quote and say, “{Sir,} we have no more money {to buy grain/food}! Please give us food so that we do not starve to death!“ Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 47:16 And Joseph said, “Bring your livestock and I will give {grain} to you {in exchange} for your livestock, since the silver is gone.” 

And Joseph said, 
“Joseph said/responded {to them},” or “Joseph replied,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Bring your livestock 
“Bring/Give {me} your livestock/animals”. The word “livestock” is general here and includes all the different kinds of animals that are specified in verse 17.

and I will give {grain} to you {in exchange} for your livestock, 
“and I will give/sell you {grain/food} if/when you give me your livestock/animals {to pay for it},” or ”and in exchange for them I will give you {grain/food},”

since the silver is gone.”
“since {all} your money is gone.” or “since you have spent {all} your silver/money.” For some languages it may be more natural to put this clause first in this quote and say, “Since your silver/money is gone, bring/give {me} your livestock to pay for the grain/food that I will give you.” Do what is best in your language.

Gen 47:17 So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave bread to them {in exchange} for the horses and for the herd{s} of sheep and for the herd{s} of cattle and for the donkeys. So he provided them with bread in that year {in exchange} for all their livestock.

So they brought their livestock to Joseph,
“So the people brought/took their livestock/animals to Joseph.”

and Joseph gave bread to them {in exchange} for the horses, and for the herd{s} of sheep, and for the herd{s} of cattle and for the donkeys.

Gen 47:18 And {when} that year had ended, then they came to him in the second year and said to him, “We cannot hide {it} from my lord that since the silver is consumed and the herd{s} of livestock {belong} to my lord, there is nothing left before my lord except our bodies and our lands.

“and told him,” or “and pleaded with him,” (See: writing-quotations)

“We cannot hide {it} from my lord that since
“Our lord/master, we cannot hide from you {the fact} that” or “Sir, as you know,”
For some languages, it may be more natural to put the address “my/our lord” or “sir” first in this quote. Also notice that this address is used three times in this verse to show extra respect to Joseph. Consider the best way to do that in your language. (See: figs-honorifics)

the silver is consumed and the herd{s} of livestock
“{our} silver/money is gone and our livestock/animals” or “not only is {our} silver/money {all} gone, but {all} {our} livestock/animals {also}”. Consider again how you translated “silver” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 13:2; 20:16 (and note) ; 23:15,16; 24:35, 53; 31:15; 37:28; 42:25, 27-28, 35; 43:12, 15, 18, 21-23; 44:1, 2, 8 ; 45:22; 47:14, 15, 16, 18. It may be necessary to translate this word in different ways, depending on the context.

{belong} to my lord,
“{belong} to {you,} our lord/master.” or “are yours, sir.” or “{belong} to you.” In this verse, the people use the third person (“my/our lord”) to address Joseph in a respectful manner. Consider the best way to do that in your language. (See: figs-123person)

there is nothing left before my lord except our bodies and our lands. 
“We have nothing left to pay/give you, sir, {for grain/food}, except ourselves and our land/fields.” or “The only way we can pay you {for grain/food} is to give you our land/farmland and work for you, sir.” Consider the best way to translate the Hebrew word for “land” here (and In verses 19-26), which refers to cultivated land (such as farmland or fields), not to the planet earth or to a country. It is different from the word for “land” in the rest of this chapter (in verses 1, 4, 6, 11, 13-15, 27-28).
 

Gen 47:19 Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land {in exchange} for the bread, and we and our land will be slaves to Pharaoh. Give {us} seed so that we will live and not die, and the land will not be desolate!”

Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? 
“What good would it do for us to die and our farmland/fields {to become ruined/empty}?” or “Please do not {just} watch us die or let our land/fields {become wasteland/desolate/empty}.” For many languages, the verb “die” does not fit with both people and land, so a different verb must be used for each one. The end of verse 19 specifies how the land would “die”. See how you translated a similar rhetorical question in verse 15. (See: figs-rquestion)

Buy us and our land {in exchange} for the bread, 
“{Instead,} {please} take us and our farmland/fields {in exchange} for food.” or “{Instead} {please} give us food and we will give you our farmland/fields and ourselves {to pay} for it.” Consider again how you translated the synecdoche “bread” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 3:19 (and note); 14:18; 21:14; 28:20; 37:25; 38:6; 41:54-55; 43:31; 47:12, 15, 17, 19. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context. (See: figs-synecdoche)

and we and our land will be slaves to Pharaoh. 
“Then we will be {King} Pharaoh’s slaves/servants, and our land/fields {will also be his}.” or “Then our land/fields will belong to {King} Pharaoh and we will work for him as his slaves/servants.” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

Give {us} seed 
“{Please} give {us} seeds {to sow/plant}” (See: figs-explicit)

so that we will live 
“so that we will/can survive” or “so that we will/can stay alive”

and not die,
“and not die {from hunger},” or “and not {starve} to death,” See how you translated “so that we will live and not die” in Gen 42:2.

and the land will not be desolate!”
“and {so that} the land will not become a desert!” or “and {so that} the land will produce/grow plants/crops {again}!” For some languages it may be clearer and more natural to put this clause earlier in this sentence and say, “{Please} {just} give {us} seeds {to plant} so that the land will produce/grow {food} crops {again} and then we will survive and not die {from hunger}!” Do what is best in your language.

Gen 47:20 Then Joseph bought all the {farm}land of Egypt for Pharaoh, because every Egyptian sold his field, because the famine was heavy for them. So the land became Pharaoh’s. 

Then Joseph 
“So Joseph {agreed and}” or “Joseph {did what they asked and}”. For some languages it may be necessary to make explicit that Joseph agreed to do what the people suggested. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-explicit)

“All the Egyptians sold/gave their fields {to him} {in exchange for grain/food},” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

because the famine 
“because the food shortage/scarcity”. Consider again how you translated “famine” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 12:10; 26:1; 41:27, 30-31, 36, 50, 54-57; 42:5; 43:1; 45:6, 11; 47:4, 13, 20. It may be necessary to translate it differently, depending on the context.

was heavy for them.
“was {so/very} severe/oppressive.” or “was so severe/terrible that they did not have enough to eat.” See how you translated “heavy” in verses 4 and 13. For some languages, it may be clearer or more natural to change the order of clauses in this verse and say, “The famine was {very} severe for all the Egyptian people, so Joseph {agreed with their request/suggestion and} let them sell their fields {to him} {in exchange for grain/food}. In that way, Joseph/he bought/acquired all the land/farmland in {the country of} Egypt for {King} Pharaoh, so that {all} the land became Pharaoh’s {property}.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

So
“In that way,” or “That is how”

the land became Pharaoh’s.
“{all} the farmland became Pharaoh’s {property}.” or “{all} the farmland {eventually} belonged to {King} Pharaoh.” 


Gen 47:21 And {as for} the people, he moved them to the cities from {one} end of the border of Egypt to its {other} end. 

And {as for} the people, he moved them to the cities 
“Joseph {also} moved {all} the people {from their farmlands} to the {nearby} cities”. The Masoretic Hebrew text has “moved them to the cities” here, which Joseph may have done in order to make the grain more readily accessible to them. The Samaritan Pentateuch (a different Hebrew version) and the Septuagint (Greek translation of the Hebrew text) have “made the people slaves” instead, which may refer to the fact that all the people would now be working for Pharaoh since all the fields belonged to him. The textual variant that is not used in your translation could be put in a footnote. (See: translate-textvariants)

“in every part of {the country of} Egypt.” or “throughout {the country of} Egypt.”


Gen 47:22 Only the land of the priests he did not buy, because {there was} an allotment for the priests from Pharaoh, and they ate {from} their allotment that Pharaoh gave to them. For that {reason} they did not sell their land.

Only the land of the priests he did not buy, 
“The only land/farmland that he/Joseph did not buy was the priests’ {land},” or “The priests’ land/farmland was the only land he/Joseph did not buy,”

because {there was} an allotment for the priests from Pharaoh,
“because they regularly received a certain amount {of food} from Pharaoh,” or “because Pharaoh gave them a regular {food} allotment/allowance,”

and they ate {from} their allotment that Pharaoh gave to them. 
”and they had enough to eat from what he gave to them.” or “so that they had plenty to eat.”

For that {reason} they did not sell their land.
“That is why they did not {need to} sell their land/farmland {to buy food}.”
 

Gen 47:23 Then Joseph said to the people, “Behold, today I have bought you and your land for Pharaoh. Here {is} seed for you so that you can sow the ground. 

Then Joseph said to the people, 
“Then/Next Joseph announced/declared to the {Egyptian} people,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Behold, 
“Look/Listen, 

today I have bought you and your land for Pharaoh. 
“now that I have bought/acquired you and your land/farmland/fields for {King} Pharaoh,” or “now that you and your land/farmland/fields belong to {King} Pharaoh,” 

Here {is} seed for you 
“here {are} {some} seeds for you” or “I am giving you {some} seeds”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

so that you can sow the land.
“so that you can plant {them in} the fields.” or “to plant {in} the fields.” See how you translated “sowed” in Gen 26:12.


Gen 47:24 And it will happen in the harvests that you must give a fifth to Pharaoh, and the four parts will be for you as seed of the field and as your food and for those in your houses, and for your little ones to eat.”

And it will happen in the harvests that 
“Then whenever you harvest/gather {the crops},” or “Then every harvest season/time,”

you must give a fifth to Pharaoh, 
“you are required to give one-fifth {of the harvest/crops} to {King} Pharaoh,” or “you must give {King} Pharaoh one-fifth {of the crops you harvest/gather}.”

and the four parts 
“but the {remaining/other} four-fifths” or “The {remaining/other} four-fifths {of your harvest}” or “The rest {of what you harvest/gather}”. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin a new sentence here.

will be for you
“will be yours” or “you may keep for yourselves,”

as seed of the field 
“as seed/seeds to plant the fields” or “to plant seeds {in} the fields” 

and as your food and for those in your houses, 
“and as food for you and your households/families,” or “and for you and your households/families to eat,”

and for your little ones to eat.” 
“including your children.”


Gen 47:25 And they said, “You have kept us alive! Let us find favor in the eyes of my lord, and we will be slaves for Pharaoh.” 

And they said, 
“Then they responded,” or “The people said/replied {to him},” (See: writing-quotations)

“You have kept us alive! 
“You have saved our lives!” or “You have made it so we can live!”

Let us find favor in the eyes of my lord, 
“May we {continue to} find favor in your eyes/sight, master/sir,” or “Please {continue to} be kind to us, master/sir,”

and we will be slaves for Pharaoh.” 
“and we will {agree to} be/become {King} Pharaoh’s slaves/servants.” or “and we will serve {King} Pharaoh as his slaves/servants.”
 

Gen 47:26 And Joseph established it as a law to this day concerning the {farm}land of Egypt, {that} the fifth {belongs} to Pharaoh. Only the land of the priests by itself did not become Pharaoh’s. 

And Joseph established it as a law 
“So Joseph established/made a law”

to this day 
“{that is} still {in effect/force} today/now”. This phrase refers to the time that Moses was writing the book of Genesis. You could put that information in a footnote. For some languages it may be clearer or more natural to put this phrase at the end of the sentence and say, “{That law} is still {in effect/force} today/now.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

concerning the {farm}land of Egypt, {that} the fifth {belongs} to Pharaoh. 
“concerning/about the farmland/fields in {the country of} Egypt: one-fifth {of the harvest/crops} {belongs} to Pharaoh.” or “{that required} {people to give} to Pharaoh one-fifth {of all the crops they harvested} from the farmland/fields in Egypt.” See how you translated “a fifth” in verse 24. 

Only the land of the priests by itself did not become Pharaoh’s.
“The priests’ land was the only land {in Egypt} that did not belong to Pharaoh.” or “The only land that Pharaoh did not own was the land that belonged to the priests.” See how you translated “only the land of the priests” in verse 22. Also, consider again how you translated “land/farmland” in verses 18-26.


47:27-31 Jacob’s Last Wishes

 Gen 47:27 And Israel settled in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen, and they acquired {possessions} in it. And they were fruitful and multiplied greatly.

And 
“So/Now” or “Meanwhile”. It was already mentioned in verse 11 that Israel (Jacob) had settled in the country of Egypt. Your translation of verse 27 should not imply that he settled there again. (See: grammar-connect-time-background)

Israel 
“{Jacob, whose other name was} Israel,” or “Israel {that is, Jacob,}” The name “Israel” and the name “Jacob” refer to the same person. To make that clear, you could make “Jacob” explicit here in your translation or in a footnote. (See: figs-explicit)

settled 
“had settled {with his family}” or “was living/dwelling {with his family}”

in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen,
“in the region/territory of Goshen in the land/country of Egypt,” or “in Goshen Province/County in the country of Egypt,” See how you translated “in the land of Goshen” in Gen 45:10.

and they acquired {possessions} 
“and they acquired/gained {many possessions}” or “and owned/possessed {much property/land}”. This phrase is general here and refers to acquiring land and other possessions. (See: figs-explicit)

in it.
“in that {region/territory}.” or “there.”

And they were fruitful 
“They were fruitful/prolific” or “They had many children”. See how you translated a similar phrase (“be fruitful and multiply”) in Gen 35:11. (See: figs-idiom)

and multiplied greatly. 
“and their numbers increased greatly.” or “and became very numerous/many.”
 

Gen 47:28 And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years, and the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were 147 years, 

And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years, and
“{When/After} Jacob had lived in the country of Egypt {for} seventeen years,”

the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were 147 years,
“he reached the age of 147 years.” or “he was 147 years old.”


Gen 47:29 and the days of Israel drew near {for him} to die. So he called for his son, for Joseph, and said to him, “If, please, I have found favor in your eyes, please put your hand under my thigh, and deal with me {in} kindness and faithfulness. Please do not bury me in Egypt. 

and the days of Israel drew near {for him} to die. So
“{When} it was almost time for Israel/him to die,” or “Israel/He {knew that} it was almost time for him to die, so” 

he called for his son, for Joseph,
“he summoned his son Joseph” or “he asked for his son Joseph {to come to him}”

and said to him, 
“and urged him,” (See: writing-quotations)

“If, please, I have found favor in your eyes, 
“Please show your favor/kindness toward me {and}“ or “Please do this favor for me:” or “Please, if you {truly} love me,” (See: figs-idiom)

please put your hand under my thigh, 
“put your hand under my thigh/leg {to show you will do what I ask},” See how you translated this clause in Gen 24:2, and see the note about this custom there. (See: translate-symaction)

and deal with me {in} kindness and faithfulness. 
“and {promise me that} {after I die,} you will be kind and faithful to me.” Consider again how you translated “kindness” in Gen 19:19; 20:13; 21:23; 24:12, 14, 27, 49; 32:10; 39:21; 40:14; 47:29, and how you translated “faithfulness” in Gen 24:27, 48, 49; 32:10; 42:16; 47:29.

Please do not bury me 
“Please {promise that you will} not bury my body/bones”. Make sure your translation of “bury me” does not sound like Israel would still be alive when he was buried. 

in Egypt.
“{here} in {the land/country of} Egypt.”


Gen 47:30 And {when} I lie down with my fathers, then carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their tomb.” And he said, “I will do according to your word.” 

And {when} I lie down with my fathers, 
“{When/After} I die and rest/sleep with my ancestors,” or “Rather, after I die and join my ancestors {who have died/gone before me},” The phrase “lie down with my fathers” is a idiom that refers to Jacob's death. See how you translated an idiom with a similar meaning in Gen 15:15. (See: figs-euphemism)

then carry me out of Egypt 
“carry/take my body out of Egypt {to the region of Canaan}”. See how you translated “me” in verse 29.

and bury me in their tomb.”
“and bury me/it in the same burial place where their bodies are.” Jacob is referring here to the cave near the city of Hebron that Abraham had bought as a family burial place, to bury Sarah there. Abraham, Isaac and Rebekah were also buried there (Gen 23:19-20; 25:9-10; 49:31). You could put some of that information in a footnote. Also see how you translated “grave” in Gen 35:20 and a different word with a similar meaning (“burial place”) in Gen 23:4, 6, 9, 20. 

And he 
“Then Joseph” or “Joseph”. Make sure it is clear in your translation that Joseph is the one speaking here. It may be helpful to read this paragraph aloud to make sure it is clear who is talking at each point in the conversation. (See: writing-pronouns)

said,
“replied {to him},” or “promised {him},” (See: writing-quotations)

“I will do according to your word.”
"I will do as/what you requested {of me}.” or “I will do exactly what you asked {me to do}.”


Gen 47:31 Then he said, “Swear to me.” And he swore to him. Then Israel bowed at the head of the bed.

Then he 
“But he” or “But his/Joseph’s father”. Consider what is the best way to refer to Joseph’s father Israel here in your language. (See: writing-pronouns)

said, 
“urged {him},” or “insisted,” (See: writing-quotations)

Swear to me.”
“Swear/Vow to me {by/before God/Yahweh} {that you will do it/that}.” or “{With God/Yahweh as your witness,} make an oath/vow to me {that you will do it/that}.” See how you translated “swear to me” in Gen 21:23.

And he swore to him. 
“So Joseph swore/vowed {that he would do it/that}.” or “So Joseph promised his father with an oath/vow {to do what he had requested}.” Make sure it is clear in your translation that Joseph is the one speaking here. (See: writing-pronouns)

Then Israel bowed
“Then Israel bowed {down} {to worship/thank God}” or “Then {his father} Israel bowed {his head} {and worshiped/thanked God}”. If it is not clear in your culture why Israel bowed, you could make that explicit. (See: translate-symaction)

at the head of the bed.
“{as he sat} at the head/top of {his} bed.” or “{as he was sitting/lying} on {his} bed.” The Hebrew text has “at the head of the bed” here, while the Septuagint (Greek translation of the Old Testament) has “on the top of his staff” instead, which is quoted in Hebrews 11:21. You could include some of that information in a footnote. The difference between versions may be due to the fact that the Hebrew words for “bed” and “staff” are very similar in spelling. Or it could be that Jacob did both; for example, he may have been sitting at the head of his bed and leaning on his staff when he bowed his head and worshiped God.
