Gen 30:1 Now Rachel saw that she was not bearing {children} for Jacob, so Rachel envied her sister, and she said to Jacob, “Give me children, and if not, I will die!”

Now Rachel saw that she was not bearing {children} for Jacob, so 
“Now/Meanwhile when Rachel saw/realized that she was not able to bear/have {any} {children} for Jacob,”

Rachel envied her sister, 
“she was envious/jealous of her sister {Leah},”

and she said to Jacob, 
“and she pleaded with Jacob,” or “and she demanded of Jacob,” Use a quote margin here in your language that fits the context well. (See: writing-quotations)

“Give me children, and if not,
“Help me have children, or else” or “Help me get pregnant! Otherwise”

I will die!”
“I want to die!” or “I have no reason to live!” Rachel is using hyperbole (exaggeration) to show how desperate and deeply ashamed she feels about not having children. You could include a footnote here in your translation that explains how in that culture it was considered very shameful for a woman to be barren (see Gen 30:23). (See: figs-hyperbole)

 
Gen 30:2 And Jacob’s anger burned against Rachel, and he said, “Am I in the place of God, who has kept the fruit of the womb from you?”

And Jacob’s anger burned against Rachel, and he said, 
“Jacob’s anger flared up against Rachel, and/so he said/responded {to her},” or “Jacob became very angry with Rachel and said/responded,” Some languages have an idiom that is similar to the Hebrew idiom here. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-idiom)

“Am I in the place of God, who has kept the fruit of the womb from you?”
“I am not in the place of God, who has kept/prevented you from having children!” or “I am not God! He is the one who has kept/prevented you from having children!” Jacob uses a rhetorical question here to show that he is upset with Rachel and to strongly emphasize his point. Do what is best in your language to communicate this. (See: figs-rquestion)


Gen 30:3 Then she said, “Behold my servant woman Bilhah. Go to her, so that she will bear {children} on my knees, and I also will be built up from her.” 

Then she said,
“Then Rachel told {him},” or “Rachel replied {to him},” (See: writing-quotations)

“Behold my servant woman Bilhah. 
“Here is my servant Bilhah.” or “You can take/have my servant Bilhah {as a/another wife}.”

Go to her, 
“Sleep with her,” or “Have marital relations with her,” See how you translated this euphemism in Gen 16:2. (See: figs-euphemism)

so that she will bear {children} 
“so that she will/can give birth {to children}” or “so that she will/can have children”

on my knees, 
“{for me} {who will sit} on my knees/lap” or “as my surrogate/substitute” or “for me”. The idiom “bear children on my knees” means that Bilhah’s children would be considered Rachel’s children. It may come from the custom of immediately putting a newborn child on the lap of the father and mother to symbolize that the child belonged to them. (See: figs-idiom)

and I also will be built up from her.”
“so that from/through her {children} I too can/will build/have a family.” or “so that I too can/will build/have a family.” See how you translated “built up from her” in Gen 16:2.


Gen 30:4 And she gave to him Bilhah her maidservant as a wife, and Jacob went to her.

And she gave to him Bilhah her maidservant 
“So Rachel gave Jacob her servant/maid Bilhah”. See how you translated “maidservant” in Gen 29:24, 29. Also see how you translated a different word (“servant woman”) in verse 3 that has the same meaning. Some translations use the same term in both verses to prevent confusion. Do what is best in your language.

as a wife,
“as {his} wife,” or “to be {a/another} wife {for him},” Make sure your translation does not sound like Bilhah replaced Rachel as Jacob’s wife; Bilhah was an additional wife.

and Jacob went to her.
“and Jacob slept with her.” or “and Jacob had marital relations with her.” See how you translated “go to” in verse 3 and “went to” in Gen 16:3. (See: figs-euphemism)

Gen 30:5 Then Bilhah conceived and bore a son for Jacob,

Then Bilhah conceived 
“Then Bilhah became pregnant”

and bore a son for Jacob,
“and gave birth to a son for Jacob” or “and had a son for Jacob”
 

Gen 30:6 and Rachel said, “God has vindicated me, and indeed, he has listened to my voice and given to me a son!” For that {reason} she called his name Dan.

and Rachel said,
“and Rachel exclaimed,” or “Then Rachel said/exclaimed,” Consider whether it is more natural here in your language to begin a new sentence here, or to continue the sentence from verse 5. (See: writing-quotations)

“God has vindicated me, 
“God has judged in my favor!” Some translations have “judged me” here. However, make sure your translation of this phrase has a positive meaning (making a decision in Rachel’s favor) and not a negative meaning (condemning her).

and indeed, he has listened to my voice and given to me a son!” 
“Yes indeed, he has heard/answered my prayer/request/plea and given me a son!”

For that {reason} 
“That is why” or “Because of that”

she called his name 
“she called/named him” or “she gave him the name” or “she named her baby/son”. Make sure it is clear here in your translation that Rachel is naming Bilhah’s son, not God (who was the subject of the previous sentence). See how you translated “called his name” in Gen 29:32.

Dan.
“Dan, {which means “he vindicated.”}” or “Dan, {which means “he judged in my favor.”}” If you include the meaning of Dan’s name in your translation (or in a footnote), make sure it matches the way you translated “he has vindicated” earlier in this verse. (See: translate-names)

Gen 30:7 Then Bilhah the maidservant of Rachel conceived again and bore a second son for Jacob.

Then Bilhah the maidservant of Rachel conceived again 
“Then Rachel’s servant Bilhah became pregnant again”. See how you translated verse 5 which is very similar to verse 7.

and bore a second son for Jacob. 
“and gave birth to a second son for Jacob.” or “and had a second son for Jacob.” 


Gen 30:8 So Rachel said, “{With} mighty wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister. Indeed I have prevailed!” And she called his name Naphtali.

So Rachel said,
“So/Then Rachel exclaimed,”

“{With} mighty wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister.
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean (1) “I have had a mighty/difficult struggle/contest with my sister” or “I have struggled intensely/hard with/against my sister”. That would be the meaning if the Hebrew word “elohim” in this phrase is used as an adjective that means “mighty/powerful”. (2) “I have wrestled/struggled with God because of my sister”, which could refer to a struggle against her sister praying to God for children. That would be the meaning if the word “elohim” in this phrase means “God”.

Indeed I have prevailed!” 
“and I have won!” or “and/but now I have defeated her!” or “and/but now I am prevailing/winning!”

And she called his name 
“And/So she called/named him” or “Then/So she called/named that son” or “So she gave him the name”. See how you translated “called his name” in verse 6.

Naphtali.
“Naphtali, {which means “my struggle/contest.”}” As always, if you include the meaning of a name in your translation or in a footnote, make sure that it matches the text that the name is based on. (See: translate-names)

Gen 30:9 Now Leah saw that she had ceased from bearing {children}, so she took Zilpah her maidservant and gave her to Jacob as a wife.

Now Leah saw that she had ceased from bearing {children}, so
“When Leah saw/realized that she had stopped bearing/having children,” See how you translated a similar clause in verse 1.

she took Zilpah her maidservant 
“she took/brought her servant Zilpah {to Jacob}”

and gave her to Jacob as a wife.
“and gave her to Jacob/him as {his} wife.” or “and gave her to Jacob/him to be {another} wife {for him}.” See how you translated “gave...as a wife” in verse 4.


Gen 30:10 Then Zilpah the maidservant of Leah bore a son for Jacob,

Then Zilpah the maidservant of Leah 
“Then Leah’s maidservant Zilpah” or “Then Zilpah”. See how you translated verses 5-8, which are very similar in structure to verses 10-13.

bore a son for Jacob,
“gave birth to a son for Jacob,” or “had a son for Jacob,” 


Gen 30:11 and Leah said, “What good fortune!” So she called his name Gad.

and Leah said, 
“and Leah exclaimed,” (See: writing-quotations)

“What good fortune!”
“What good luck!” or “I am so/very fortunate/lucky!”

So she called his name 
“So she called/named him” or “So she called/named him” or “So she gave him the name”

Gad.

Gen 30:13 and Leah said, “How blessed I am! For women will call me blessed.” So she called his name Asher.

and Leah said, 
“and Leah exclaimed,” (See: writing-quotations)

“How blessed I am! 
“I am truly/greatly blessed!” or “{God} has truly/greatly blessed me!” Although many translations have “happy” in this verse instead of “blessed”, the Hebrew noun (and the verb it is based on) is more general and has to do with a person’s blessed state (which results in joy and happiness). The same Hebrew word is used in Psalm 1:1, and the equivalent Greek word is used in Luke 1:48 and Matthew 5:3-11. 

For women will call me blessed.”
“Now {other} women will say that I am blessed.” or “Now {other} women will say that {God} has blessed me.”

So she called his name
“So she called/named him” or “So she named that son” or “So she gave him the name”

Gen 30:14 Then in the days of the wheat harvest, Reuben went out and found mandrakes in the field, and he brought them to Leah his mother. Then Rachel said to Leah, “Please give to me some of your son’s mandrakes.”

Then in the days of
“Then {one day} during” or “{One day} during”

the wheat harvest, 
“the season/time when people were harvesting wheat/grain/crops,” Wheat is a type of grain that is ground into flour to make bread, which was one of the people’s main foods. The harvest time for wheat in that part of the world is in March and April.

Reuben went out 
“{Leah’s son} Reuben went out”

and found mandrakes in the field, 
“and found {some} {fertility/love plants called} mandrakes in a field,” or “in a field and found {some} fertility/love plants {there},” The roots of mandrake plants were used to help people be more fertile. If mandrakes are not known in your language area, you could describe them as a kind of fertility plant. You could also put information about mandrakes in a footnote or glossary. (See: translate-unknown)

and he brought them to Leah his mother. 
“and he took/gave them to his mother.” or “and he took/gave the plants to his mother.”

Then Rachel said to Leah, 
“{When Rachel found out about the plants,} she asked/begged Leah,”

“Please give to me some of your son’s mandrakes.”
“Please give me some of the fertility/love plants that your son found.” See how you translated “mandrakes” earlier in this verse. (See: translate-unknown)


Gen 30:15 But she said to her, “Is it a small matter you have taken my husband? And would you also take my son’s mandrakes?” Then Rachel said, “Therefore he may lie with you tonight for your son’s mandrakes.”

But she said to her,
“But Leah replied to her,” of “But Leah retorted,” or “But Leah scolded her,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Is it a small matter you have taken my husband?
“{No!} It was {bad} enough that you took/stole my husband {from me}!” or “You already took/stole my husband {from me}!” Leah uses two rhetorical questions in verse 15 to scold Rachel and show how upset she is with her. Consider whether or not rhetorical questions are the best way to communicate that in your language. (See: figs-rquestion)

And would you also take my son’s mandrakes?”
“Do you also/even want to take my son’s fertility/love plants?” or “And/So {now} you also/even want to take/steal my son’s fertility/love plants!” (See: figs-rquestion)

Then Rachel said, 
“Rachel said/replied {to her/Leah},” (See: writing-quotations)

“Therefore 
“Alright then,” or “Very well,” Rachel’s response shows that she realizes that even though Leah was scolding her, she was also bargaining with her.

I have learned by divination 
“{because} I have found out from observing signs” or “{because} I have learned from observation/experience”. The word “divination” refers to trying to find out information by looking at signs (omens) and interpreting them either by God’s power (Gen 44:5, 15) or by witchcraft and false gods (Ezekiel 21:21). Laban may have consulted his household gods (mentioned in Gen 31:19, 30). It could also be that Laban meant that he had figured this out simply by observing how God had blessed him through Jacob’s expert tending of his flocks.

that Yahweh has blessed me 
“that Yahweh has caused me to prosper”

because of you.”
“because you {are here with me}.” or “because you {have been working for me}.”


Gen 30:28 Then he said, “Name your wages to me, and I will give {them}.”

Then he said,
“Then he said {to him,}” or “Then he/Laban added,” Some translations delete this quote margin, since the same person is still speaking to the same person as in the previous verse. However it could be that there was a pause in the conversation, or the author may want to show that there is a change in topic or emphasize what is said next. So if possible, it is best to keep the quote margin here in your translation. (See: writing-quotations)

“Name your wages to me, and I will give {them}.”
“Tell me what you want your wages/pay to be, and that is what I will give/pay you.” or “Tell me what you want me to pay you, and I will give that to you.” or “Set your wages, and that is what they will be.” See how you translated “wages” in Gen 29:15.


Gen 30:29 And he said to him, “You yourself know how I have served you and how your livestock have been with me.

For {there was} little that was yours before me, and it has prospered to abundance, 
“Before I came, you had very little {wealth}, but now you are prospering abundantly/greatly.” or “The few {animals} that you owned before I came have multiplied/increased dramatically/greatly.” or “Before I worked for you, you owned very few animals, but now you have a huge/large number of animals.”

“Let me go/look through all your flock{s} today” or “Today I will go/look through all your sheep and goats”

“and separate out from them” or “and take away from them”

every speckled and spotted lamb and every dark-colored lamb among the sheep, 
“all the lambs that are speckled, spotted or dark-colored,” or “all the lambs that have speckles or spots, or that are dark-colored,” The Hebrew word for “speckled” refers to small spots, whereas “spotted” refers to medium-sized and bigger spots. In that part of the world, most sheep were white and most goats were solid brown or black. So Jacob was asking for the irregular animals for himself, including white sheep with dark marks, dark-colored goats with light marks and dark-colored lambs. You could put some of this information in a footnote.

and the spotted and speckled {young} among the goats. 
“and {all} the young/kid goats that are spotted or speckled.”

And that will be my wages.
“They will be my wages/pay.” or “Those animals will be my wages/pay.”
 

Gen 30:33 So my righteousness will testify for me in future days when you go over my wages in front of you: any that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and dark-colored among the sheep, it was stolen {if it is} with me.”

So my righteousness will testify for me in future days 
“Also, in the future you will know whether or not I am being righteous/honest” or “That way {too}, in the future it will be easy {for you/everyone} to know whether {or not} I am being honest”. The phrase “my righteousness” is referred to here as if it can testify like a person can. Some languages cannot personify righteousness like that. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-personification)

when you go over my wages in front of you: 
“whenever you check the animals you have paid/given me.” For some languages it is more natural to move this clause earlier in this sentence and say, “Also, in the future, whenever you check the animals you have paid/given me, you will know whether or not I am being honest.” Do what is best in your own language. (See: figs-infostructure)

any that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and dark-colored among the sheep, 
“{If you see} that I have any {sheep or} goats that are not speckled or spotted, or any sheep/lambs that are not dark-colored,” or “{If you see/find} any {sheep or} goats {among my flocks} that do not have speckles or spots, or any sheep/lambs that are not dark-colored,”

it was stolen {if it is} with me.”
“{you will know that} I stole them {from you}.” or “{it will be obvious that} I stole them {from you}.”

Gen 30:34 And Laban said, “Behold, let it be according to your word.”

And Laban said, 
“Laban said/replied {to him},” (See: writing-quotations)

“Behold, 
“I agree.” or “Yes,” or “I agree with that;”

let it be according to your word.”
“let’s do exactly as/what you have said/suggested.” or “we should/will do exactly as/what you have said/suggested.”


Gen 30:35 Then on that day he removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, any that {had} white on it, and all the dark-colored {ones} among the lambs. Then he gave {them} into the hand of his sons, 

Then on that day 
“But that {same/very} day,” What Laban does in verse 35 does not follow the agreement he just made with Jacob in verses 32-34. (See: grammar-connect-logic-contrast)

he removed 
“Laban removed/separated {from his flocks}”. Make sure it is clear in your translation that this phrase refers to Laban, not Jacob (as verse 36 confirms).

the male goats that were streaked and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, 
“{all} the he-goats that had streaks or spots, and all the she-goats that had speckles or spots,”

any that {had} white on it, 
“any/all that {had any} white {marks} on them,” The goats were normally dark brown or black, so if they had streaks or spots on them those marks would be white. In the Hebrew text, there is a pun (play-on-words) in verses 35 and 37: the name “Laban” means “white”, so verse 35 literally says that any goats with “Laban” (“white”) on them became Jacob’s. You could include that information in a footnote.

and all the dark-colored {ones} among the lambs.
“together with all the dark-colored lambs.” or “as well as all the lambs that were dark-colored.”

Then he gave {them} into the hand of his sons,
“Then he had his sons tend {them},” or “Then he put his sons in charge of {them},” or “Then he told his sons to take care of {them},” (See: figs-idiom)


Gen 30:36 and he put a three-day journey between himself and Jacob. And Jacob was tending the rest of Laban’s flock{s}.

and he put a three-day journey between himself and Jacob. 
“and he {and his sons} took {those animals} a three-day walking distance away from Jacob.”

And Jacob was tending the rest of Laban’s flock{s}.
“Meanwhile Jacob continued taking care of the rest of Laban’s flock{s}.” See how you translated “tending” in verse 31 and Gen 13:7.

Gen 30:37 Then Jacob took for himself fresh-cut branches of poplar and almond and plane trees, and peeled white stripes in them, exposing the white that {was} inside the branches. 

Then Jacob took for himself fresh-cut branches 
“Then Jacob cut {some} branches”

of poplar and almond and plane trees, 
“from poplar {trees}, almond/hazel {trees} and plane/chestnut {trees},” or “from three different kinds of trees,” If the three kinds of trees are not known in your language area, you could transliterate the names of the trees, or be more general and leave out the names (if they are too distracting). (See: translate-unknowns)

and peeled white stripes in them, 
“and peeled/stripped off long strips/pieces of bark,” or “and made white stripes/streaks on them {by stripping/peeling off long strips/pieces of bark},”

exposing the white that {was} inside the branches.
“which exposed/showed the white {wood} under the bark.” or “so that the white {wood} that was inside the branches was exposed/showing.”


Gen 30:38 Then he put the branches that he had peeled in the troughs, in the water troughs where the flock{s} came to drink, in front of the flock{s}. And they were in heat when they came to drink,

Then he put the branches that he had peeled in the troughs,
“Then he put/set those {striped/streaked} branches in all the {stone} drinking/watering troughs/tubs/places”. See how you translated “trough” in Gen 24:20.

in the water troughs where the flock{s} came to drink, 
“where the flock{s} came to drink,” or “that the flock{s} would come to drink from,” The way you translate this should allow for the fact that the animals came to the watering troughs repeatedly or regularly throughout the day, not just one time.

in front of the flock{s}. 
“in front of them.” or “so that the flock{s} would see the branches {there}.”

And they were in heat when they came to drink,
“The flocks {often} mated when they came {to the troughs/tubs} to drink,” or “{That way, whenever} the animals that were ready to mate/breed came {to the troughs/tubs} to drink,” The way you translate this clause will determine whether you begin the next verse with a conjunction (“and” or “so”) or without a conjunction. Do what is best in your language.


Gen 30:39 and the flock{s} would mate by the branches, and the flock{s} would bear streaked, speckled and spotted {young}. 

and the flock{s} would mate by the branches, 
“and/so they would mate in front of the branches,” or “they would mate where they could see the branches,” or “they would see the branches as they were mating/breeding,” Make sure your translation of the verbs in this verse refers to a repeated or habitual activity, not a one-time event.

and the flock{s} would bear streaked, speckled and spotted {young}.
“As a result, they would bear/have {young/offspring that were} streaked or speckled or spotted.” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. See how you translated “speckled” and “spotted” in verses 32-33 and 35. Also consider what is the most natural way in your language to refer to the flocks in verses 38 and 39. (See: writing-pronouns)


Gen 30:40 Then Jacob set apart the lambs, and he made the faces of the flock{s} look at the streaked and all the dark-colored {animals} in the flock{s} of Laban. And he put flocks for himself by themselves, and he did not put them with the flock{s} of Laban.

Then Jacob set apart the lambs, 
“Then Jacob separated those young animals {from Laban’s flocks} {to form/make new flocks for himself},” (See: figs-explicit)

and he made the faces of the flock{s} look at 
“and he put {the rest of} the flock{s} with”. The Hebrew text uses an idiom here that means Jacob put the marked and unmarked animals together (so that they would mate). (See: figs-idiom)

the streaked and all the dark-colored {animals} 
“all the streaked animals and dark-colored {animals}”. See how you translated “streaked” in verses 35 and 39, and how you translated “dark-colored” in verses 32-33 and 35.

in the flock{s} of Laban. 
“{that were} in Laban’s flock{s} {so that they would mate and have young/offspring/babies that were streaked or dark-colored}.” You may need to make it explicit in your translation why Jacob put the unmarked sheep and goats with Laban’s streaked and spotted animals, so that people understand what Jacob was doing. (See: figs-explicit)
 
And he put flocks for himself by themselves, 
“In that way, {over time} he created/formed/made separate flocks {of sheep and goats} for himself”

and he did not put them with the flock{s} of Laban.
“that he did not put/mix with Laban’s flock{s}.” or “that he kept separate/away from Laban’s flock{s}.”

Gen 30:41 So it happened whenever the strong animals were in heat, then Jacob put the branches in the troughs before the eyes of the flocks so that they would mate by the branches.

So it happened whenever 
“So whenever” or “Whenever”. This verse includes more details about what Jacob was doing on a regular basis.

the strong animals
“the stronger/best female animals” or “the strong/hardy/robust female sheep and goats”

were in heat,
“were ready to mate/breed,” See how you translated this phrase in verse 38. 

then Jacob put the branches in the troughs 
“Jacob put/set the {striped/streaked} branches in the {drinking/watering} troughs/tubs”. See how you translated a similar clause in verse 38.

before the eyes of the flocks so that they would mate by the branches.
“in front of those animals so that they would see the branches as they were mating/breeding.” or “so that as they were mating, they would see the branches.” See how you translated “mate” and “the branches” in verse 39. (See: grammar-connect-logic-purpose)


Gen 30:42 But when the animals were weak, he did not put {them} {in}. So it was the weak {ones} {went} to Laban, and the strong {ones} to Jacob,

But when the animals were weak, 
“But whenever the weak/feeble female animals {were ready to mate/breed},” (See: grammar-connect-logic-contrast)

he did not put {them} {in}. 
“Jacob did not put/set {the branches} {in the troughs/tubs}.” (See: figs-explicit)

So it was 
“In that way,” (See: grammar-connect-logic-result)

the weak {ones} 
“{the young/offspring from} the weaker/feeble {animals}” (See: figs-explicit)

{went} to Laban,
“were Laban’s,” or “{had no streaks or spots and} remained in Laban’s flocks,”

and the strong {ones} 
“and/whereas {the young/offspring from} the stronger/hardy/robust {animals}”. See how you translated “strong” in verse 41. (See: figs-explicit)

to Jacob,
“{went} to Jacob,” or “were Jacob’s,” or “{had streaks and spots and} became part of Jacob’s {flocks},”


Gen 30:43 so that the man prospered very greatly, and he owned large flock{s}, and maidservants and menservants, and camels and donkeys.

so that the man 
“So Jacob” or “As a result, Jacob”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

prospered very greatly, 
“became extremely wealthy”. See how you translated “prospered” in verse 30.

and he owned large flock{s}, 
“and owned large flock{s} {of sheep and goats},” or “He owned many sheep and goats,” For some languages it is more natural to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language. 

and maidservants and menservants, and camels and donkeys.
“and {many} male and female servants, and {many} camels and donkeys.” See how you translated “maidservants”, “menservants”, “camels”, and “donkeys” in Gen 12:16 and 24:35.
