38:1-30 Judah And Tamar

Gen 38:1 And it happened at that time that Judah went down from with his brothers and settled near an Adullamite man, and his name {was} Hirah.

And it happened at that time that Judah went down from with his brothers 
“Meanwhile Judah left his brothers and went down”. The phrase “And it happened” introduces a new episode here. Some translations leave it implied. Do what is best in your language. (See: writing-newevent)

and settled near an Adullamite man,
“and settled/stayed/lived in {the town of} Adullam near {the home of} a man from there” or “to {the town of} Adullam and settled/stayed/lived near {the home of} a man from there”. The word “Adullamite” refers to the fact that Hirah was from the town of Adullam; it is not the name of a people group. The town of Adullam was about 19 kilometers (12 miles) northwest of the city of Hebron (37:14), and was lower in elevation, which is why the text says that Judah “went down” to get there.

and his name {was} Hirah. 
“whose name {was} Hirah.”


Gen 38:2 And there Judah saw the daughter of a Canaanite man, and his name {was} Shua, and he took her. Then he went to her, 

And there 
“{While he was living} there,” 

Judah saw the daughter of a Canaanite man, and his name {was} Shua, 
“Judah/he met the daughter of a Canaanite man named Shua” or “Judah/he met a Canaanite woman whose father {was} Shua,”

and he took her. 
“and he took her {as his wife}.” or “and he married her.” See how you translated a similar idiom (“took a wife”) in Gen 25:1. (See: figs-idiom)

Then he went to her, 
“Then he slept/lay with her,” or “Then he had {marital/sexual} relations with her,” See how you translated the idiom “went to” in Gen 6:4. (See: figs-euphemism)


Gen 38:3 and she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er.

and she conceived 
“and she became pregnant” 

and bore a son, 
“and gave birth to a son” or “When she gave birth, she had a son,” Consider whether or not it is better to begin a new sentence here in your language.

and he called his name Er. 
“whom he/Judah named Er.” Throughout Genesis, sometimes the father, sometimes the mother, and sometimes both are said to give their child his name.


Gen 38:4 Then she conceived again and bore a son, and she called his name Onan. 

Then she conceived again 
“Then Judah’s wife became pregnant again”. See how you translated verse 3, which is similar to verse 4.

and bore a son, 
“and gave birth to {another} son,” 

and she called his name Onan.
“and she named him Onan.”


Gen 38:5 Then she continued further and bore a son, and she called his name Shelah. And he was in Kezib when she bore him.

Then she continued further 
“Then she conceived again” or “Then she became pregnant yet again”

and bore a son, 
“and gave birth to {another} son,”

and she called his name Shelah. 
“and she named him Shelah.”

And he was in Kezib when she bore him.
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “He/Judah was in/at {the town of} Kezib when she gave birth to Shelah.” (2) “It was in {the town of} Kezib that she gave birth to him/Shelah.” or “She was in Kezib when she gave birth to him/Shelah.” For some languages it is more natural to change the order of the clauses in this sentence and say, “When she gave birth to Shelah, Judah/she was in {the town of} Kezib.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 38:6 Then Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name {was} Tamar.

Then Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name {was} Tamar.
“Years later, Judah got/chose a wife named Tamar for his firstborn/oldest son Er.” or “When Judah’s firstborn/oldest son Er grew up, Judah arranged/negotiated for him to marry a woman whose name {was} Tamar.” See how you translated the phrase “took a wife for” in Gen 21:21.


Gen 38:7 But Er, the firstborn of Judah, was evil in the eyes of Yahweh, so Yahweh killed him.

But Er, the firstborn of Judah, 
“But Judah’s firstborn/oldest son Er” or “But Er”. Some languages leave “the firstborn of Judah” implied here since Er was already called the firstborn in verse 6. The Hebrew text repeats that information here to emphasize Er’s relationship to Judah in the following events. Do what is best in your language.

was evil in the eyes of Yahweh, 
“did things that were evil/wicked in Yahweh’s sight/opinion,” or “did something/things that Yahweh considered/judged to be evil/wicked,” The Hebrew text does not specify what Er had done wrong, so neither should your translation. See how you translated the idiom “in the eyes of Yahweh” in Gen 6:8. (See: figs-idiom)

so Yahweh killed him.
“so Yahweh took his life.” or “so Yahweh caused him to die.”

Gen 38:8 Then Judah said to Onan, “Go to the wife of your brother and perform your duty to her and produce offspring for your brother.”

Then Judah said to Onan,
“After that, Judah told {his son} Onan,”

“Go to the wife of your brother
“Marry your brother’s wife/widow {Tamar} {according to our custom}”. The Israelites practiced the custom of Levirate marriage, which meant that if a man died without any children, it was his oldest brother’s duty to marry his widow and have a son together who would carry on the deceased man’s family line and inherit his estate (see Deuteronomy 25:5-6). You could put some of that information in a footnote.

and perform your duty to her 
“so that you fulfill your duty/obligation to her {as her brother-in-law}”

and produce offspring 
“and produce/have children {with her}”

for your brother.”
for your {deceased} brother.” or “to carry on {the name of} your brother {Er}.”


Gen 38:9 However Onan knew that the offspring would not be his, so it happened when he went to the wife of his brother, then he spilled {it} on the ground so that he would not give offspring to his brother.

However Onan knew that the offspring would not be his, 
“However/But Onan knew that the children {they would have together} would not belong to him.”

so it happened when 
“So whenever” or “So every time” 

he went to
“he slept/lay with” or “he had {marital/physical} relations with” (See: figs-euphemism)

the wife of his brother,
“his brother’s wife/widow {Tamar},” or “Tamar,”

then he spilled {it} on the ground 
“he wasted {his semen} on the ground” or “he caused/let {his semen} to spill/go on the ground”. Translate this clause in a way that is polite and will not shame or embarrass people when this verse is read aloud in public. Make sure it is clear that Onan did something to keep Tamar from getting pregnant.

so that he would not give offspring to his brother.
“so that he would not have offspring/children for his brother.” or “to keep her from {getting pregnant and} having {any} offspring/children for his brother.” 


Gen 38:10 And what he did was evil in the eyes of Yahweh, so he killed him also.

And what he did was evil in the eyes of Yahweh, 
“Yahweh considered/judged what he/Onan did to be evil/wicked,” or “But that was evil/wicked in Yahweh’s sight/opinion,” See how you translated “evil in the eyes of Yahweh” in verse 7.

so he killed him also.
“so he/Yahweh took his life too/also.” or “so he/Yahweh caused him to die too.”

Gen 38:11 Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, “Remain a widow in the house of your father until Shelah my son grows up.” For he said, “So that he does not also die like his brothers!” So Tamar went and lived in the house of her father.

Then Judah said to 
“Then Judah told”

Tamar his daughter-in-law,
“his daughter-in-law Tamar,” or “his son’s widow Tamar,” or “Tamar,”

“Remain a widow in the house of your father 
“{Go back} to your father’s house and stay there as a widow” or “{Go and} live at your father’s house, and do not marry again”

until Shelah my son grows up.”
“until my son Shelah is old enough {to marry you}.”

For he said, “So that he does not also die like his brothers!”
“{He said/did that} because he said/thought {to himself}, “I don’t want Shelah to die like his brothers did!” “ or “{He did/said that} because he was afraid Shelah would die like his brothers had.” or “{Actually Judah did not want Shelah to marry Tamar} because he was afraid/worried {that if he did,} he would also die like his brothers had.” 

So Tamar went and lived in the house of her father.
“So Tamar went {home} to her father’s house and live/stayed there.”

Gen 38:12 Then the days were many, and Shua’s daughter, the wife of Judah, died. Then Judah was comforted, and he went up to Timnah, to {the men} who were shearing his sheep, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. 

Then the days were many, and 
“Many years later,” or “After a long time,” or “Years went by and then”

Shua’s daughter, the wife of Judah, died.
“Judah’s wife, the daughter of Shua, died.” or “Judah’s wife, {who was} Shua’s daughter, died.” Notice that Shua was the father of Judah’s wife. Be consistent here with how you spelled his name in verse 2.

Then Judah was comforted, and 
“After Judah finished mourning/grieving {for her}, {one day}” or “After Judah had completed the {customary} time of mourning/grieving {for her},” See how you translated “comforted” in Gen 37:35.

he went up to Timnah,
“he {decided to} go to {the town of} Timnah”. Make sure your translation of this clause does not sound like Judah had already arrived at Timnah, because he does not actually reach there until verse 19. His trip from the town of Adullam (verse 1) to the town of Timnah was about 13 kilometers (8 miles).

to {the men} who were shearing his sheep,
“{to work} with {the men} who were shearing his sheep {there}.” or “where {his men} were shearing his sheep {for him}.” See how you translated “shear his sheep” in Gen 31:19 and see the note about that there.

he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite. 
“He and his friend Hirah, {who was} from {the town of} Adullam, {started traveling there together}.” or “His friend Hirah the Adullamite went/traveled with him.” For some languages it may be clearer or more natural to put this clause earlier in this verse and say, “...and he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite went up to {the town of} Timnah where men were shearing Judah’s sheep {for him}.” Do what is best in your language. Also, be consistent here with how you spelled “Hirah” and how you translated “Adullamite” in verse 1. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 38:13 And it was told to Tamar, saying, “Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.”

And it was told to Tamar, saying, 
“Then/Meanwhile someone told/informed Tamar,” (See: figs-activepassive)

“Behold, your father-in-law
“Listen, your father-in-law {Judah}”

is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.”
“is on his way to {the town of} Timnah to shear his sheep.” or “is on his way to shear his sheep in/at {the town of} Timnah.” See how you translated “shearing his sheep” in verse 12. 


Gen 38:14 So she took off her widow’s clothes from on her and covered herself with a veil and wrapped herself. Then she sat at the entrance of Enaim, which {is} on the road to Timnah, because she saw that Shelah had grown up, but she had not been given to him as a wife.

So she took off her widow’s clothes from on her 
“So she changed from her clothes that showed she was a widow” or “So she changed {into different clothes} from the kind of clothes that widows wear”. Make sure it is clear in your translation that Tamar did not just take off her widow’s clothes, but that she also put different clothes on. (See: figs-explicit)

and covered herself with a veil 
“and covered herself with a {large} veil/shawl” or “and covered her face with a {thin} veil/headscarf”. A veil was a large piece of thin cloth that was used to cover the face and/or the body. See how you translated “veil” in Gen 24:65.

and wrapped herself.
“and dressed/disguised herself {as/like a prostitute}.” or “to disguise herself.”

Then she sat at the entrance of Enaim, which {is} on the road to Timnah,
“Then she sat near/by the entrance/gateway to {the town of} Enaim, which {was} on the road/way to/toward {the town of} Timnah” or “Then {she went/traveled} toward {the town of} Timnah and sat down at/near the entrance/gateway of {the town of} Enaim, which {was} along the way.” Some languages need to specify that Tamar traveled to Enaim before she sat down there. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-explicit)

because she saw that Shelah had grown up, 
“{She did that} because she had noticed that Shelah was now old enough {to marry},” 

but she had not been given to him as a wife.
“but Judah had not given her to him/Shelah to marry {as he was supposed/required to do}.” For some languages it is more natural to change the order of clauses in this sentence and say, “Tamar had seen/noticed that Shelah was now grown up, but Judah had not given her to him to marry {as he was supposed/required to do}. So she changed from her widow’s clothes....” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

Gen 38:15 Then Judah saw her, and he thought she was a prostitute because she had covered her face. 

Then Judah saw her, 
“{As Judah was traveling to Timnah,} he saw Tamar {beside the road},”

and he thought she was a prostitute because she had covered her face. 
“but since she had covered/veiled her face {with a veil/shawl}, {he could not see who she was and} he thought/assumed that she was a prostitute.” See how you translated “prostitute” in Gen 34:31 and “covered her face” in verse 14. (See: figs-explicit)
 

Gen 38:16 So he turned to her beside the road and said, “Please come, let me come to you,” because he did not know that she {was} his daughter-in-law. And she said, “What will you give to me if you will come to me?”

So he turned to her beside the road 
“So he went over to where she was {sitting} beside/by the road” (See: figs-explicit)

and said, 
“and said {to her},” or “and asked {her},”

“Please come, let me come to you,” 
“Let me sleep/lie with you.” or “Let me have relations/sex with you.” (See: figs-euphemism)

because he did not know that she {was} his daughter-in-law. 
“{He did/said that} because he did not recognize/realize that she {was} his daughter-in-law {Tamar}.” For some languages it is more natural to put this clause first in this sentence and say, “He did not realize that she was his daughter-in-law {Tamar}, so he went over to her beside the road and said,...”

And she said, 
“So she asked {him},” (See: writing-quotations)

“What will you give to me

if you will 
“if I allow you to” or “so that you can”

And he said, 
“He answered {her},” (See: writing-quotations)

“I will send a kid goat from the flock.” 
“I will send {you} a young goat from my flock.” See how you translated “kid goat” in Gen 27:9, 16.

And she said, 
“She replied,” 

“If you will give a pledge 
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “{Ok,} if you will give {me} a pledge/deposit...” or “{I will agree,} if you give {me} something {valuable} {of yours} to keep...” (2) “Will you give me a pledge/deposit...?”

“until you send/deliver {the goat to me}.”


Gen 38:18 Then he said, “What {is} the pledge that I should give to you?” And she said, “Your signet and your cord and your staff that {is} in your hand.” So he gave {them} to her and went to her, and she conceived by him.

Then he said, 
“So Judah asked {her},” (See: writing-quotations)

“What {is} the pledge that I should give to you?” 
“What should I give to you as a pledge/deposit?” or “What do you want me to leave with you?”

And she said, 
“She answered {him},”

“Your signet and your cord 
“{Leave/Give me} your {name/identification/signature} seal/thing with its cord/string {that you have/wear around your neck},” A “signet” or “identification seal” was a ring or small cylinder-shaped object that had the owner’s name engraved on it and was worn around his neck on a cord. It was used to prove his identity and to sign documents that were written on clay tablets, by rolling the cylinder over the soft clay. If people in your culture are not familiar with these things, you could put some of this information in a footnote. (See: translate-unknown)

See Gen 6:4 (see note); 16:2, 4; 19:31; 30:3-4; 38:2, 8-9, 16, 18. It may be necessary to translate this phrase in different ways, depending on the context; for example, the relationship in Gen 38:16, 18 was outside of marriage. (See: figs-euphemism)

and she conceived by him.
“and she became pregnant by/from him.” or “and he caused her to become pregnant.” Consider again how you translated “conceive” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 4:1, 17; 16:4-5; 19:36; 21:2; 25:21; 29:32-35; 30:5, 7, 17, 19, 23; 38:3-4, 18.


Gen 38:19 Then she got up and left, and she took off her veil from on her and put on her widow’s clothes.

Then she got up and left,

Gen 38:20 Then Judah sent the kid goat by the hand of his friend the Adullamite to get back the pledge from the hand of the woman, but he did not find her.

Then Judah 
“Meanwhile Judah” or “After that, Judah”

sent the kid goat by the hand of his friend the Adullamite 
“sent a young goat with his friend {Hirah} {who was} from {the town of} Adullam” or “sent his friend {Hirah} the Adullamite with a young goat”. See how you translated “his friend...the Adullamite” in verse 12 and “kid goat” in verse 17.

to get back the pledge from the hand of the woman,
“to retrieve/reclaim his things from the woman/prostitute {whom he had given them to}.” or “to exchange it for the things he had left with the woman/prostitute.” or “to get back from the woman/prostitute the things he had left with her.”

but he did not find her.
“But he/Hirah was not able to find her.” or “But {when he/Hirah looked for her,} he could not find her.”


Gen 38:21 So he asked the men of her place, saying, “Where {is} the temple prostitute who {was} at Enaim beside the road?” But they said, “There has not been a temple prostitute in this place.”

So he asked the men of her place, saying, 
“So he/Hirah asked {some} men {who lived} near the place where she had been,”

“Where {is} the temple prostitute who {was} at Enaim beside the road?” 
“Where {is} the temple/shrine prostitute who {was sitting} beside the road near {the town of} Enaim?” Pagan religions had fertility rites at their temples or shrines that included professional prostitutes. Make sure your translation of “temple prostitute” does not refer to any temple built by the Israelites. Also be consistent here with how you translated “Enaim” in verse 14.

But they said, 
“But they answered {him},”

“There has not been a temple prostitute 
“There has never been a temple/shrine prostitute” or “No temple/shrine prostitute has ever been” 

in this place.”
“in/near this place/town.” or “around here.”


Gen 38:22 So he returned to Judah and said, “I did not find her. And also, the men of the place said, ‘There has not been a temple prostitute in this {place}.’ ”

“claimed, ‘There has never been a temple/shrine prostitute in/near this {place/town}.’ ” or “say/claim that there has never been a temple/shrine prostitute near/around there.” See how you translated this same quote in verse 21. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to translate this as an indirect quote here in verse 22. (See: figs-quotations)


Gen 38:23 And Judah said, “Let her take {the things} for herself so that we do not become a laughingstock. Behold, I sent this kid, but you did not find her.”

“Let her take {the things} for herself
“{Stop looking for her and} let her keep {my things} for herself”

so that we do not become a laughingstock. 
“so that people do not laugh at us.” or “Otherwise everyone will make fun of us.” or “so that we are not publicly shamed.” The pronouns “we” and “us” are inclusive here because Judah is including Hirah; some languages might use a dual pronoun. Use the pronouns that work best in your language in this context. (See: figs-exclusive)

Behold, 
“Besides that,” or “After all,” 

I sent this kid,

“In fact, look, {she is} {now} pregnant from doing that!” or “In fact, as a result of her immoral/indecent behavior {she has become} pregnant!” or “and even worse, {she is} {now} pregnant because of that!”

So Judah said, 
“Judah said/responded {angrily},” (See: writing-quotations)

Gen 38:25 She was being brought out, then she sent {a message} to her father-in-law, saying, “By the man whom these things belong to, I {am} pregnant.” Then she said, “Please identify whose signet and cords and staff these {are}.”

She was being brought out, then 
“{So they went to get her/Tamar, but} as they were taking her out {of the town},”

she sent {a message} to her father-in-law, saying,

“By the man whom these things belong to, I {am} pregnant.” 
“The man who owns these things is the one who got me pregnant.”

Then she said, “Please identify whose signet and cords and staff these {are}.”
“Please identify {the man} who owns this name/identification/signature seal/thing with its cord/string and this walking stick.” or “Please look at this name/identification/signature seal/thing with its cord/string and this walking stick. Do you know/recognize who they belong to?” For some languages it is more natural to omit the quote margin here, since what follows is a continuation of the message Tamar is sending to Judah. Do what is best in your language. See how you translated “signet” and “cord” and “staff” in verse 18. (See: writing-quotations)


Gen 38:26 And Judah identified {the things} and said, “She is more righteous than I {am}, because I did not give her to Shelah my son!” And he did not continue to know her more.

“never again laid/slept with her/Tamar.” or “never had {sexual} relations with her/Tamar again.” Consider again how you translated the idiom “knew” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 4:1 (and note), 17, 25; 19:8; 24:16; 38:26. It may be necessary to translate 38:26 differently, since the relationship in this verse was outside of marriage. Compare how you translated a related idiom (“went to”) in verse 18. (See: figs-euphemism)

Then it happened when {it was} time for her to give birth, 
“Months later, when Tamar {was ready} to give birth,” See how you translated “Then it happened” in verse 24. The same phrase occurs three times in verses 27-29 to draw attention to the peak of this chapter, the birth of Perez, who was the ancestor of King David and the Messiah.

“While she was in labor,” or “As she was starting to deliver her babies,” See how you translated “giving birth” in Gen 35:16. This may need to be translated differently here because of the different context.

then {one} put out a hand, 
“{one of them} stuck out {his} hand” or “{one of the twins/babies} put/stuck out {his} hand”

and the midwife 
“Then/So the midwife {who was there}” or “Then/So the midwife {who was helping her}”. See how you translated “midwife” in Gen 35:17.

took a scarlet thread and tied {it} on his hand, saying,
“tied a {bright} red thread/string on/around his wrist and said,” The midwife did this because it was her responsibility to identify which baby was the firstborn.

“This {one} came out first.”
“This {one/baby} was born first.” 


Gen 38:29 But it happened, when he drew his hand back in, then behold, his brother came out. Then she said, “How have you breached for yourself a breach?” So he called his name Perez.

But it happened, when he drew his hand back in, then behold,
“But then the/that baby pulled his hand back inside, and suddenly/unexpectedly” 

his brother came out.
“his brother came out {first} {instead}.” or “his brother was born {first} {instead}.” (See: figs-explicit)

Then she said, 
“Then/So the midwife said/exclaimed {to the baby},” (See: writing-quotations)

“How have you breached for yourself a breach?”
“How did you break/burst yourself out like that?” or “What a dramatic/powerful way for you to break/burst out!” or “Just look at how you have forced your way out!” The midwife uses a rhetorical question here to emphasize how surprised she is that Perez was born first. Decide the best way to communicate this in your language. (See: figs-rquestion)

So he called his name 
“So he was named” or “That is why they named him”. The Hebrew text has “he called his name” here, which probably refers to Judah (Perez’s father). However most translations are more general and say “he was named” or “they named him”.

Perez.
“Perez, {which means “break/burst out.”}” If you include the meaning of Perez’ name in your translation or in a footnote, make sure it fits with how you translated the previous sentence. (See: translate-names)


Gen 38:30 And afterwards, his brother came out, who {had} the scarlet thread on his hand, and he called his name Zerah.

And afterwards, his brother
“After that, his {twin} brother”

came out,
“was born/delivered”

who {had} the scarlet thread on his hand,
“who {had} the {bright} red thread/string on his wrist.” or “with the {bright} red thread/string on his wrist.” See how you translated “scarlet thread” in verse 28.

and he called his name
“So he was named” or “So they named him”. See how you translated “he called his name” in verse 29.

Zerah.
“Zerah, {which means “brightness.”}”
