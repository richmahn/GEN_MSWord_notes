6:1-8 Evil Increases On the Earth

Gen 6:1 And it happened when mankind began to multiply on the surface of the earth and daughters were born to them, 

And
“Now”. The events in Gen 6:1-2 started happening long before the events in 5:32, so the way your translation begins this verse should allow for that meaning and not begin with a sequence word like “Then”, which would have the wrong meaning here. Many translations omit the conjunction here. Do what is best in your language. (See: grammar-connect-time-background)

it happened when
“it happened that when/as” or “it happened that”. This phrase introduces and emphasizes important background information which the following narrative builds on. It also creates suspense so that readers and listeners wonder what will happen next. Some translations leave this phrase out, but that loses some of the suspense. Do what is best in your language. (See: writing-background)

mankind 
“human beings” or “people”. See how you translated this term in Gen 5:1-2. 

began to multiply
“began to multiply/increase {in number}” or “began to be more/very numerous”

on the surface of the earth
“all over the earth” or “throughout the earth/world”

and daughters were born to them,
“and they were having daughters,”


Gen 6:2 then the sons of God saw the daughters of mankind, that they {were} beautiful, so they took wives for themselves from any {of them} that they chose.

then
“then/Then {when those daughters/girls grew up,}” or “{When those daughters/girls grew up,}” Verses 1 and 2 are one long sentence in the Hebrew text. For many languages it is necessary to divide it into two or more shorter sentences. For example, depending on how you began verse one, you could begin verse 2 with a new sentence. Do what is best in your language. 

the sons of God 
“{some} angels” or “{some} supernatural beings”. The meaning of Gen 6:2 is not certain and is heavily debated, so it is probably best to translate it fairly literally and possibly include a footnote about what it means. If it is not translated literally, the literal text should be put in a footnote. There are three main views of who “the sons of God” and “the daughters of mankind” refer to: (1) nonhuman, god-like beings (supernatural beings), such as angels (as in Job 1:6, 38:7) or demons who took human form and married the daughters of human beings; 1 Peter 3:19–20; 2 Peter 2:4 [HYPERLINK: https://www.esv.org/2%20Pet.%202%3A4/], and Jude 6 [HYPERLINK: https://www.esv.org/Jude%206/] may be referring to this passage. (2) male descendants of Seth (the righteous, chosen family line) who married female descendants of Cain (the unrighteous family line). (3) sons of powerful men, such as judges or rulers (as in Exodus 22:8, Psalm 82:1, 6) who married the daughters of common, poor people.

saw the daughters of mankind, that they {were} beautiful,
“saw that the daughters of human beings {were} beautiful,” or “saw that those young women {were} beautiful,” or “saw that they {were} {very} beautiful,”

so they took wives for themselves from any {of them} that they chose.
“so they married any {of them} that they wanted to.” or “So they chose any/all {of them} that they wanted and married them.” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Also, see how you translated “took/married” in Gen 4:19.


Gen 6:3 Then Yahweh said, “My Spirit will not strive with mankind forever, because they {are} indeed flesh. Therefore their days will be 120 years.”

Then Yahweh said,
“Then/So Yahweh said {to himself},” Only make implied information explicit in your translation if it is necessary to prevent wrong meaning or if your language’s grammar requires it, so that your translation is easier to read and understand. (See: figs-explicit)

“My Spirit 
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean (1) “My Spirit” or “I”, which is a way of God referring to himself (Gen 1:2 is similar). (2) “My spirit”, which could refer to God’s breath that gives life (as in Gen 2:7). If the text is not translated literally, the literal text should be put in a footnote.

will not
“will no longer”

strive with
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) “strive/contend with” or “put up with” man’s rebellion (2) “remain/live with/in”. The interpretation that is not used in your translation could be put in a footnote.

mankind 
“human beings” or “people”

forever,
“always,” It may be more natural to put this term earlier in this sentence and say, “My Spirit will not always strive with mankind,” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

because they {are} indeed flesh.
“because they {are} certainly/very sinful/corrupt.” or “because they {are} only/mere {sinful/corrupt} mortals.” The word “flesh” is used here as an idiom that means human beings are “mortal” (that is, their bodies will die) and that they are “sinful/corrupt”. The two meanings are interrelated since it is because of sin that their bodies die. In this context, the focus is on their corrupt behavior, which is the reason God will send a flood soon. (See: figs-idiom)

Therefore
“So”. Many translations leave this word out. Do what is natural in your language.

their days will be 120 years.”
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) ”they will have 120 years {to repent}.” or “I will give them 120 years {to repent}.” (2) “{from now on,} they/people will have/live {no longer than} 120 years.” The first interpretation seems to best fit the context of God announcing his plan to judge mankind for their sin (verse 7). This would mean that Noah was 480 years old when God said this (about 20 years before he started having sons; Gen 5:32), since the flood came when he was 600 years old (Gen 7:6); you could put some of that information in a footnote. The second interpretation does not fit with the fact that after God said this, many people lived much longer than 120 years, so it does not seem likely that length of life was his meaning here.

Gen 6:4 The Nephilim were on the earth in those days and also after that, when the sons of God went to the daughters of mankind, and they bore children for them. They {were} the mighty {ones} who {were} from long ago, the men of renown.

The Nephilim
“{People called} the Nephilim” or “Giants”. Most translations transliterate (borrow or copy) the Hebrew word “Nephilim” here. The word means “fallen ones” and probably refers to their fallen (sinful) spiritual state. The Nephilim were the descendants of the sons of God and the daughters of mankind. The only other place in the Bible that the Nephilim are mentioned is centuries later in Numbers 13:32-33, where they are identified as evil giants. Based on that, some translations translate “the Nephilim” as “giants” here in Gen 6:4. (See: translate-names) 

were on the earth
“lived on the earth” or “were living on the earth”

in those days and also after that,
“during that time and also later on,” It may be more natural to put this time phrase first in verse 4 and say, “During that time there were Nephilim/giants living on the earth, when...” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

when
“{That was/happened} when”. Consider whether or not it is better to begin a new sentence here in your language.

the sons of God
“angels” or “supernatural beings”. Be consistent here with how you translated this phrase in verse 2, and see the important note about that there.

went to 
“slept with” or “had {marital/sexual} relations with”. Translate this idiom in a way that is polite and will not shame or embarrass people when this verse is read aloud in public. See how you translated a similar idiom (“knew”) in Gen 4:1, 17, 25. (See: figs-euphemism)

the daughters of mankind, 
“the daughters of human beings,” or “human women,” See how you translated this phrase in verse 2.

and they 
“and those women”

bore children for them.
“gave birth to children for them.” or “had children.”

They {were}
“The Nephilim {were}” or “Those/Their children {grew up and} {were/became} {the Nephilim who were}” Make sure it is clear in your translation who is being referred to here. (See: writing-pronouns)

the mighty {ones}
“the powerful men/warriors” or “heroes”

who {were} from long ago,
“who lived a long time ago,” or “who lived many years ago,”

the men of renown.
“{who/and were} famous men.” For some languages it may be more natural to put this phrase earlier in this sentence and say, “They {were} the mighty men of renown who...” or “They {were} the famous mighty men who....”

Gen 6:5 And Yahweh saw that the wickedness of mankind {was} great on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of their hearts {was} only evil all day long.

And Yahweh saw
“Yahweh knew” or “Yahweh was aware”. The verb “saw” is used here as an idiom. Consider whether your language has a similar idiom that would fit well here. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-idiom)

that the wickedness of mankind {was} great on the earth, 
“how wicked/evil mankind/people had become on the earth,” or “that the people on the earth had become very wicked/evil,”

and that every inclination of the thoughts of their hearts 
“and that every intention/desire they had in their hearts/minds” or “and that everything they thought about and desired/wanted”. In Hebrew culture the heart is considered the center of thoughts and desires. Consider whether your language has a similar idiom. (See: figs-idiom)

{was} only evil 
“{was} completely evil”

all day long.
“all the time.” or “constantly.”


Gen 6:6 So Yahweh was sorry that he had made mankind on the earth, and he was grieved in his heart.

So Yahweh 
“As a result, Yahweh/he” or “Yahweh/he” (See: writing-pronouns)

was sorry 
“regretted”

that he had made mankind 
“that he had made/created people/them” or “that he had made/created human beings”. See how you translated “mankind” in verses 1, 3, and 5, and consider whether or not it is best to use a pronoun (“them”) here in your language. (See: writing-pronouns)

on the earth,
“{to live} on the earth,”

and he was grieved in his heart.
“and his heart was filled with pain/sadness/grief.” or “and he was/felt extremely/very sad/grieved.” Consider whether your language has a similar idiom that would fit well here. (See: figs-idiom)


Gen 6:7 Then Yahweh said, “I will wipe away mankind whom I created off the surface of the ground, both mankind and animals, and crawling creatures and the birds of the sky, because I am sorry that I made them.”

Then Yahweh said,
“Then/So Yahweh/he said {to himself},” See how you translated this phrase in verse 3. Also make sure that the way you begin verse 7 fits well with the way you begin verse 6.

“I will wipe away 
“I will wash away” or “I will blot out” or “I will completely wipe/destroy”. Consider whether your language has a similar idiom that would fit well here. (See: figs-idiom)

mankind whom I created off the surface of the ground,
“{all} the human beings whom I created, from the surface of the earth,” or “from the earth {all} the people whom I created,” or “all the human beings I made on the earth,” 

both mankind and animals,
“{In fact,} {I will destroy} {not just/only} {all} the people, but also {all} the animals,” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

and crawling creatures 
“and/including the creatures that crawl/move {on/along the ground}”

and the birds of the sky, 
“and {all} the birds {that fly} in the sky/air,” or “and {all} the birds”

because I am sorry
“because I am sad/grieved” or “because I regret”. See how you translated “was sorry” or “regretted” in verse 6.

that I made them.”
“that I {ever} made/created them.”


Gen 6:8 But Noah found favor in the eyes of Yahweh.
 
But Noah found favor in the eyes of Yahweh.
“But Noah pleased God.” or “But/However Yahweh was pleased with Noah.” The idiom “find favor” means to please someone. And the idiom “in the eyes of” refers to someone’s opinion about something or someone. Consider whether your language has similar idioms that work well here or whether it is better to translate this sentence without an idiom. (See: figs-idiom)


6:9-22 Noah Prepares For The Flood

Gen 6:9 These {are} the generations of Noah: Noah {was} a righteous man. He was without blemish in his generation. Noah walked with God.

These {are} the generations of Noah: 
“This/Here is {more of} the account/record/history of/about Noah and his descendants/family:” or “What follows tells {more} about Noah and his descendants/family:” Some of Noah’s history has already been given in Gen 5:29, 32, and 6:8. What follows tells more about him.

Noah {was}
“He {was}”. Consider whether it is better in your language to use a noun or a pronoun here to refer to Noah. (See: writing-pronouns)

a righteous man.
“an upright/good man.” or “a man who did what was right.” (See: translate-key-terms)
   
He was without blemish in his generation.
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) “He {alone} was blameless/faultless {in God’s eyes} among his contemporaries.” or “Out of all the people living at that time, Noah/he was the only one {whom God considered} blameless.” (2) “He had a blameless/spotless reputation among his contemporaries. or “His contemporaries considered him to be a man of integrity.” The phrase “without blemish” is often used in the Bible to describe animals that have no defects. Here it is used as an idiom that means Noah was “blameless/faultless” in an ethical or moral sense, or that he had good integrity, but it does not mean that he was sinless. Consider whether your language has a similar idiom that would work well here. Also the word “generation” refers to people who live during the same time period. (See: figs-idiom)

Noah walked with God.
“{and} he walked {closely/faithfully} with God.” or “{and} he lived in a close/faithful relationship with God.” Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin a new sentence here. See how you translated this idiom in Gen 5:22, 24. (See: figs-idiom)


Gen 6:10 And Noah fathered three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

And Noah fathered
“Eventually Noah/he fathered/had {his}” or “And {as mentioned before,} Noah/he had”. The fact that Noah fathered/had these three sons was already mentioned in Gen 5:32. Make sure that the way you begin this verse in your translation does not sound like he fathered these sons a second time.

three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
“three sons, {namely} Shem, Ham, and Japheth.” or “three sons, {whose names were} Shem, Ham, and Japheth.”

Gen 6:11 Now the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled {with} violence. 

Now the earth 
“Now {the people of/on} the earth”. The phrase “the earth” is often used in the Bible to refer to the people who live on the earth. Consider whether your language can do the same thing, or whether it is necessary to make that implied information explicit. (See: figs-metonymy)

was corrupt 
“had become corrupt/wicked”

before God, 
“in God’s sight/opinion,” or “according to God’s standards,” (See: figs-idiom)

and the earth was filled {with} violence.
“and they had filled the earth with {their} violence/lawlessness.” or “and all over the earth they were doing violent/lawless things.” This clause forms a parallelism with the previous clause in order to emphasize how evil the people on the earth had become. The two clauses are different enough from each other that, if possible, it is best to keep both parts of the parallelism in your translation. Also be consistent with how you translated “the earth” earlier in this verse. (See: figs-parallelism)


Gen 6:12 And God saw the earth, and behold, it was corrupt, because all flesh on the earth had corrupted their ways.

And God saw
“God saw”. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin this sentence with a conjunction.

the earth, and behold, it was corrupt,
“that {everyone on} the earth was indeed/very corrupt/wicked,” or “how corrupt/wicked {everyone on} the earth had become,” See how you translated “corrupt” and “the earth” in verse 11. (See: figs-metonymy)

because all flesh on the earth
“because all the people on the earth” or “because everyone {living} on earth”. The phrase “all flesh” refers here to all people and probably implies that people are mortal (verse 3). (See: figs-synecdoche)

had corrupted their ways.
“were living corrupt/wicked lives.” or “were {continually} doing wicked/evil things.” or “were {continually} acting/behaving in evil ways.”


Gen 6:13 So God said to Noah, “The end of all flesh has come before me, because the earth is filled {with} violence because of them. So behold, I am destroying them with the earth.

So God said to Noah,
“So/Then God/he said to Noah,”

“The end of all flesh has come before me,
“I have decided to put an end to all human beings,” or “I am going to destroy all flesh/people,” Be consistent here with how you translated “flesh” in verse 12. (See: figs-synecdoche)

because the earth is filled {with} violence because of them.
“because they have filled the earth with {their} violence/lawlessness.” or “because all over the earth they are doing violent/lawless things.” See how you translated “violence” in verse 11.

So behold,
“Now listen,” or “In fact,” This phrase draws extra attention to what God says next. Consider the best way to do that in your language. 

I am destroying them
“I am going to destroy them” or “I plan to destroy them” or “I will destroy”

with the earth.
“as well as {everything else on} the earth.” or “and {everything else on} the earth {too}.” This phrase includes everything on the earth, not just the people. (See: figs-metonym)

Gen 6:14 Make an ark for yourself out of gopher wood. Make the ark {with} rooms, and cover it inside and outside with a covering.

Make 
“{Therefore/Consequently} {you must} make/build” (See: grammar-connect-logic-result)

an ark
“a {very} large boat/houseboat”. The term “ark” is general and refers to a chest/box that is closed on all sides, including the top. In this case, the ark was a very large boat that people and many animals lived in for a year. It had no motor, no oars, no sail and no rudder. Since this was a unique, one-of-a-kind boat that may already be well-known as the “ark” in the receptor language area, some translations transliterate (copy or borrow) the word “ark” throughout Genesis. Decide what is best for your translation. (See: translate-transliterate)

for yourself 
“for you/yourself {and your family}” (See: figs-explicit)

out of gopher wood. 
”from gopher/cypress wood {which is good for building boats}.” or “out of the best wood {for building boats}.” It is not certain what kind of wood this was, so many translations transliterate (copy or borrow) the Hebrew word “gopher”. Some Bible scholars think it was cypress wood. (See: translate-unknown)

Make the ark {with} rooms,
“Build/Construct the ark/boat with compartments/stalls {inside},” or “Make/Build rooms inside the ark/boat,”

and cover it inside and outside 
“and {completely} seal/coat it inside and outside” 

with a covering.
“with pitch/tar {to keep water out}.” or “with pitch/tar {to keep the boat from leaking}.” The Hebrew word “covering” is general and does not specify what kind of waterproofing material is being used. However, many translations are more specific than that here and refer to “pitch” or “tar” or some other material made from tree resin or sap that can seal a boat well and keep it from leaking. 


Gen 6:15 And this {is} how you must make it: the length of the ark {must be} 300 cubits, its width 50 cubits, and its height 30 cubits. 

And this {is} how you must make it:
“Build the ark/boat with these dimensions/measurements:” or “You must make/build the ark/boat like this:”

the length of the ark {must be} 300 cubits, its width 50 cubits, and its height 30 cubits.
“It {must be} 140 meters long, 23/twenty-three meters wide, and 14/fourteen meters high.” or “It {must be} 450 feet long, 75/seventy-five feet wide, and 45/forty-five feet high.” A cubit was about half a meter (18 inches) long, which was the distance from a man’s elbow to the tip of his middle finger. You can (1) translate cubits into meters or feet, and put the literal text in a footnote; or (2) keep “cubits” in the main text (so that the numbers 300, 50 and 30 are kept) and put what that equals in meters or feet in a footnote. (See: translate-bdistance)


Gen 6:16 Make a window for the ark and finish it to within one cubit from the top. And put the door of the ark in its side. Make a lower, a second, and a third {deck}. 

Make a window for the ark and finish it to within one cubit from the top.
“Make/Build a window/skylight for the ark/boat by finishing {the sides/walls of} the ark/boat to within one cubit below the top/roof {of the ark/boat}.” or “Make/Build a half-meter high window/opening between the top of the walls/sides of the ark and its roof {all the way around}, {to let light and air in}.” The meaning of the Hebrew text is not completely certain here, but God was probably telling Noah to make a one-cubit high window or opening at the top of the outside walls of the ark, just below the roof, all the way around the ark, to let light and air into the ark. See the note about “cubit” in verse 15. (See: translate-bdistance)

And put the door of the ark in its side.
“Also put/build a door in the side of the ark/boat.” or “Put/Build a door for the ark/boat in its side.” Some translations begin this sentence without a conjunction (“And” or “Also”). Do what is natural in your language. (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)

Make a lower, a second, and a third {deck}.
“Make/Build a lower {deck/level}, a middle {deck/level}, and an upper {deck/level} {on the inside}.” or “{and} make/build a lower, second/middle, and third/upper story/floor {on the inside}.” or “{and} make/build three {complete} levels/floors {on the inside}.” Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin a new sentence here.


Gen 6:17 And behold me, I am bringing floodwaters on the earth to destroy all flesh that {has} the breath of life in it from under the heavens. Everything that {is} on the earth will expire! 

And behold me,
“Behold me,” or “Listen {carefully} to me,”

I am bringing floodwaters on the earth
“I am going to bring/send a flood on/over the {whole/entire} earth” or “I {myself} am going to flood the {whole/entire} earth {with water}”. In the Hebrew text, the pronoun “I” is emphatic, both by its form and by its position at the beginning of the sentence. If it is clear and natural in your language, keep that emphasis in your translation of this clause. (See: figs-pronouns)

to destroy
“{in order} to destroy” or “which will destroy”. See how you translated “destroy” in verse 13.

all flesh
“all the creatures/beings” or “every creature” or “every living thing”. This phrase is general here and includes people and animals, so you may need to translate the phrase differently here from what you did earlier in verses 12-13 (where the focus seems to be on people).

that {has} the breath of life in it
“that breathe/breathes {air}”. See how you translated this phrase in Gen 1:30.

from under the heavens. 
“from under the sky.” It may be clearer to put this phrase earlier in this sentence and say, “to destroy every living thing under the heavens/sky that has the breath of life in it.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

Everything that {is} on the earth
“{As a result,} every {living} thing/being that {is/lives} on land“ 

will expire! 
“will breathe out {its last breath}!” or “will die/perish!” The verb “expire” (which could also be translated “exhale” or “breathe out”) is used here as an idiom that means “die”. Consider whether your language has a similar or different idiom that would work well here. (See: figs-idiom)


Gen 6:18 But I will establish my covenant with you, so you must go into the ark, you and your sons and your wife and the wives of your sons with you.

But I will establish
“But/However I will make/institute” or “But/However I will set up”. The word “establish” means to deliberately and formally put something into effect. (See: grammar-connect-logic-contrast)

my covenant with you,
“a covenant between me and you,” or “a {special/peace} agreement between me and you,” This covenant is made up of the unconditional, unbreakable promises that God made to Noah (and all mankind and all other living things) in Genesis 8:2-9:17. The word “testament” is another word for “covenant,” so the way you translate “covenant” here could be similar to the way you translate the titles “Old Testament” and “New Testament.” (See: translate-key-terms)

so you must go into the ark,
“so you must enter the ark/boat,” or “so you must get on board the ark/boat,”
 
you and your sons and your wife and the wives of your sons with you.
“and {take} your sons, your wife, and your sons’ wives with you.” or “and {take} with you your wife, your sons, and their wives.”


Gen 6:19 And from every living {creature}, from all flesh, you must bring two from each {kind} into the ark to keep alive with you. They must be male and female. 

And from every living {creature}, from all flesh, you must bring two from each {kind} into the ark
“Also, from every {kind of} living creature, {yes,} from every {kind of} animal, you must bring/take two/pairs of each {kind} into the ark/boat” or “You must also bring/take into the ark/boat two/pairs of every {kind of} living creature, including every {kind of} animal,”

to keep alive with you.
“{in order} to keep {them} alive with you.” or “so that they stay alive with you.”

They must be male and female.
“They must be male and female {pairs}.” or “Each pair must have/include a/one male and a/one female.” or “Make sure that there are male and female {pairs} {of each kind}.”


Gen 6:20 From the birds according to their kinds, and from the animals according to their kinds, from every moving creature of the ground according to its kind, two from every {kind} will come to you to keep alive.

From the birds according to their kinds,
“{Males and females} from/of every kind of bird,” 

and from the animals according to their kinds,
“and from/of {every} kind of animal,”

from every moving creature of the ground according to its kind,
“including every kind of creature that moves/lives on the ground/land,” This phrase emphasizes that the birds and animals mentioned in the first half of this verse lived on land.

two from every {kind} will come to you 
“two/pairs of every kind {of animal} will come to you” or “two/pairs of each kind {of animal} will come to you”. For some languages it is more natural to change the order of clauses in this sentence and say, “Two/Pairs of every kind of bird and every kind of animal, including every kind of creature that moves on the ground, will come to you” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

to keep alive.
“to keep {them} alive {on/in the ark/boat}.” or “{into the ark} so that they stay alive.” or “so that you keep them alive {in the ark/boat}.”


Gen 6:21 And you must take with you some of every food that is eaten and store it with you, and it will be food for you and for them.” 

And you
“You” or “You {and your family}”. Although the pronoun “you” is singular in the Hebrew text in verse 21, it could be translated as plural, since God’s instructions apply to Noah and his family, not just Noah. Or you could make his family explicit. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-yousingular)

must take
“must {also} {gather and} take/bring” or “must {also} gather”

every food 
“every {kind of} food” or “all the different kinds of food”

 that is eaten 
“that people and animals eat” or “that you and {all} the animals/creatures will need”

and store it with you, 
“and store/stockpile/put it {on the ark/boat} with you,”

and it will be food 
“This/That will be the food supply” or “so that there will be {enough} food”. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin a new sentence here.

for you 
“for you {and your family}”. Consider again how you translated the pronoun “you” in this verse. (See: figs-yousingular)

and for them.”
“and for {all} the animals.” (See: writing-pronouns)
 

Gen 6:22 And Noah did {that}; according to all that God had commanded him, so he did.

And Noah did {that};
“So, {that is what} Noah did;” or “Noah did {all of that}”. Some translations begin verse 22 without a conjunction. Do what is best in your language.

according to all that God had commanded him, so he did.
“he did everything just/exactly as God had commanded/told him {to do}.”
