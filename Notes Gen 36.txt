36:1-19 Esau’s Descendants
1 Chronicles 1:34-54

Gen 36:1 And these {are} the generations of Esau, who {is} Edom.

And these {are} the generations of Esau,
“Now this is the genealogy/family-line of Esau,” or “These/Here are the descendants of Esau,” or “Here {is} the/a record/history about the descendants/family of Esau,” See how you translated “the generations of” in 25:12, 19. 

who {is} Edom.
“that {is}, Edom.” or “whose {nickname} was Edom.” or “who {was also called} Edom.” The name Edom means “red” and is the nickname that Esau got for trading his birthright to Jacob for some reddish-colored stew (Genesis~25:29-34). The region of Edom and the Edomites were named after Esau, which is probably why this chapter repeatedly mentions that Esau is Edom. (See: figs-explicit)
   

Gen 36:2 Esau had taken his wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah, the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah {and} the {grand}daughter of Zibeon the Hivite,

Esau had taken his wives from the daughters of Canaan: 
“Esau had chosen {two of his} wives from {among} the Canaanite women” or “Esau had married {two} Canaanite women” or “Esau had married {two} women who were descendants of Canaan”. Only the first two wives mentioned in this chapter were Canaanites; see the comment about Basemath at verse 3. The Canaanites were the descendants of Noah’s grandson Canaan (Ham’s son) and included the Hittites and Hivites (verse 2; Genesis 10:15-18) and several other people groups. You could put some of that information in a footnote. (See: figs-explicit)

Adah, 
“{including} Adah,” or “{Their names were} Adah,” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

the daughter of Elon the Hittite,
“{who was} the daughter of a Hittite named Elon,” or “whose father was Elon, {who was} a descendant of Heth,” or “the daughter of Elon, {who was} a member of the Heth/Hittite people {group},” Make sure your translation does not sound like Elon was the only Hittite. See how you translated “Hittites” in Gen 27:46. (See: translate-names)

and Oholibamah, 
“and {also} Oholibamah,” Notice that the names of Esau’s two Canaanite wives here are different from the names of his wives mentioned in Gen 26:34. It could be that they each had two names, or these may be different wives that he married later.

the daughter of Anah {and} the {grand}daughter of
“{who was} Anah’s daughter {and} the {grand}daughter of” or “whose father was Anah and whose grandfather was”. Notice that “Anah” and “Zibeon” are the names of men here, not women. (See: translate-names)

Zibeon the Hivite,
“a Hivite named Zibeon.” or “Zibeon {who was} a descendant of Hivi.” or “Zibeon {who was} a {member of the} Hivi/Hivite people {group}.” Make sure that your translation does not sound like Zibeon was the only Hivite. Consider again how you translated “Hivites” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 10:17; 34:2; 36:2. (See: translate-names)


Gen 36:3 and Basemath, the daughter of Ishmael {and} the sister of Nebaioth.

and Basemath, 
“{Esau also married} Basemath,” Since this Basemath was a daughter of Ishmael (who was a descendant of Noah’s son Shem), she was not a Canaanite, in contrast to Esau’s first two wives (verse 2). She was also known as Mahalath (Gen 28:9); you could include some of that information in a footnote. Be consistent here with how you spelled Basemath (a different woman with the same name) in Gen 26:34.

the daughter of Ishmael {and} the sister of Nebaioth.
“{who was} Ishmael’s daughter {and} Nebaioth’s {younger} sister.” or “whose father was Ishmael and whose {older} brother was Nebaioth.” Since Nebaioth was Ishmael’s oldest child (Gen 25:13), Basemath (Mahalath) was his younger sister, probably from the same mother. Use a kinship term here in your language that fits with those facts. See how you translated “the sister of Nebaioth” in Gen 28:9. (See: translate-kinship)

Gen 36:4 And Adah bore Eliphaz for Esau, and Basemath bore Reuel, 

And Adah bore Eliphaz for Esau, 
“{Esau’s wife} Adah bore/had {a son} for/with him {named} Eliphaz,” or “Adah had {a son} for/with Esau {whom they named} Eliphaz,”

and Basemath bore Reuel,
“and/while {his wife} Basemath bore/had {a son named} Reuel,” or “{His/Esau’s wife} Basemath had {a son they named} Reuel,” Consider whether or not it is best in your language to break this long sentence into two or more shorter sentences.


Gen 36:5 and Oholibamah bore Jeush and Jalam and Korah. Those {were} the sons of Esau who were born for him in the land of Canaan.

and Oholibamah bore 
“and {his/Esau’s wife} Oholibamah bore/had” or “Oholibamah had”

Jeush and Jalam and Korah.
“{sons named} Jeush, Jalam, and Korah.” or “{sons whom they named} Jeush, Jalam, and Korah.”

Those {were} the sons of Esau who were born for him in the land of Canaan.
“Those {were} Esau’s sons that his wives bore/had for/with him {while he and his family were living} in the land/region of Canaan.” or “{All} those {were} Esau’s sons whom he and his wives had {while they lived} in the land/region of Canaan.”

Gen 36:6 Then Esau took his wives and his sons and his daughters and all the people of his house, and his livestock and all his animal{s} and all his possession{s} that he had acquired in the land of Canaan, and he went to a land from the presence of Jacob his brother,

Then Esau took his wives and his sons and his daughters 
“Later Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters,”

and all the people of his house,
“and all the {other} members of his household,” This phrase refers to other relatives (besides Esau’s wife and children), as well as servants or slaves who lived with him.

and his livestock and all his animal{s} and all his possession{s} 
“as well as his livestock and all {the rest of} his animals and all the {other} possessions/belongings”

that he had acquired in the land of Canaan, 
“that he had gotten/accumulated {while they lived} in the land/region of Canaan,” See how you translated “acquired” and “land of Canaan” in Gen 12:5 and 31:18.

and he went to a land from the presence of Jacob his brother,
“and he moved to an area/region {that was} away from his brother Jacob.” or “and he moved/traveled to a {different} region {and settled there,} away from where his brother Jacob was living.” For some languages it is more natural to put this clause at the beginning of this verse and say, “Then/Later Esau moved to a land {that was} away from his brother Jacob. He took {with him} his wives....” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 36:7 because their possession{s} were {too} great for them to remain together, and the land of their sojournings was not able to support them because of their livestock.

because 
“{He/Esau did that} because” or “The reason {he/Esau moved away} is that”

their possession{s} were {too} great for them to
“he and Jacob {both} owned so many possessions/livestock that they could no longer” or “they {both} owned so many livestock/animals that they could not”. The phrase “their possessions” is general, but here it refers primarily to livestock. Make sure your translation of this phrase refers to both Esau and Jacob’s livestock, not just Esau’s. (See: figs-synecdoche)

remain together, 
“live together {in the same area/region}.” or “live near each other.”

and the land of their sojournings 
“The land where they were staying/living”. See how you translated Gen 13:6, which is similar in content to this verse.

was not able to support them because of their livestock.
“was {just} not big enough to support/feed them {all} because they owned/had so many livestock/animals.” or “did not have enough grazing areas {or water} to support/feed all the livestock/animals that both families owned/had.” For some languages it is necessary to switch the order of verses 6 and 7, and say, “After a while, Esau and Jacob had so many animals and other possessions that the land was not able to support both their families. So Esau took his wives...” If you do this in your translation, you should label these verses as “6-7”. (See: translate-versebridge)


Gen 36:8 So Esau settled in the mountains of Seir. Esau, who {is} Edom.

So Esau 
“That is why/how Esau {and his family}” or “That is the reason Esau {took his family and}” 

settled in the mountains of Seir.
“moved to the hill-country in {the land/region of} Seir.” or “went to live in the Seir Mountains.” or “ended up living in the Seir Mountains.” Esau had already been living in the region of Seir (Genesis 32:3, 33:16). Here he moves to the part of that region that had mountains. To make that clear, you could put that information in a footnote.

Esau,
“{That is the record/history about} Esau,”

who {is} Edom.
“that {is}, Edom” or “who {was also known as} Edom.” or “who {was also called} Edom.” Some translations put this phrase earlier in this verse and say, “So Esau, that is Edom, moved {with his family} to the mountains of Seir {and settled there}.” Do what is best in your language.

Now these {are} the generations of Esau, 
“What follows {is} {more of} the history of Esau,” or “This/Here {is} a {more detailed} genealogy/record of/about the descendants of Esau,” Consider again how you translated “generations” in the book of Genesis when it is followed by a genealogy (list of names). See Gen 5:1, 10:1, 11:10, 25:12, 36:9. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.

“Eliphaz {also} had a servant wife {named} Timna, and she had {a son} with him {named} Amalek.” or “Eliphaz and his servant wife Timna had {a son they named} Amalek.” See how you translated “concubine” in Gen 22:24, 25:6; 35:22.

“These {are} {the names of} the kings” or “This/Here {is} {a record/history about} the kings”. See how you translated “kings” in Gen 17:6 and 35:11. Be sure to distinguish “kings” (verses 31-39) from “chiefs” (verses 15-19, 21, 28, 40-43) in your translation of this chapter.

who reigned in the land of Edom 
“who reigned/ruled over {the people of/in} the land/region of Edom”

before a king reigned for the sons of Israel. 
“before there were any kings reigning/ruling over the descendants/people of Israel.” or “before the Israelites had their own king.” or “during the time {period} when the Israelites did not yet have their own king.” See how you translated “the sons of Israel” in Gen 32:3.


Gen 36:32 And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom, and the name of his city {was} Dinhabah.

And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom, 
“Bela, {who was} the son of Beor, was the {first} king to rule over {the people of} {the land/region of} Edom.” or “The {first} king to rule/reign over {the people of} {the land/region of} Edom was Bela, the son of Beor.” (See: figs-infostructure)

and the name of his city {was} Dinhabah.
“The name of his hometown {that he ruled from} {was} Dinhabah.” or “His {capital} city {that he ruled from} {was} Dinhabah.” Dinhabah was probably King Bela’s hometown, which he ruled the land of Edom from as his capital city.
 

Gen 36:33 Then Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah from Bozrah reigned in his place.

Then Bela died, and 
“When {King} Bela died,”

Jobab the son of Zerah from Bozrah reigned in his place. 
“Jobab, {who was} the son of Zerah from {the city of} Bozrah}, took his/Bela’s place as king.” or “Jobab, {who was} the son of Zerah, replaced/succeeded him/Bela as king {and ruled} from {his hometown of} Bozrah.” The phrase “from Bozrah” probably means this was Jobab’s hometown which he ruled from, much like the meaning of “his city” in verses 32, 35 and 39. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 36:34 Then Jobab died, and Husham from the land of the Temanites reigned in his place.

Then Jobab died, and
“When {King} Jobab died,”

Husham from the land of the Temanites reigned in his place.
“Husham, {who was} from the land/region of the Teman/Temanite people {group}, took his/Jobab’s place as king.” or “Husham replaced/succeeded him/Jobab as king {and reigned/ruled} from {his hometown which was in} the land/region where the Temanites lived.” King Husham may have been a descendant of Esau’s grandson Teman (verse 11). You could put that information in a footnote. Also compare how you translated verse 33. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 36:35 Then Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad reigned in his place, who struck the Midianites in the field of Moab. And the name of his city {was} Avith.

Then Husham died, and 
“When {King} Husham died, 

Hadad the son of Bedad
“Hadad, {who was} the son of Bedad,”

reigned in his place, 
“took his/Husham’s place as king.” or “replaced/succeeded him/Husham as king.” 

who struck the Midianites 
“{King Hadad is the one} who defeated the Midianites {in battle/war}”. See how you translated the idiom “struck” in Gen 14:5, 7. (See: figs-idiom)

in the field of Moab. 
“in a field {in the region/land} of Moab.” or “in the region/land/country of Moab.” Moab was a large region located to the east of the Dead Sea. This battle probably took place in the countryside or an unpopulated area (a “field”) within this region.

And the name of his city {was} Avith.
“The name of his/Hadad’s hometown {that he ruled from} {was} Avith.” or “His {capital} city {that he ruled from} {was} Avith.” See how you translated a similar sentence in verse 32.


Gen 36:36 Then Hadad died, and Samlah from Masrekah reigned in his place.

Then Hadad died, and
“When {King} Hadad died,

Samlah from Masrekah reigned in his place. 
“Samlah, {who was} from {the city of} Masrekah, took his/Hadad’s place as king,” or “Samlah replaced/succeeded him/Hadad as king {and ruled} from {his hometown of} Masrekah.” (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 36:37 Then Samlah died, and Shaul from Rehoboth {on} the river reigned in his place. 

Then Samlah died, and
“When {King} Samlah died,” 

Shaul from Rehoboth {on} the river reigned in his place.
“Shaul {who was} from {the city of} Rehoboth {on/beside} the River {Euphrates} took his/Samlah’s place as king.” or “Shaul replaced/succeeded him/Samlah as king {and ruled} from {his hometown of} Rehoboth, which was {beside} the {Euphrates} River.” See how you translated similar sentences in verses 33, 34 and 36. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 36:38 Then Shaul died, and Baal-Hanan the son of Acbor reigned in his place.

Then Shaul died, and Baal-Hanan the son of Acbor 
“When {King} Shaul died, Baal-Hanan, {who was} the son of Acbor,” 

reigned in his place.
“took his place as king.” or “replaced/succeeded him as king.” 


Gen 36:39 Then Baal-Hanan the son of Acbor died, and Hadar reigned in his place, and the name of his city {was} Pau. And the name of his wife {was} Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred {and} the granddaughter of Me-Zahab.

Then Baal-Hanan the son of Acbor died, and Hadar 
“When {King} Baal-Hanan died, Hadar”. Most translations follow the Hebrew text and have “Hadar” here. Some translations (and ancient versions such as SP, LXX, Syriac and Vulgate) have “Hadad” here instead, in order to spell this name the same way it is spelled in 1 Chronicles 1:50-51. However, that could cause confusion because “Hadad” is also the name of a different king in verses 35-36 above. (See: translate-names)

reigned in his place, 
“took his place as king” or “replaced/succeeded him as king”. Consider again how you translated this phrase in verses 33-39.

and the name of his city {was} Pau. 
“and the name of his hometown {that he ruled from} {was} Pau.” or “His {capital} city {that he ruled from} {was} Pau.” Consider whether it is best in your language to begin a new sentence here. Also see how you translated a similar clause in verses 32 and 35.

And the name of his wife {was} Mehetabel, 
“His wife’s name {was} Mehetabel,”

the daughter of Matred {and} the granddaughter of Me-Zahab.
“{who was} the daughter of Matred {and} the granddaughter of Me-Zahab.” or “whose father was Matred {and} whose grandfather was Me-Zahab.” Notice that “Matred” and “Me-Zahab” are the names of men. See how you translated similar phrases in verses 2 and 14. (See: translate-names)

____________________Paragraph Break_______________________

Gen 36:40 And these {are} the names of the chiefs of Esau, according to their clans, according to their places, by their names: Chief Timna, Chief Alvan, Chief Jetheth,

And these {are} the names of the chiefs of Esau,
“These/Here {are} the names of {more of} the chiefs {who descended} from Esau;” The chiefs listed below are different from those listed in the verses above, except for Kenaz and Teman (verse 15). (See: figs-explicit)

according to their clans, according to their places, by their names: 
“the names of their clans and the regions where they lived were named after them:” or “{the chiefs led} their own family groups in their own regions/territories, which were named after them:” or “{each chief led} his own family group and ruled his own region/territory that was named after him:”

Chief Timna, Chief Alvan, Chief Jetheth,
“Timna, Alvan, Jetheth,” The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. (1) Most translations treat all the names in verses 40-43 as the names of chiefs (as in the ULT and UST of these verses). (2) However, some scholars think that all the names in verses 40-43 are the names of regions or clans. Alternate translation of verses 40-43: “{These were} {the names of} the clans/tribes {that descended} from Esau. Each clan/tribe lived {in the land of Edom} in its own region that was named after that clan/tribe. {The names of the clans/tribes} were TImna, Alvan,...Iram. Those were {the names of} the clans/tribes of the Edomites. Each of the clans/tribes lived in their own part of the land {of Edom} that they owned...”


Gen 36:41 Chief Oholibamah, Chief Elah, Chief Pinon,

Chief Oholibamah, Chief Elah, Chief Pinon,
“Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon,” Make sure that the way you translate verses 41-43 fits with the interpretation you followed in verse 40.


Gen 36:42 Chief Kenaz, Chief Teman, Chief Mibzar, 

Chief Kenaz, Chief Teman, Chief Mibzar, 
“Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar,” 


Gen 36:43 Chief Magdiel, Chief Iram. Those {were} the chiefs of Edom, according to their dwellings in the land of their possession. That {was} Esau, the father of the Edomites.

Chief Magdiel, Chief Iram. 
“Magdiel, {and} Iram.” Make sure you are consistent in whether or not you use the title “Chief” in verses 40-43.

Those {were} the chiefs 
“Those {were} {the names of} {more of} the chiefs” or “{All of} those {were} chiefs” or “Those {were} {more of} the clan leaders”. Consider again how you translated “chiefs” throughout this chapter; see verses 15-19, 21, 28, 40-43.

of Edom,
“over/for the Edomites;” or “for/over the Edom people {group};”

according to their dwellings 
“they {all} led their own settlements” or “each of them led/ruled {their own clans} in the places where they lived”

in the land of their possession. 
“in the land/regions that they owned/controlled/inhabited.”

That {was} Esau, 
“That {was} {the record/history about} Esau,” or “This {concludes the record/history about} Esau,”

the father of the Edomites.
“{who was} the ancestor of {all} the Edomites.” or “{who was} the ancestor of the Edom people {group}.” See how you translated this phrase in verse 9. Also compare how you translated the names of other people groups in this chapter, including “Hittite” and “Hivite” in verse 2; “Edomites” in verse 9; “Horite/Horites” in verses 20, 21, 29, 30; “Temanites” in verse 34; and “Midianites” in verse 35.
