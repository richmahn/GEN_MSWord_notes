45:1-28 Joseph Reveals His Identity To His Brothers

Gen 45:1 Then Joseph was not able to control himself before all who were standing by him, and he called out, “Have every man leave from before me!” So no man stood with him when Joseph revealed himself to his brothers. 

Then Joseph
“When Joseph {heard that, he}” or “When Joseph {heard what Judah said, he}”

was not able to
“was no {longer} able to” or “could no {longer}”

control himself
“control/hide his emotions/feelings” or “keep himself from crying”

before all who were standing by him, 
“in front of all his servants who were with/attending him,” or “in front of all his attendants/servants,” Make sure that your translation of this phrase refers to Joseph’s servants, not his brothers.

and he called out, 
“and/so he shouted {to them},” or “and/so he said loudly {to them},”

“Have every man leave 
“All of you, leave” 

from beside me!”
“my presence!” or “the room!”

So no man stood with him when Joseph revealed himself to his brothers. 
“So Joseph was alone with his brothers when he made himself known to them.” or “{Immediately the/his servants/attendants left the room,} so that no one else was with him when he told his brothers who he was.” Make sure your use of nouns or pronouns to refer to Joseph and his brothers here is clear and natural in your language. (See: writing-pronouns)


Gen 45:2 And he gave his voice in crying, and the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard. 

And he gave his voice in crying, and
“Then he raised his voice and cried loudly/uncontrollably, so that” or “But he started crying so loudly that”. Consider whether your language has an idiom such as “gave his voice in crying”. Also see how you translated “cried” in Gen 42:24; 43:30. (See: figs-idiom)

the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard.
“{many} Egyptians heard {him/it}, including {the members of} Pharaoh’s household/family.” or “the Egyptian {servants} heard {him/it}, and so did Pharaoh’s household/family.” The word “house” refers here to Pharaoh’s family members and servants, not a literal building. (See: figs-metonymy)


Gen 45:3 Then Joseph said to his brothers, “I {am} Joseph! Is my father still alive?” But his brothers were not able to answer him, because they were terrified at his presence.

Then Joseph said to his brothers, 
“Then Joseph/he exclaimed to his brothers {in their language},” In this chapter, “brothers” refers to Joseph’s older brothers (from different mothers) and his younger brother (from the same mother). (See: translate-kinship)

“I {am} Joseph! 
“I {am} {your brother} Joseph!” or “I {am} Joseph, {your brother}!”

Is my father still alive?”
“Is our father still alive?” Joseph uses “my father” to emphasize his relationship with his father. Make sure your translation does not sound like he had a different father than his brothers.

But his brothers were not able to answer him, 
“But his/Joseph’s brothers could not reply/respond to him,” or “His brothers could not say a word,”

because they were terrified at his presence.
“because they were terrified/shocked {to realize} that they were in his presence.” or “because they felt very afraid to be standing in front of him.” For some languages it is necessary to put this clause earlier in this sentence and say, “But his brothers were so terrified to see him that they could not answer him.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

Gen 45:4 Then Joseph said to his brothers, “Please come close to me.” So they came close, and he said, “I {am} Joseph your brother, whom you sold into Egypt. 

Then Joseph said to his brothers, 
“So Joseph said to them,”

“Please come close to me.” 
“Please come near/closer to me.” or “Please come here next to me.”

So they came close, and he said, 
“After/When they went closer {to him}, he said {to them},” or “After they did that, he said {to them},”

“I {am} Joseph your brother,
“I {really/truly am} your brother Joseph,”

whom you sold into Egypt.
“whom you sold {to be a slave} in {the country of} Egypt.” or “whom you sold {as a slave that was brought/taken here} to Egypt.” Joseph’s brothers sold him to slave traders who were going to Egypt. If necessary, you could make some of that information explicit in your translation. (See: figs-explicit)


Gen 45:5 And now, do not be grieved and do not let it burn in your eyes that you sold me here, because God sent me ahead of you for the preservation of life. 

And now, 
“But now,” or “But”

do not be grieved 
“do not be upset/distressed”

and do not let it burn in your eyes 
“or/and angry with/at yourselves”. Consider again how you translated various idioms for “anger” or “be angry” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 4:5-6; 30:2; 31:35-36; 34:7; 44:18; 45:5. It may be necessary to translate these idioms in different ways, depending on the context. (See: figs-idiom)

that you sold me here, 
“that you sold me {and caused me to be a slave} here,” or “for selling me {as a slave},” 

because God sent me 
“because God sent me {here}” or “because {it was actually} God {who} sent me {here}” 

ahead of you
“before you came,” or “before you got here,”

for the preservation of life.
 “to save {many people’s} lives.” or “to keep many people from dying.” (See: figs-abstractnouns)


Gen 45:6 For this {is} two years the famine {has been} in the midst of the land, and {there are} still five years {in} which {there will} not be plowing and harvesting. 

For this {is} two years 
“For two years {now}” or “The past two years”

the famine {has been} in the midst of the land,
“{there has been} a famine throughout this country/region,” or “a famine {has been affecting/devastating} this whole region,” See how you translated “famine” in Gen 12:10.

and {there are} still five years {in} which 
“and for another five years {it will be so severe/bad that}” or “and during the next five years {it will be even worse, so that}” or “and there will be five more years when”

{there will} not be plowing and harvesting. 
“{there will} be no plowing {of fields} or harvesting {of crops}.” or “no one will {be able to} plant {seeds} or harvest {crops}.”


Gen 45:7 But God sent me ahead of you to preserve a remnant for you on the earth, and to keep you alive by a great deliverance.

But God sent me 
“That is why God sent me {here}” or “God sent me {here}” or “God caused me to come {here}”

ahead of you 
“before you came,” or “before you got here,”

to preserve a remnant for you 
“so that you will have descendants survive/living” or “to help you survive and have descendants” 

on the earth,
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) “on the earth” (2) “in the/this land”

and to keep you alive 
“by helping you stay live” or “by saving your lives”

by a great deliverance. 
“through this/his amazing/extraordinary rescue.” or “in this amazing/powerful way.” For some languages it is better to put the last two phrases earlier in this sentence and say, “But God sent me ahead of you to save your lives in this amazing way so that you will survive and have descendants on the earth.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 45:8 So now, {it was} not you {who} sent me here, but God. And he has made me father to Pharaoh, and lord over all his house and the ruler in all the land of Egypt.

So now, 
“So then,” or “So”

{it was} not you 
“you are/were not {the ones}”

{who} sent me here,
“{who} caused me to come here,” 

but God. 
“rather {it was} God {who sent/brought me}.” or “rather, God {is/was the one} {who did it/that}.”

And he has made me father to Pharaoh, 
“He has {also/even} made me {like a} father to Pharaoh,” Joseph was like a father to Pharaoh in that Pharaoh highly honored him and Joseph took care of Pharaoh’s household and all their needs. (See: figs-metaphor)

and lord over 
“so that I am the master/supervisor of” or “so that I am the one in charge of”. See how you translated “lord” in Gen 42:30, 33.

all his house
“his entire household”. See how you translated “house” in Gen 41:40. (See: figs-metonymy)

and the ruler 
“and {also} the governor” or “and {also} the highest official”

in all the land of Egypt.
“in/over the entire/whole country of Egypt.”

Gen 45:9 ”Hurry and go up to my father and say to him, ‘This {is what} your son Joseph says, “God has made me lord over all Egypt. Come down to me, do not delay. 

“Hurry and go up 
“Hurry up/back” or “Leave quickly and go back” or “Return quickly”. In this verse, the words “up” and “down” reflect the fact that Canaan was higher in elevation than Egypt. Many languages leave those words implied. Do what is best in your language.

“to our father”. See how you translated “my father” in verse 3.

and say to him, ‘This {is what} your son Joseph says, 
“and tell him that his son Joseph has sent him this message:” Consider whether it is best in your language to translate this embedded quote as a direct or indirect quote. (See: figs-quotesinquotes)

“God has made me lord over all Egypt. 
“God has made/appointed me ruler/governor over the entire {country of} Egypt.” Consider whether it is best in your language to translate this doubly embedded quote (which continues through verse 11) as a direct or indirect quote. An example of an indirect quote would be: “God has made him the ruler over all Egypt. He urges you to come down there to live near him, without delay. He also says that you and your family may live in Goshen Province and that way you will live near him....He will provide for you there...” (See: figs-quotesinquotes)

Come down to me, 
“{So} {please} come down {here} {to live} near me,”

do not delay. 
“{and} do not delay/wait.” or “{and} do not take very long to come.” For some languages it is more natural to put this clause first in this sentence and say, “{So} {please} do not take very long, but rather come down/here quickly {to live} near me.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 45:10 And you will live in the land of Goshen so that you will be near to me—you, and your children and your children’s children, and your flocks and your herds and all that {belongs} to you. 

And you will live 
“You {and your family} can/may live”. The pronouns “you” and “your” in this verse are singular, but Joseph’s message to his father includes the whole family. (See: figs-explicit)

in the land of Goshen
“in the region/territory of Goshen” or “in Goshen Province/County”. Goshen was a region or territory that was part of the country of Egypt. Make sure your translation of “land” does not sound like Goshen was its own country.

Gen 45:11 And I will provide for you there, because {there are} still five years of famine, so that you will not become impoverished, you and your household and all that {belongs} to you.” ’

And I will provide for you there, 
“I will take care of you there,” or “I will support you there,” 

because {there are} still five years of famine, 
“since {there are} still five {more} years of famine {ahead/coming}.” or “because the famine will last five {more} years.” For some languages it is more natural to put this clause first in this verse and say, “There are still five more years of famine ahead/coming, so I will provide for you there {in Goshen}.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

“{Please come} so that” or “That way”

“you and your {extended} family will not become impoverished/destitute/poor {and die}.” or “{the famine} will/does not cause you and your family to lose everything you own {and die}.” The verb “become impoverished” can include losing livestock, other belongings, and the lives of their servants and family members.

“And behold,
“And/Now look/listen!” or “{Then Joseph said to his brothers,} Look!” Make sure it is clear in your translation that Joseph’s message to his father was completed in verse 11, and that here in verse 12 he is talking directly to his brothers again.

your eyes 
“{I can tell that} {all of} you,” or “{All of} you,” The word “eyes” is used figuratively here (and in the next phrase) to refer to the persons themselves; it also emphasizes the fact that they were seeing Joseph in person. Consider what is the best way to translate this phrase in your language. (See: figs-synecdoche)

and cried, 
“and cried {for joy},” or “and started crying {because he was so happy}.”

Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated “{shekels} of silver” at Genesis 20:16 (and see the note there). Three hundred shekels of silver was equal to about 3.5 kilos (7.5 pounds). (See: figs-infostructure)

But his heart went numb, 
“{When their father heard that news,} he was stunned {and silent},” or “{When Jacob heard that,} he was completely shocked,” This idiom means that Jacob was so shocked that he did not know which way to go with his emotions or what to think, say or do; it does not mean that he died.
