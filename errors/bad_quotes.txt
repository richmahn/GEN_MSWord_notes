WARNING at GEN 3:5: note still has straight quote marks: '“you will be like God/him because you will know {what is} good/right and {what is} evil/wrong.” or “you will know {what is} good/right and {what is} evil/wrong just like God does.” The Hebrew word “Elohim” in this clause is ambiguous. It can mean (1) “God”, as it does everywhere else in the first 30 chapters of Genesis; (2) “gods” or “divine beings"; (3) “angels”. See how you translated “good and evil” in Gen 2:9, 17.'

WARNING at GEN 3:11: note still has straight quote marks: '“that I commanded you, `Do not eat from it'?” For some languages it is more natural to use a direct quote here for Yahweh’s words. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])'

WARNING at GEN 3:20: note still has straight quote marks: '“Eve, {which means “living/live,"}” If you include the meaning of Eve’s name in your translation or in a footnote, make sure it is similar to the word in the following clause that has the same meaning (“living”), so that it is clear why Eve was given that name. The meaning of names is important in the Hebrew language, and this translation issue occurs frequently in the book of Genesis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])'

WARNING at GEN 4:1: note still has straight quote marks: '“{a son they named} Cain{, which means “obtained/acquired"}.” You could include the meaning of Cain’s name in your translation or in a footnote. See what you did for a similar case in Gen 3:20.'

WARNING at GEN 4:16: note still has straight quote marks: '“in the land/region of/called Nod, {which means “wandering,"}” or “in Nod Land,” The original readers of the Hebrew text knew that the name “Nod” means “wandering”. Usually translators transliterate (copy or borrow) the name from the Hebrew text, and they might also include the meaning of the name in the text or in a footnote. If you do that here, the meaning should be similar to how you translated “wanderer” in verses 12 and 14. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])'

WARNING at GEN 25:6: note still has straight quote marks: '“"he sent them eastward to the land/region in the East” or “he sent them to the east country” or “he made them move away to the east country”.

WARNING at GEN 27:45: note still has straight quote marks: '“and he forgets what you did to him” or “and he no longer thinks about what you did” or “and he doesn't hold a grudge against you anymore”.

The interpretation that is not followed in your translation could be put in a footnote.'

WARNING at GEN 29:17: note still has straight quote marks: '“Leah’s eyes {were} delicate/pretty/weak,” or “Leah had pretty eyes,” The Hebrew word for “delicate” is ambiguous in this context. It can have: 1) a positive meaning of “pretty” or “lovely"; or 2) a negative meaning of “weak”, which implies that Leah’s eyes were plain, dull or unattractive.'

WARNING at GEN 29:32: note still has straight quote marks: '“She named him Reuben, {which means “Look/See, a son!"}” You could include the meaning of Reuben’s name in your translation (or in a footnote), so that people understand why Leah gave him that name.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])'

WARNING at GEN 30:24: note still has straight quote marks: '“{because} she said,” For some languages it is more natural to put the last half of verse 24 first in the verse and say, “She also said, “May Yahweh add/give another son to me.” So she named that/her son Joseph, {which means “may he add/give another."}” Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])'

WARNING at GEN 31:15: note still has straight quote marks: '“Doesn't he regard/treat us” or “It is obvious that he regards/treats us” or “He obviously is treating us”. This rhetorical question expects the answer “yes” and expresses Rachel and Leah’s anger at how their father treats them. Consider whether or not it is natural in your language to use a rhetorical question here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])'

WARNING at GEN 31:27: note still has straight quote marks: '“without telling me {you were leaving}?” or “{Why} didn't you tell me {that you were leaving}?” or “You should have told me {you were leaving}”. Verse 27 is one long rhetorical question in the Hebrew text that expresses Laban’s anger at Jacob. For some languages, it is better to break it up into two or more sentences. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])'

WARNING at GEN 31:28: note still has straight quote marks: '“You did not {even} let me kiss my daughters and my grandchildren {goodbye} {before they left}!” or “{You left so secretly that} I wasn't even able to say goodbye to my daughters and grandchildren!” For some languages, it may be more natural to mention the daughters before the children. Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated “kiss” in Gen 27:26-27, and see the note about that at 27:26. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])'

WARNING at GEN 31:42: note still has straight quote marks: '“If God, the Revered/Awesome One, whom my father Isaac and {grandfather} Abraham serve/worship” or “If God whom my ancestors Abraham and Isaac serve/worship and fear/revere”. The phrase “the Fear of Isaac” is a title for God that is ambiguous in Hebrew (and English). It could mean: 1) “the One/God whom Isaac fears/reveres"; or 2) “Isaac’s God whom {people/others} are afraid/terrified of”. The interpretation that is not used in your translation could be put in a footnote. Make sure it is clear in your translation that Jacob is only talking about one God in this verse, not two or three. Also notice that “my father” and “Isaac” both refer to Jacob’s father Isaac, not two different people.'

WARNING at GEN 31:43: note still has straight quote marks: '“But/Yet there is nothing I can do today/now” or “But I can't do anything now”. Laban uses this rhetorical question to express his emotions and emphasize that there is nothing that he can do. Consider whether or not a rhetorical question fits well here in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])'

WARNING at GEN 31:47: note still has straight quote marks: '“Jegar Sahadutha {which means “witness heap/pile/mound"},” or “Jegar Sahadutha {which means “heap/pile that reminds"},” If the meaning of “Jegar Sahadutha” and “Galeed” is included in your translation or in a footnote, be sure that it fits with how you translate “heap/pile/mound” in verses 46 and 48, and “witness” in verse 48. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])'

WARNING at GEN 31:48: note still has straight quote marks: '“they/people call it Galeed.” or “that place is called Galeed.” or “the name of that place is Galeed.” The phrase “he called its name” is used here as an idiom that is very general and means “they/people call it"; it does not refer to Laban. Make sure that is clear in your language. See how you translated this idiom in Gen 11:9.'

WARNING at GEN 31:49: note still has straight quote marks: '“{It is/was} also {called/named} Mizpah,” or “People also call {the place,} Mizpah,” or “{Another name for the place is} Mizpah, {which means “watchtower,"}”'

WARNING at GEN 32:2: note still has straight quote marks: '“So he named that place Mahanaim, {which means “two camps/armies."}” If you include the meaning of the name “Mahanaim” in your translation or in a footnote, be sure it matches the way you translated “God’s camp” earlier in the verse, so that it is clear why Jacob gave the place that name. Also see how you translated “he called the name of that place” in Gen 28:19. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])'

WARNING at GEN 32:11: note still has straight quote marks: '“Please rescue me {now}” or “{I'm asking you now to} please save/rescue me”'

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])'

WARNING at GEN 32:30: note still has straight quote marks: '“So/Then Jacob named the/that place Peniel, {which means “face of God,"}”'

WARNING at GEN 33:10: note still has straight quote marks: '“No, I beg you.” or “Please don't refuse {my gift}.” In verses 10 and 11, Jacob speaks urgently to Esau, because in that culture if Esau accepts Jacob’s gift, he is committing himself to treat Jacob as a friend.'

WARNING at GEN 33:17: note still has straight quote marks: '“the name of that place/town is {called} Succoth, {which means “shelters."}” or “they/people call that place/town Succoth, {which means “shelters."}” The phrase “he called” could refer to Jacob, or it could refer to people in general, as in Gen 11:9; 16:14; 21:31; 25:30; 27:36; 29:34; 31:48. If you include the meaning of the name Succoth in your translation or in a footnote, make sure it matches the way you translate “shelters” earlier in this verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])'

WARNING at GEN 33:20: note still has straight quote marks: '“and he named it El Elohe Israel, {which means “God is the God of Israel."}” The name “El Elohe Israel” could also mean “Powerful/Mighty is the God of Israel” because the Hebrew word “el” can mean “God” or “powerful”. You could put that information in a footnote. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])'

WARNING at GEN 34:1: note still has straight quote marks: '“went {to/into the city} to visit {with}”. The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. The verb “to see": 1. could be used here as an idiom that means “to visit"; many languages have a similar idiom; or 2. could literally mean that Dinah went “to see/observe” the local women, for example, how they dressed and what jewelry they wore. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])'

WARNING at GEN 34:5: note still has straight quote marks: '“so he didn't say anything {about it}” or “so he didn't tell anyone {about it}”. Make sure your translation of this phrase does not mean that Jacob was totally silent. Rather, it means he did not speak about what Shechem had done to Dinah.'

WARNING at GEN 34:30: note still has straight quote marks: '“I/We {only} have a few men {to defend us},” or “I/We don't have many people {in our family/household},” The words “I”, “me” and “my” refer in this verse to all of Jacob’s family; he uses these pronouns because he is the leader of his family. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])'

WARNING at GEN 34:31: note still has straight quote marks: '“He/Shechem should not have treated our sister” or “We couldn't let him/Shechem {just} get away with treating our sister”. This rhetorical question shows Simeon and Levi’s anger and emphasizes that Shechem was wrong to do what he did and implies that he (and his city) deserved justice. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])'

WARNING at GEN 35:7: note still has straight quote marks: '“El Bethel, {which means “the God of/at Bethel,"}” or “El Bethel, {which means “the God of/at God’s house,"}” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])'

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])'

WARNING at GEN 35:15: note still has straight quote marks: '“Then Jacob called/named that place Bethel, {which means “house of God,"} because God had spoken/talked to him there.” or “Since God had spoken/talked to Jacob at that place, Jacob named it Bethel, {which means “God’s house."}” See how you translated “called the name of that place Bethel” in Gen 28:19.'

WARNING at GEN 35:18: note still has straight quote marks: '“she named her baby {boy} Benoni, {which means “son of my sorrow/trouble."}” The meaning of this name could imply that the child caused Rachel’s death. In the Hebrew text this name is two words connected with a dash (“Ben-oni”). Many translations write it that way, or as one word (“Benoni”), and a few translations write it as “Ben Oni”. Any of these spellings is fine. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])'

WARNING at GEN 35:18: note still has straight quote marks: '“named him Benjamin {instead}.” or “changed his name to Benjamin, {which means “son of my right hand."}” The phrase “son of my right hand” is an idiom that means “favored son” or “son of strength”. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])'
