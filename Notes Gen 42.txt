42:1-38 Joseph’s Brothers Come To Egypt To Buy Grain

Gen 42:1 Then Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, so Jacob said to his sons, “Why are you looking at each other?”

Then 
“Meanwhile {in the land/region of Canaan},” This verse begins a new episode which overlaps in time with some of what was happening in chapter 41. Consider what is the best way to begin this episode in your language. (See: writing-newevent)

Jacob saw that there was grain in Egypt, so
“when Jacob heard/learned that there was grain {for sale} in {the country of} Egypt,” or “when Jacob found out that {he/they could buy} grain in Egypt,”

Jacob said to his sons,
“he asked/told his sons,”

“Why are you looking at each other?”
“What are you waiting for?” or “Do not {just stand/sit here} looking/staring at each other!” or “Do not just {stand around/there} doing nothing!” Jacob uses this rhetorical question to get his sons to take action and do what he says next. Consider the best way to communicate that in your language. (See: figs-rquestion)


Gen 42:2 And he said, “Behold, I have heard that there is grain in Egypt. Go down there and buy {some} for us from there so that we will live and not die.”

And he said, 
“Then he continued/added,” For some languages it is more natural to omit the quote margin here, because the same person (Jacob) is still talking to the same people (his sons). Do what is best in your language. (See: writing-quotations)

“Behold, 
“Listen {to this}!” or “Look,”

I have heard 
“I heard/learned” or “Someone told me”
   
that there is grain in Egypt.
“that there is {much} grain {for sale} in {the country of} Egypt.” or “that {the country of} Egypt has {a lot of} grain {that people can buy}.”

Go down there 
“{So} {I want/need you to} go/travel there” or “{So} {please} go/travel down there”. Make sure that the way you translate Jacob’s command to his sons does not sound rude or harsh. (See: figs-politeness)

and buy {some} for us from there 
“and buy {some} {grain} for us {all}” or “and buy {some} for us {and our families} {to eat}”

so that we will live 
“so that we will/can survive” or “so that we will/can stay alive”

and not die.”
“and not die {from hunger}.” or “and not starve to death.”


Gen 42:3 Then ten of Joseph’s brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.

Then ten of Joseph’s brothers 
“Then/So Joseph’s ten {older} brothers”. These ten brothers were older than Joseph and had different mothers than he did. (See: translate-kinship)

went down to buy grain from Egypt. 
“{left home/Canaan and} went/traveled down to Egypt to buy {some} grain {there}.” The verb “went down” refers to the fact that Egypt was lower in elevation than the land of Canaan. It is also located southwest of Canaan. See how you translated “go down” in verse 2 and “went down” in Gen 12:10.


Gen 42:4 But Jacob did not send Benjamin, the brother of Joseph, with his brothers, because he said, “So that harm does not meet him!”

But Jacob did not send Benjamin, the brother of Joseph, 
“But Jacob did not send Joseph’s {younger} brother Benjamin {to Egypt}” or “But Jacob did not allow/permit Joseph’s {younger} brother to go {to Egypt}”. Benjamin was younger than Joseph and had the same mother (Rachel) and father. (See: translate-kinship)

with his brothers, 
“with his {other} brothers,” or “with {the rest of} his brothers,”

because he said, “So that harm does not meet him!”
“because he/Jacob thought that he/Benjamin might be harmed.” or “because he/Jacob was afraid/concerned that something bad/terrible might happen to him.” For some languages it is more natural to put this clause first in this verse and say, “But Jacob was concerned that harm might come to Joseph’s {younger} brother Benjamin, so he did not send him with {the rest of} his brothers {to Egypt}.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-quotations)

Gen 42:5 And the sons of Israel came among {those} who came to buy {grain}, because the famine was in the land of Canaan. 

And the sons of Israel 
“So Israel’s sons” or “The sons of Israel {that is, Jacob}” or “So the sons of {Jacob who was also called} Israel”. If it is not clear that “Israel” (verse 5) and “Jacob” (verse 4) refer to the same person, you could include the name Jacob here in your translation or in a footnote. (See: figs-explicit)

came 
“came/went {to Egypt}” or “arrived {in Egypt}” (See: figs-go)

among {those} who came
“along with {many} other people who were coming/going {there}” or “along with {many} other travelers”

“was {also} {affecting everyone} in the land/region of Canaan.” or “was {also} affecting/devastating the {entire} land/region of Canaan.” 


Gen 42:6 Now Joseph {was} the governor over the land. {It was} he who was selling {grain} to all the people of the land. So the brothers of Joseph came and bowed down to him {with} {their} noses to the ground. 

Now Joseph {was} the governor over the land. 
“{Since} Joseph {was} the administrator over the land/country {of Egypt},” (See: writing-background)

{It was} he who was selling {grain} 
“he {was} the one selling {grain}”

to all the people of
“to people {who came to him} from all over”

the land.
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean {1) “the country {of Egypt}” as it does earlier in verse 6; or it can mean (2) “the earth/world.”

So the brothers of Joseph 
“So/Then Joseph’s brothers”

came and bowed down to him {with} {their} noses to the ground.
“{also} came/went before him {like everyone else} and bowed down {with} {their} faces/foreheads to/toward the ground {to show him respect}.” or “{also} came/went {to him} and prostrated themselves before him {to show respect}.” See how you translated “bow down” in Gen 37:7, 9-10. (See: translate-symaction)


Gen 42:7 And Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he acted like a stranger to them, and he spoke with them harshly and said to them, “Where did you come from?” And they said, “From the land of Canaan to buy food.”

And Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them,
“When Joseph saw his brothers, he recognized them” or “Joseph immediately recognized his brothers”

but he acted like a stranger to them, 
“but he treated them like strangers” or “But he pretended that/like he did not {know} {them}”. For some languages it is better to divide the first sentence in this verse into shorter sentences. Do what is best in your language.

and he spoke with them harshly 
“and spoke to them in a harsh/stern way/manner” or “In fact, he spoke to them sternly/roughly”. Consider whether or not it is more natural to begin a new sentence here in your language. 

and said to them,
“and asked/questioned them,” or “and demanded,”

“Where did you come from?”
“Where are you from?” or “What country are you from?”

And they said, 
“They answered {him},” (See: writing-quotations)

“From the land of Canaan 
“{Sir,} {we came/are} from the land/region of Canaan”. For some languages it is necessary to begin with a respectful title or form of address when someone talks to a person of high status like Joseph. See how Joseph’s brothers address him in verse 10. (See: figs-honorifics)

“to buy {some} grain.”


Gen 42:8 And Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him. 

And Joseph recognized his brothers, but 
“Although Joseph recognized his brothers,”

they did not recognize him.
“they did not realize/know who he was.”

Gen 42:10 But they said to him, “No, my lord, but your servants have come to buy food. 

But they said to him, 
“But his brothers replied to him,”

“No, my lord,
“No, sir,” or “Sir, we are not {spies},” Make sure your translation of this phrase sounds polite. In some cultures it is rude to say “No” too directly. See how you translated a similar phrase in Gen 23:11. (See: writing-politeness)

but your servants have come
“rather {we} come {before you} respectfully/humbly” or “rather {we are} {just} humble men {who} have come {here}”. The brothers referred to themselves as “your servants” to show respect to Joseph and to acknowledge his high position. Translate this phrase in a polite way that shows respect toward Joseph. (See: figs-123person)

“{only} to buy {some} food/grain.”

“but the {other} one” or “but {our other} brother”

is not {alive}.”
“is no more.” or “is no longer {with us}.” or “has died.” In this context, “is not” is an idiom that means “has died.” Consider whether or not your language has a similar idiom that would fit well here. (See: figs-euphemism)

{By} the life of Pharaoh, 
“{I swear/vow} by Pharaoh’s life/authority {that}” or “As certain as Pharaoh lives, {I swear/vow that}”. Joseph uses Pharaoh’s name here to make an oath that emphasizes the certainty of what he says next. See how you translated other vows in Gen 14:22 and 21:23-24.

turned away from them
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “turned his back to them” (2) “went/stepped away from them”. Either way, Joseph was hiding his face from his brothers so they could not see that he was crying.

and cried.
“and wept.” or “to hide his tears.”

Then he 
“Then {after he recovered,} he/Joseph” or “{When he had composed himself,} he/Joseph”

turned back toward them 
“turned back around to face them” or “came back toward/to them”. Make sure that the way you translate this phrase fits with the way you translated the last sentence in verse 23.

“and spoke to them {again} {through/using his interpreter/translator}.” or “and continued speaking to them.” 

Then he took Simeon from them
“Then/Next he chose Simeon from {among} them” or “Then he separated Simeon from {the rest of} the/his brothers”. 

and bound him 
“and had him bound/imprisoned” or “and {had his soldiers} bind/confine him {with chains/ropes}”. Joseph probably had soldiers bind Simeon. See how you translated a similar case in Gen 40:3. (See: figs-explicit)

Gen 42:25 Then Joseph ordered {his servants} and they filled their bags {with} grain. And {he ordered them} to return {each} man’s silver to his sack, and to give provisions to them for the road. And he did that for them. 

Then Joseph ordered {his servants} and they filled
“Then Joseph commanded/told his servants to fill” or “Then Joseph had his servants fill”

their bags {with} grain. 
“his brothers’ bags/sacks {with} grain.” Two different words, “bag” and “sack”, are used in this verse to refer to the bags of grain that the brothers had. Some languages use just one of these terms in order to prevent confusion. Do what is best in your language. 

And {he ordered them} to return {each} man’s silver to his sack 
“{He} also {ordered/told them} to {secretly} put in each brother’s sack/bag the money {they had paid for the grain}” or “{He} also {ordered/told them} to {secretly} put the/his brothers’ {grain/food} money in their sacks/bags”. Joseph had his servants to do this without his brothers knowing about it. (See: figs-explicit)

and to give provisions to them for the road.
“and to provide/supply them {with} food to eat on the/their trip/journey {home}.” or “and to give them food to eat as they traveled {home}.”

And he did that for them.
“So, that is what was done for them.” or “That is what Joseph did for them.” or “After Joseph did that for his brothers,” Consider whether it is more natural in your language to end this sentence here (and begin verse 26 with a new sentence), or to continue this sentence into verse 26.


Gen 42:26 Then they loaded their grain onto their donkeys and went from there.

Then they 
“Then his brothers” or “they” or “his brothers”. Make sure your choice here fits with the way you translated the end of verse 25.

loaded their grain onto their donkeys 
“loaded/put their {sacks of} grain on their donkeys’ {backs}”

and went from there.
“and left there {to go home}.” or “and started traveling {home}.” The way you translate this phrase should reflect the fact that Joseph’s brothers were just starting their journey back home; they did not reach their home until several days later (verse 29).

and each {man} trembled to his brother, saying, 
“and they all started trembling/shaking {with fear} and said/exclaimed to each other,” or “and they trembled/shook {with fear}. They asked each other,”

“The man, the lord of the land, 
“The man {who is} the ruler/governor over the land/country {of Egypt}” or “The man who governs/controls the land/country {of Egypt}”

spoke to us harshly 
“spoke to us sternly/roughly” or “was very harsh/stern when he spoke to us”. See how you translated “harshly” in verse 7.

and treated us as {if we were} 
“and accused us of” or “He even accused us of”

spying out the land!
“spying {on} {their} country!” or “being spies!”


Gen 42:31 But we said to him, ‘We {are} honest. We are not spies.

But we said to him, ‘We {are} honest. We are not spies.
“But we told him, ‘We {are} trustworthy {men}; not spies.” or “We told him that we are not spies, but rather honest/trustworthy {men}.” Consider whether it is more natural in your language to translate this embedded quote as a direct or indirect quote. Also, see how you translated “...honest...not spies” in verse 11. (See: figs-quotesinquotes)
 

Gen 42:32 We {are} twelve brothers, the sons of our father. The one is not {alive}, and the youngest {is} with our father today in the land of Canaan.’

We {are} twelve brothers, 
“There {were} twelve of us brothers,” or “{We told him that} we {are} twelve brothers,” Make sure that the way you translate verse 32 fits with whether you used a direct or indirect quote in verse 31. (See: figs-quotesinquotes)

the sons of our father.
“sons of one father.” or “{and} {we are} the sons of the same father.”

The one 
“One {of our brothers}”

“is no more,” or “is no longer {with us},” or “has died,” See how you translated this idiom in verse 13. (See: figs-euphemism)

and the youngest 
“and the/our youngest {brother/one}” 

{is} with our father today
“{is} {at home} with our father right now” or “{is} right now with our father {at home}”

in the land of Canaan.
“in the region of Canaan.”

Gen 42:33 “Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us, ‘By this I will know that you {are} honest: Leave one of your brothers with me, and take {grain} {for} the famine of your households and go.

“Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us, 
“Then the ruler/governor of the land/country said/replied to us,” or “But the man who governs/rules the land/country told us,” See how you translated “the man, the lord of the land” in verse 30.

‘By this 
“This is how” or “In this way”. See how you translated “By this” in verse 15.

I will know that you {are} honest:
“I will know that/if you {are} trustworthy {men/people}:”

Leave one of your brothers with me, 
“You must leave one of you here with me,” or “One of you brothers will/must stay {here} with me,”

and take {grain} {for} the famine of your households and go.
“while {the rest of} you take/buy {grain} {to relieve} the hunger of your families and go {home}.” or “and/while {the rest of} you go {home} with {grain/food for} your hungry/starving households/families.”


Gen 42:34 Then bring your youngest brother to me so that I will know that you {are} not spies, that you {are} honest. {Then} I will give your brother to you, and you {can} trade {in} the land.’ ”

Then bring your youngest brother to me 
“Then/But bring your youngest brother {back} {here} to me” or “After that, you must come back {here} to me with your youngest brother.” See how you translated a similar clause at the beginning of verse 20.

so that I will know that you {are} not spies, 
“Then I will know that you {are} not spies,” Consider again how you translated “spies” in Gen 42:9-11, 14, 16, 30, 31, 34.

that you {are} honest. 
“{but} {are} honest/trustworthy {men/people}.” For some languages it is more natural to change the order of clauses in this sentence and say, “Then I will know that you are honest/trustworthy {men/people} and not spies.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

{Then} I will give your brother to you, 
“{Then} I will return your brother to you {from prison},” or “{Then} I will release to you your brother {who is in prison},”

and you {can} trade {in} the land.’ ”
“and I will allow {all of} you to travel {and trade} throughout my country.’ ” or “and you can travel around my country {and trade} {freely}.’ ”

Gen 42:35 Then it happened they were emptying their sacks, and behold, each {man’s} pouch of his silver {was} inside his sack! And they and their father saw the pouches of their silver, and they were afraid.

Then it happened they were emptying their sacks, 
“Then Joseph’s brothers started/began to empty their {grain} sacks,” or “Sometime after that, the brothers began to empty {the grain} from their sacks,”

and behold, each {man’s} pouch of his silver {was} inside his sack! 
“and there inside each man’s sack was his pouch/bag of money {that he had paid for the grain}!” or “and they were surprised to find/see their pouches/bags of silver/money inside their sacks!”

And they and their father saw the pouches of their silver, and 
“When they and their father {Jacob} saw the pouches/bags of silver/money,”

they were afraid.
“they were terrified.”
 

Gen 42:36 Then Jacob their father said to them, “You have bereaved me! Joseph is not {here}! And Simeon is not {here}! And you will take Benjamin! All {these} things are against me!”

Then Jacob their father said to them, 
“Then their father said/exclaimed to them,” If you make “Jacob” explicit in verse 35, you could leave it implied here in verse 36.

“You have bereaved me! 
“You have bereaved/deprived me {of my sons}!” or “You have caused me {terrible} loss!”

Joseph is not {here}! And Simeon is not {here}! 
“Joseph is gone! Simeon is gone!” or “Joseph and Simeon are no longer {with us}!”

And you will take Benjamin! 
“And {now} you {want to} take Benjamin {away} {from me} {too}!”

All {these} things are against me!”
“Everything is against me!” or “Everything is going terribly/badly for me!”

Gen 42:37 Then Reuben said to his father, saying, “You may kill my two sons if I do not bring him to you. Put him in my hand, and I will return him to you.”

Then Reuben said to his father, saying,
“Then Reuben said/responded to his father,” or “Reuben replied,” (See: writing-quotations)

“You may kill my two sons if I do not bring him to you. 
“You may punish me by killing my sons if I do not bring Benjamin back to you.” or “If I fail to bring Benjamin/him {back} to you {safely}, you can {punish me by} killing my two sons.” For some languages, it is necessary to change the order of clauses in this sentence (so that the condition comes first), as in the second alternate above. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

Put him in my hand, 
“Entrust him/Benjamin to my care {as we travel to Egypt},” or “Let me be responsible for {taking care of} him/Benjamin {on our trip to Egypt},” The phrase “in my hand” is used here as an idiom that means that Reuben was going to be responsible for Benjamin’s welfare. (See: figs-idiom)

and I will return him to you.”
“and {I promise that} I will bring him back to you {safely}.” For some languages it is more natural to change the order of clauses in this quote and say, “{Father,} let me be responsible for {taking} Benjamin {down to Egypt}. If I fail to bring him {back} to you {safely}, you can {punish me by} killing my two sons.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 42:38 But he said, “My son will not go down with you, because his brother is dead and he alone is left. And {if} harm were to meet him on the road that you are going on, then you would bring my gray head down in sorrow to Sheol!”

But he said, 
“But his father replied/insisted,” (See: writing-quotations)

“My son will not go down with you,
“My son {Benjamin} will/may not go with you {to Egypt}” or “{No,} I will not let my son {Benjamin} go down {to Egypt} with you”. Notice that the pronoun “you” is plural in this verse. Also, see how you translated “go down” in verse 2.

because his brother is dead
“His brother is dead,” Joseph was Benjamin’s older brother from the same father and mother. Consider whether your language has a special kinship term for that. Also consider whether or not it is better to begin a new sentence here in your language. (See: translate-kinship)

and he alone is left.
“so he is the only one {of his mother’s sons} {who is} still alive.” or “and/so he is the only one/son {I have} left {from his mother}.” You could include a footnote here that explains that Joseph and Benjamin were the only two sons of Rachel, Jacob’s favorite wife who died after giving birth to Benjamin (Gen 35:16-20).

And {if} harm were to meet him on the road that you are going on,
“And/So if he were to be harmed/killed during your journey,” or “So if anything bad happened to him while you are traveling,” Jacob is saying what would happen if he lost Benjamin too. Consider how to best translate this hypothetical statement in your language. Also, see how you translated “harm...meet him” in verse 4. (See: figs-hypo)

then you would bring my gray head down in sorrow 
“you would cause me, your gray-haired/elderly father, to grieve so deeply/badly that I would {die and} go down” or “you would cause me, your gray-haired/elderly father, so much sorrow/grief that I would {die and} go down”. The phrase “my gray head” is a synecdoche which Jacob uses to refer to himself as their aged father. Consider whether your language has a similar phrase that is natural and works well here. (See: figs-synecdoche)

to Sheol!”
“to the afterworld!” The Hebrew term “Sheol” is the name of the place where the spirits of people went after they died. If you transliterate the name “Sheol” in your translation, you could put its meaning in a footnote. See how you translated this term in Gen 37:35, and see the note about that there. (See: translate-unknown)
