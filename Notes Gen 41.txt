41:1-36 Pharaoh’s Two Dreams

Gen 41:1 Then it happened {at} the end of two years of days, that Pharaoh was dreaming and behold, he was standing beside the River.

Then it happened {at} the end of two years of days, that
“After two full years had passed,” or “Two whole/complete years later,”

Pharaoh was dreaming and behold, he was standing
“{King} Pharaoh had a dream. {In the dream} he saw himself standing” or “{King} Pharaoh dreamed that he was standing”. See how you translated “Pharaoh” in Gen 40:2. (See: translate-names)

beside the River.
“beside the {Nile} River.” This phrase usually refers to the Nile River, which was the most important river in Egypt and was so well known by everyone that it was referred to as “the River”. See how you translated a different Hebrew word for “river” in Gen 36:37. (See: figs-explicit)


Gen 41:2 Then behold, from the River came up seven cows, fine-looking and fat-fleshed, and they grazed among the reeds.

Then behold,
“Then suddenly,” or “Then he saw that”

from the River came up seven cows, fine-looking and fat-fleshed,
“seven cows {that were} healthy-looking and fat/well-fed came/walked up out of the river {onto the bank/land}” or “seven healthy-looking, fat/well-fed cows came/walked up out of the river {onto the bank/land}”. Make sure your translation does not sound like the cows rose up out of the water into the air. Also see how you translated “cows” in Gen 32:15. 

and they grazed among
“and started grazing/eating” or “and started feeding on”

the reeds.
“the grass {that was there}.” or “the tall/marsh grass {beside the river}.”


Gen 41:3 Then behold, seven other cows came up after them from the River, ugly-looking and thin-fleshed, and they stood beside the {other} cows on the bank of the River.

Then behold, 
“Then suddenly,” or “Then/Next he saw that”

seven other cows came up after them from the River, ugly-looking and thin-fleshed,
“seven cows {that were} sickly-looking and scrawny/skinny walked up out of the river” or “seven sickly-looking, scrawny/skinny cows came/walked up out of the river” (See: figs-infostructure)

and they stood beside the {other} cows
“and stood next to the {first/healthy} cows” 

on the bank of the River.
“on the bank of the river.” or “on the river bank.” Consider again how you refer to “the River” in verses 1-3. If you refer to it as “the {Nile} River” in verse 1, it may be more natural to refer to it as “the river” after that. Do what is best in your language.


Gen 41:4 Then the ugly-looking and thin-fleshed cows ate the seven fine-looking and fat cows, and Pharaoh woke up.

Then the ugly-looking and thin-fleshed cows
“Then the sickly-looking, scrawny/skinny cows” or “Then the cows {that were} sickly-looking and scrawny/skinny”. See how you translated this phrase in verse 3.

ate
“ate/swallowed {up/down}” or “devoured”

the seven fine-looking and fat cows,
“the seven healthy-looking, fat/well-fed cows.” or “the seven cows {that were} healthy-looking and fat/well-fed.” See how you translated this phrase in verse 2.

and 
“{Just} then” or “After that,” or “At that point,”

Pharaoh woke up.
“{King} Pharaoh woke up.” or “the king woke up”. Consider the best way in your language to refer to Pharaoh at each point/occurrence in this chapter.

Gen 41:5 Then he fell asleep and dreamed a second {time}. And behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, fat and good. 

Then he 
“Then Pharaoh” or “Then the king”

fell asleep
“went to sleep {again}” or “went {back} to sleep”. (See: figs-idiom)

and dreamed a second {time}.
“and had a second {dream}.” or “and started dreaming again.” 

And behold,
“{This time} he saw” or “{In this dream} there were” 

seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, fat and good.
“seven big/plump, beautiful/well-formed heads of grain growing on the same stem/plant.” The phrase “heads of grain” is one word in the Hebrew text. Consider whether it is better in your language to use a word or phrase to translate this.
 

Gen 41:6 Then behold, seven heads of grain, thin and scorched {by} the east wind, sprouted after them. 

Then behold,
“Then suddenly,” or “Then/Next he saw {that}”

seven heads of grain, thin and scorched {by} the east wind
“seven small/shriveled heads of grain that were dried out {by} the {hot} east/desert wind” or “seven thin/shriveled heads of grain that the {hot} east/desert wind had dried out”. This wind was from the desert in the east, so it was hot and dry. (See: figs-explicit)

sprouted 
“grew/sprang up” or “started/were growing”

after them.
“next to them {on the same stalk/plant}.” or “{on the same stalk/plant} beside the first/well-formed heads.” Consider whether it is better in your language to refer to the first heads here with a pronoun (“them”) or a noun phrase. (See: writing-pronouns)


Gen 41:7 Then the thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven fat and full heads. Then Pharaoh woke up, and behold, {it was} a dream.

Then the thin heads of grain
“Next, the small/shriveled heads of grain”. See how you translated “thin” in verse 6 and “heads of grain” in verses 5-6.

swallowed up
“swallowed down” or “ate/gobbled up/down” or “devoured”. See how you translated a different Hebrew word that has a similar meaning (“ate {up/down}”) in verse 4.

the seven fat and full heads.
“the seven big/plump, well-formed heads.” The word “full” here describes heads of grain that have many seeds in them. See how you translated “fat” in verse 5.

Then Pharaoh woke up,
“{Just} then Pharaoh woke up” or “After that, Pharaoh woke up” or “At that point, Pharaoh woke up”. See how you translated this in verse 4.

and behold, {it was} a dream.
“and {suddenly} realized/knew that {he had been} dreaming.”

Gen 41:8 Then it happened in the morning that his spirit was agitated, so he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt and all its wise men. Then Pharaoh told his dreams to them, but no one could interpret them for Pharaoh.

Then it happened in the morning that
“In the morning” or “The next morning”. The phrase “Then it happened” introduces and emphasizes an important event. It also increases suspense so that the audience wonders what the outcome will be. Many English translations do not include this phrase, possibly for reasons of naturalness. Do what is natural in your language.

his spirit was agitated,
“his/Pharaoh’s spirit/mind was disturbed/troubled {about what the dreams might mean},” or “Pharaoh was/felt upset/distressed {about the/his dreams},”

so he sent and called for
“so he sent {servants/messengers} to summon” or “so he had {servants/messengers} summon”

all the magicians of Egypt and all its wise men.
“all the magicians/sorcerers and {other} wise men in {the country of} Egypt {to come to him}.” Magicians were some of the wise men whom Pharaoh regularly consulted for advice. They had power from demons to do miracles (Exodus 7:11, 22; 8:7) and to communicate with the spirits of people who had died. They may have also been astrologers, or Egyptian priests who were skilled in sacred writings. Some of that information could be put in a footnote.

Then Pharaoh told his dreams to them,
“{When they arrived,} Pharaoh/he told them what he had dreamed,” or “Then Pharaoh/he related/described to them what {he had seen} in his dreams,”

but no one
“but none of them” or “but none of those men”

could interpret them for Pharaoh.
“was able to explain to him {what} the dreams {meant}.” or “could tell him what the dreams meant.”


Gen 41:9 Then the chief of the cupbearers spoke with Pharaoh, saying, “Today I remember my offenses. 

Then the chief of the cupbearers
“Then/But the head wine-server”. Consider again how you translated “chief of the cupbearers” and “cupbearer” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 40:1-2, 5, 9, 13, 20-21, 23; 41:9.

spoke with Pharaoh, saying, 
“spoke {up} and said to Pharaoh,” or “said to Pharaoh,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Today I remember 
“{Sir,} today I remember” or “{Your Majesty/Honor,} I now remember”. For many languages, it is necessary to use a respectful title to address a person of high status like Pharaoh. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-honorifics)

my offenses.
“my sins/failures.” The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean (1) “{the time} when I offended/displeased/wronged {you}.” (2) “something {important} I failed/forgot to do.” The second interpretation refers to the cupbearer forgetting to tell Pharaoh about Joseph.


Gen 41:10 Pharaoh broke out in anger against his servants, and he put me in custody {in} the house of the chief of the guards, me and the chief of the bakers. 

Pharaoh broke out in anger against
“{Some time ago,} {King} Pharaoh, {you} were very angry at/with”. The events in verses 10-13 had happened two years earlier (verse 1); chapter 40 gives the details about those events. See how you translated the idiom “broke out in anger against” in Gen 40:2. (See: figs-explicit)

his servants, 
“his/your officials/officers,” In verses 10 and 13, the cupbearer uses third person (“Pharaoh....his....he...”) to show respect for Pharaoh. For some languages, it is confusing to do that, so second person (“you...your...you...”) must be used instead. Some languages have an honorific such as “your Majesty/Honor” that could be used occasionally in these verses instead of third person. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-123person)

and he put me in custody {in} the house of the chief of the guards, me and the chief of the bakers.
“{including} me and the chief/head baker, and he/you put us in custody/prison at the captain of the guards’ house.” or “and he/you put the head baker and me in the prison that is in the house of the captain of the guards.” See how you translated “put...in custody in the house of the chief of the guards” in Gen 40:3. Also consider again how you translated “chief of the bakers” and “baker” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 40:1-2, 4-5, 16-17, 20, 22; 41:10, 13.


Gen 41:11 And we dreamed a dream in the same night, he and I; each of us dreamed according to the interpretation of his dream. 

And we dreamed a dream in the same night, he and I;
“{One time while we were there,} we {each} dreamed/had a dream in/during the same night,” or “{While we were there,} one night we {each} had a dream,” See how you translated a similar sentence in Gen 40:5. In verses 11-13, the pronouns “we” and “us” exclude Pharaoh. (See: figs-exclusive)

each of us dreamed according to the interpretation of his dream.
“{and} each of our dreams had a different meaning.” or “{and} each of our dreams had its own meaning.” Consider again how you translated “interpretation” in Gen 40:5, 8, 12, 18; 41:11 and the related verb “interpret” in Gen 40:16, 22.


Gen 41:12 Now there with us {was} a young Hebrew man, a servant for the chief of the guards. And we told {our dreams} to him, and he interpreted our dreams for us; he interpreted {for} each according to his dream. 

Now there with us {was} a young Hebrew man,
“There was a young Hebrew man with us”. Translate “young...man” in a way that fits with the fact that Joseph was 30 years old (verse 46) and was not yet married.

a servant for the chief of the guards.
“{who was} a servant for the captain of/over the guards.” Consider again how you translated “chief of the guards” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 37:36; 39:1; 40:3-4; 41:10, 12.

And we told {our dreams} to him, and
“After we told him {our dreams},” or “After we related/described {our dreams} to him,” Consider again how you translated “told” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 24:66; 29:13; 37:9-10; 40:8-9; 41:8, 12.

he interpreted our dreams for us;
“he explained them to us.” or “he told us what they meant.”

he interpreted {for} each according to his dream.
“He interpreted each man’s dream.” or “He told each of us the meaning of our dreams.” or “He told us what each of our dreams meant.” 


Gen 41:13 And it happened, just as he interpreted for us, so it happened: me he restored to my position, and him he hanged.”

And it happened, just as he interpreted for us, so it happened:
“And sure enough, everything happened exactly the way he had interpreted/explained {the dreams} to us:”

me he restored to my position,
“you reinstated/reappointed/returned me to my {former/previous} position/work {as your cupbearer/wine-server},” See how you translated “restored to...position” in Gen 40:21.

and him he hanged.”
“and/but you {had your soldiers execute} the baker {and} hang/impale his body {on a pole/stake}.” or “but you {had your soldiers} execute the baker.” Consider again whether you referred to Pharaoh in third person (“he”) or second person (“you”) in verses 10 and 13. Also see how you translated “hanged/impaled {on a tree/pole}” in Gen 40:22. (See: figs-123person)

Gen 41:14 Then Pharaoh sent and called for Joseph. So they quickly brought him from the pit. Then he shaved and changed his clothes and came to Pharaoh. 

Then Pharaoh 
“{Immediately} Pharaoh” or “{When Pharaoh heard that,} {immediately} he”

sent and called for Joseph.
“sent {servants/messengers} to summon/get Joseph.” or “had {servants/messengers} summon Joseph.” See how you translated “sent and called for” in verse 8.

So they quickly 
“So they hurriedly” or “So they went right away and”

brought him from the pit.
“brought/got him/Joseph out of the dungeon/prison.” See how you translated “pit” in Gen 40:15.

Then he shaved and changed his clothes and
“Then he shaved {his head and face}, changed into suitable/better clothes and” or “Then after he shaved {his head and face} and changed into appropriate/clean clothing, he”. Since Joseph lived in Egypt and Egyptian men kept their heads and faces clean-shaven, Joseph probably also shaved his head and his face. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to make this implied information explicit in your translation. (See: figs-explicit)

came to Pharaoh.
“came/went before Pharaoh.” or “came/went into Pharaoh’s presence.” Your choice of “came” versus “went” in this context depends on whose perspective you take: “came” reflects things from Pharaoh’s point of view, and “went” reflects things from Joseph’s point of view. Do what is most natural in your language. (See: figs-go)


Gen 41:15 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I dreamed a dream, but no one could interpret it. But I heard about you, saying {that} you hear a dream {and are able} to interpret it.” 

Then Pharaoh said to Joseph,
“Then Pharaoh said to him,” or “Then Pharaoh told Joseph/him,” (See: writing-quotations)

“I dreamed a dream,
“I had a dream,” 

but no one could interpret it.
“but no one has been able to explain {to me} what it means.” or “but there isn’t anyone who can interpret/explain it {for/to me}.” See how you translated a similar clause in Gen 40:8.

But I heard about you, saying {that}
“But someone told me about you, that” or “But I was told that”

you hear a dream {and are able} to interpret it.”
“when you hear a dream, {you are able} to interpret/explain what it means.” or “when someone tells you a dream, {you are able} to interpret/explain its meaning.” Consider again how you translated “interpret” and “interpreter” throughout the book of Genesis. See Gen 40:8, 16, 22; 41:8, 12, 13, 15, 16.


Gen 41:16 And Joseph responded to Pharaoh, saying, “{It is} not in me; God will answer with Pharaoh’s peace.”

And Joseph responded to Pharaoh, saying,
“Joseph replied to Pharaoh/him,” (See: writing-quotations)

“{It is} not in me;
“{Sir,} I do not have that ability {on my own},” or “{Your Majesty,} I cannot do that {by myself},” Make sure your translation of Joseph’s response sounds polite. See what you did in verse 9. (See: figs-honorifics)

God will answer
“{but/rather} God will explain/interpret {your dream}” 

with Pharaoh’s peace.”
“for your well-being/good, {King} Pharaoh.” or “so that {you,} {King} Pharaoh, will have peace {in your heart/spirit}.” Consider whether or not it is more natural in your language to use Pharaoh’s name at the beginning of this quote (instead of here) and say, “{King} Pharaoh, I do not have that ability...” (See: figs-infostructure)

Gen 41:17 Then Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, “In my dream, behold, I was standing on the bank of the River.

Then Pharaoh spoke to Joseph,
“So Pharaoh told Joseph/him,” (See: writing-quotations)

“In my dream, behold, I was standing
“As I was dreaming, I saw myself standing” or “I dreamed that I was standing”

on the bank of the River.
“on the bank of the {Nile} River.” or “beside the {Nile} River.” See how you translated “the {Nile} River” in verse 1. Since this is the first time that Pharaoh mentions “the River” to Joseph, consider whether this is a good place in your translation to make it explicit again that this is the Nile River. (See: figs-explicit)


Gen 41:18 Then behold, from the River came up seven cows, fat-fleshed and of fine form, and they grazed among the reeds. 

Then behold,
“Then suddenly,” or “Then I saw that”. Compare how you translated verse 2, which is similar, but not identical, to verse 18.

from the River came up seven cows, fat-fleshed and of fine form,
“seven cows {that were} fat and healthy-looking came/walked up out of the river {onto the bank/land}” or “seven fat/well-fed, healthy-looking cows came/walked up out of the river {onto the bank/land}” (See: figs-infostructure)
 
and they grazed among
“and started grazing/eating” or “and started feeding on”

the reeds.
“the reeds/plants {that were there}.” or “the tall/marsh grass {beside the river}.”


Gen 41:19 Then behold, seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ugly of form and thin-fleshed. I have not seen {cows} as ugly as those in all the land of Egypt!

Then behold,
“Then suddenly,” or “Then/Next I saw that”. See how you translated verse 3, which is similar to the first half of verse 19.

seven other cows came up after them,
“seven other cows came/walked up {out of the river} behind the first cows;”

poor and very ugly of form and thin-fleshed.
“they were in terrible/horrible condition, very sickly-looking and scrawny/skinny.” For some languages it is more natural to put this information earlier in this sentence and say, “Then behold, seven poor/weak, very sickly-looking, scrawny cows came up {out of the river} behind the first cows/ones.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

I have not seen
“{In fact,} I have not/never seen” 

{cows} as ugly as those
“such awful-looking {cows}” or “{cows} in such poor/terrible/bad condition”

in all the land of Egypt!
“in the whole/entire country of Egypt!” or “anywhere in the country of Egypt!”


Gen 41:20 Then the thin and ugly cows ate the first seven fat cows.

Then the thin and ugly cows
“Then the scrawny/skinny, sickly/unhealthy cows” or “Then the cows {that were} scrawny/skinny and sickly/unhealthy”

ate 
“ate/swallowed {up/down}” or “devoured”. See how you translated “ate” in verse 4.

the first seven fat cows.
“the seven fat/well-fed cows.” See how you translated “fat” or “fat-fleshed” in verses 2, 4, 18 and 20.


Gen 41:21 So they went into their bellies, but it could not be known that they had gone into their bellies, and their appearance {was} just as ugly as at the beginning. Then I woke up.

So they went into their bellies, but
“But {even} after they had eaten/devoured them,” or “But although the scrawny/skinny cows had eaten/swallowed the fat/well-fed cows/ones,”

it could not be known 
“it could not be seen” or “no one would {ever} know”

that they had gone into their bellies,
“that they had eaten/devoured them,”

and their appearance {was} just as ugly as at the beginning.
“because they {still} looked just as ugly/terrible/scrawny as {they had} before.”

Then I woke up.
“That’s when I woke up.” or “At that point, I woke up.”

Gen 41:22 ”Then I saw in my dream, and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, full and good.

“Then I saw in my dream, and 
“Then I {fell asleep again and} continued dreaming. {This time}” or “Then I {went back to sleep and} had {another} dream. {In this dream}” 

behold,
“there were” or “I saw”

seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, full and good.
“seven heads of grain growing on a single stalk/plant. They were full of ripe grain kernels.” or “seven full/big, beautiful/well-formed heads of grain growing on the same stalk/plant.” See how you translated verse 5, which is similar to verse 22. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 41:23 Then behold, seven heads of grain, withered, thin {and} scorched by the east wind sprouted after them.

Then behold, 
“Then suddenly,” or “Then/Next I saw {that}”. See how you translated verse 6, which is similar to verse 23.

seven heads of grain, withered, thin {and} scorched by the east wind
“seven heads of grain {that were} small and withered/wilted because they were dried out by the {hot} east/desert wind” or “seven small, withered/wilted heads of grain that the {hot} east/desert wind had dried out”

sprouted 
“grew/sprang up” or “started/were growing”

after them.
“next to them {on the same stalk/plant}.” or “{on the same stalk/plant} beside the first/well-formed heads/ones.” For some languages it is more natural to change the order of phrases in this verse and say, “Then seven small heads of grain sprouted {on the same plant} next to the first heads/ones. {These had} withered/wilted because the {hot} east/desert wind had dried them out.” Do what is best in your language.

Gen 41:25 Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “Pharaoh’s dreams {are} one. What God is doing he has shown to Pharaoh.

Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, 
“Then Joseph told Pharaoh,” or “Then Joseph responded to Pharaoh,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Pharaoh’s dreams {are} one. 
“{Both} Pharaoh’s/your dreams have the same meaning.” or “Your Majesty/Honor, {both of} your dreams mean the same thing.” In verses 25, 28, 32-35, Joseph uses third person (“Pharaoh....his....he...”) to show respect for Pharaoh. For some languages, it is confusing to do that, so second person (“you...your...you...”) must be used instead. Some languages have an honorific such as “your Majesty/Honor” that could be used occasionally in these verses instead of third person. Do what is best in your language. Also see what you did in verses 10 and 13. (See: figs-123person)

What God is doing he has shown to Pharaoh.
“{Through them,} God is revealing/showing to you what he will do.” or “God has revealed to {you,} {King} Pharaoh, what he is planning/about to do.” The Hebrew text emphasizes “what God is doing” by putting that phrase first in the sentence. Consider what is the most natural phrase order for this sentence in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 41:26 The seven good cows {are} seven years, and the seven good heads of grain {are} seven years. The dreams {are} one.

The seven good cows {are} seven years, 
“The seven healthy cows {in your dream} {represent/symbolize} seven years,”

and the seven good heads of grain {are} seven years. 
“and the seven beautiful/well-formed heads of grain {represent/symbolize} {the same} seven years.”

The dreams {are} one. 
“{Both} dreams mean the same thing.” or “{Both} dreams have the same meaning.” See how you translated “dreams {are} one” in verse 25.


Gen 41:27 And the seven thin and ugly cows that came up after them {are} seven years, and {so are} the seven thin heads of grain scorched by the east wind. There will be seven years of famine.

And the seven thin and ugly cows 
“The seven scrawny/skinny and sickly/unhealthy cows”. See how you translated “thin and ugly cows” in verse 20, and how you translated “thin” in verse 19.

{are} seven years, and {so are}
“{represent/symbolize} {a different} seven years, and {so do}”

the seven thin heads of grain 
“the seven small heads of grain”. See how you translated “thin” in verses 6 and 23, and consider again how you translated “heads of grain” in verses 5-7, 22-24, 26-27.

scorched by the east wind.
“that the {hot/dry} east/desert wind had dried out/up.” or “that the {desert} wind from the east had dried out/up.” See how you translated this phrase in verses 6 and 23. Also consider again how you translated “east” in the book of Genesis; see Gen 2:8; 3:24; 10:30; 11:2; 12:8; 13:11; 14; 25:6; 28:14; 29:1, 41:6, 23, 27. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.

There will be seven years of famine.
“{They both mean that} there will be a famine that lasts seven years.” or “{Both dreams mean that} there will be seven years when food will be very/extremely scarce.” A “famine” is a prolonged period of time when people are starving because crops are failing, often due to a lack of rain or other severe weather conditions. See how you translated this term in Gen 12:10 and 26:1.


Gen 41:28 That {is} the word that I have spoken to Pharaoh: what God is doing he has shown to Pharaoh.

That {is} the word that I have spoken to Pharaoh: 
“{King} Pharaoh, that {is} what I was talking about when I told you that” or “Your Majesty/Honor, as I told you previously,” Consider what is the best way to refer to Pharaoh here in your language. See what you did in verse 25. (See: figs-honorifics) 

what God is doing he has shown to Pharaoh.
“God is showing/revealing to you what he will do.” or “God has shown/revealed to you what he is going/about to do.” See how you translated this clause in verse 25. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 41:29 Behold, seven years are coming {of} great abundance in all the land of Egypt.

Behold, seven years are coming
“Listen, {first} there will be seven years”

{of} great abundance 
“when crops/harvests are abundant” or “when people will have more than enough food {to eat}” or “when everyone will have plenty of food {to eat}”

in all the land of Egypt.
“throughout the entire/whole land/country of Egypt.”


Gen 41:30 But seven years of famine will rise up after them, so that all the abundance in the land of Egypt will be forgotten, and the famine will consume the land.

But seven years of famine will rise up after them,

“So people/everyone in the country of Egypt will forget how good it was during the time/years when they had plenty of food,” or “As a result, the people in Egypt will forget what it was like in their country during all the years when they had more than enough {food} {to eat},” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

“because the famine” or “because the severe food shortage” 

will consume the land. 
will devastate/destroy the land/country {and the people}.” or “will devastate/ravage the land/country {so that many people will starve}.” The phrase “the land” here probably also includes the people who lived in that country. (See: figs-metonymy)


Gen 41:31 And the abundance in the land will not be remembered because of that famine after it, because it {will be} very heavy.

And 
“That’s right,” or “Yes/Indeed,” Verse 31 restates much of the content of verse 30, so keep that it mind as you translate the beginning of this verse. (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)

the abundance in the land will not be remembered 
“people will completely forget about the time/years when food was plentiful,” or “there will be no evidence/trace left that there were years when there was more than enough food”

because of that famine after it, because it {will be} very heavy.
“because the famine {that comes/happens} after that {will be} very/so severe/oppressive.” or “because the following years when food is scarce {will be} so severe/terrible.” For some languages, it clearer and more natural to put this clause near the beginning of this verse and say, “Yes, the famine that is coming will be so severe/terrible that people will completely forget about the time/years when food was abundant/plentiful in the land.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 41:32 And as for the repeating of the dream to Pharaoh twice, {it is} because the matter has been established by God, and God will soon do it.

And as for the repeating of the dream to Pharaoh twice, {it is} because 
“The reason you dreamed/had the same dream in two different ways/forms is that” or “The fact that you, {King} Pharaoh, had two {different} dreams that mean the same thing shows that” (See: figs-123person)

the matter has been established by God, 
“God has {firmly} decided/determined what he is going to do,” or “God wants you to know that this will {definitely} happen,” 

and God will soon do it.
“and he will make it happen soon.” or “and he will cause it to happen {very} soon.”

And under Pharaoh’s hand, 
“Under Pharaoh’s/your direction,” or “Under/Using your authority, {King} Pharaoh,” Consider again how you translated the use of the third person to address Pharaoh respectfully in verses 10, 13, 25, 32-35. (See: figs-123person)

41:37-57 Joseph Is Appointed As The Governor Of Egypt And Stores Up Grain
 
Gen 41:37 And the word was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants.

And the word was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of all his servants.
“What Joseph said/proposed seemed like a good plan to Pharaoh and all his servants/officials.” or “Pharaoh and all his servants/officials agreed that what Joseph had said/proposed was good.” See how you translated the idiom “in the eyes of” in Gen 34:18. (See: figs-idiom)


Gen 41:38 Then Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find a man like this who {has} the Spirit of God in him?”

Then Pharaoh said to his servants, 
“So Pharaoh said to his officials,” or “So Pharaoh exclaimed to them,”

“Can we find a man like this
“{Certainly} we cannot find anyone else more qualified than this man,” or “{It is obvious that} we will never find a man as qualified as this/Joseph,” Pharaoh uses a rhetorical question here to emphasize that no one is more qualified than Joseph. Consider whether it is better in your language to translate this quote using a question or a statement. (See: figs-rquestion)

who {has} the Spirit of God in him?”
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean (1) “who has God’s Spirit in him” or “whom God’s Spirit guides” (2) “who has a divine spirit in him” or “who has a spirit of {the} gods in him”. Most translations follow the first interpretation, since Joseph had just talked to Pharaoh about God (verses 16, 28, 32) and Pharaoh acknowledges God in verse 39.
 

Gen 41:39 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has shown all this to you, {there is} no one {as} discerning and wise as you.

Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, 
“Then he said to Joseph,” or “Then Pharaoh/he {turned} to Joseph and said,”

“Since God has shown all this to you, 
“Since God has made all this known to you,” or “God has revealed to you what he is going to do, so”

{there is} no one {as} discerning 
“no one {else} is {as} intelligent/insightful as you {are}”. See how you translated “discerning and wise” in verse 33.

and wise as you.
“or knows what to do {in this situation}.” or “or can decide wisely about how to manage {this situation}.”


Gen 41:40 You will be over my house, and all my people will kiss on your mouth. Only I {on} the throne will be greater than you.”

You will be over my house, 
“{So} I am putting you in charge of my household {and my kingdom/country},” or “{So} I am giving you authority over {the people in} my palace {and the rest of my kingdom/country},” The phrase “my house” refers here to Pharaoh’s household and all the other people he rules as king. (See: figs-metonymy)

and all my people 
“so that all the people in my country/kingdom” or “so that all the people I reign over” 

will kiss on your mouth.
“must obey/do whatever you say/command.” or “will/must respect and obey whatever you tell them to do.” Consider whether you have a similar idiom in your language, or if you need to say this without an idiom. (See: figs-idiom)

Only I {on} the throne 
“Only I {who sit} {on} the throne {as king}” or “Only I who am king”. In this context, “the throne” refers to Pharaoh’s position as the king. Make sure that is clear in your translation. (See: figs-metonymy)

will be greater than you.”
“will have higher/more authority than you.”


Gen 41:41 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “See, I have put you over all the land of Egypt.” 

Then Pharaoh said to Joseph,
“Then Pharaoh said,” or “Pharaoh continued/added,” Some languages leave “Joseph” or even this entire quote margin implied here, since Pharaoh is still talking to the same person. Do what is best in your language. (See: writing-quotations)

“See, I have put you over
“Look/Listen, I hereby/now put you in charge of” or “I am now appointing/installing you to be {the manager/supervisor} over”. The word “See” emphasizes what Pharaoh says next.

all the land of Egypt.”
“the whole/entire land/country of Egypt.”


Gen 41:42 Then Pharaoh removed his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph’s hand. And he dressed him {in} garments of fine linen and put a gold chain on his neck.

Then Pharaoh removed his signet ring from his hand 
“Then Pharaoh/he took off his {official/royal} identification ring” or “Then Pharaoh took from his finger the ring that he used to mark/seal {documents/letters}”. The signet ring was the identification ring that the king used to seal official documents. See how you translated “signet” in Gen 38:18. (See: translate-unknown)

and put it on Joseph’s hand. 
“and put it on Joseph’s finger {to show that he had appointed him}.” or “and placed it on Joseph’s finger {showing he now had Pharaoh’s authority}”. The signet ring showed that Joseph represented Pharaoh and had his complete authority. (See: translate-symaction)

And he dressed him {in} garments of fine linen
“He also had Joseph put on fine/expensive linen clothes/robes” or “He {also} gave Joseph high-quality/expensive clothes/robes to wear”. The Hebrew word for “fine linen” refers to a special kind of white cloth that was woven out of flax and had a fine texture. Clothes made from linen were expensive and were worn by the king and high officials. If linen is not known in your language area, you could be more general and refer to expensive, high-quality clothes. (See: translate-unknown)

and put a gold chain on his neck. 
“and put a chain/collar {made} of gold around his neck.” or “and put around his neck a chain/necklace {made} of gold.”


Gen 41:43 Then he had him ride in the second chariot that {belonged} to him, and they shouted before him, “Bow down!” So he put him over all the land of Egypt.

Then he had him ride 
“Then Pharaoh had Joseph ride {around}”

in the second chariot that {belonged} to him, 
“in a royal {horse-drawn} chariot/cart as his second-in-command” or “in the {horse-drawn} chariot/cart that showed he was the second highest ruler in the country.” A chariot is a cart with two or four wheels that was pulled by one or more horses. It was used as transportation and was especially used in battles. Translate this in a way that fits with this description. It may be helpful to include a picture of a chariot in your translation. (See: translate-symaction)

and they shouted before him,
“{As he rode,} heralds/messengers {walked} {in the road/streets} ahead of him calling out {to everyone},” Make sure the way you translate “shouted” does not sound angry. Rather they were calling out loudly enough for people to hear them.

“Bow down!”
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. 1. It could be a transliteration of an Egyptian word that means, “Bow down {in reverence/respect}!” or “Make way {for the king’s appointed one}!” or “Welcome/Honor {your new leader}!”, which is what people would be told to do to honor an important person; 2. It could be a combination of Hebrew words that means, “{This is} {the} father of {the} king!” which is similar to what Joseph says in Gen 45:8. (See: translate-symaction)

So he put him over
“So Pharaoh put Joseph in charge of” or “In that way, Pharaoh {officially} appointed/installed Joseph to be {the manager/supervisor} over/of”. See how you translated a similar sentence in verse 41.

all the land of Egypt.
“the whole/entire land/country of Egypt.”

__________________Paragraph Break__________________ 
 
Gen 41:44 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I {am} Pharaoh, and without you a person will not lift his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt!” 

Then Pharaoh said to Joseph,
“Pharaoh {also} told Joseph,”

“I {am} Pharaoh, and 
“I, Pharaoh, {hereby command/decree} that”

without you a person will not lift his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt!” 
“no one throughout the whole/entire country of Egypt may do anything unless you tell them to do it!” or “throughout the whole/entire country of Egypt, everyone must only do what you tell them to do!” The phrase “will not lift his hand or foot” is hyperbole (exaggeration) that is used to emphasize joseph’s authority. Consider whether or not it is clear and natural to do that here in your language. (See: figs-hyperbole)


Gen 41:45 Then Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphenath-Paneah, and he gave to him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera the priest of On, as a wife. Then Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.

Then Pharaoh called Joseph’s name 
“Then Pharaoh called Joseph by the {Egyptian} name” or “Then Pharaoh gave Joseph the {Egyptian} name”

Zaphenath-Paneah,
“Zaphenath-Paneah {which means “explainer/revealer of secrets”},” or “Zaphenath-Paneah {which means “the one who explains/reveals secrets”},” (See: translate-names)

and he gave to him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera the priest of On, as a wife. 
“and he gave him {a woman named} Asenath to be {his} wife. {She was} the daughter of Potiphera, {who was} a priest {at the temple} in/at {the city of} On.” Potiphera was a pagan priest, who led people in worshiping the Egyptians’ gods, not Yahweh. See how you translated “priest” in Gen 14:18.

Then Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.
“Then Joseph started going/traveling around all over the land/country of Egypt.” or “Then Joseph {started his duties/work and} traveled throughout the land/country of Egypt.”

Gen 41:47 And in the seven years of abundance, the land produced {grain} by the handfuls.

And in the seven years of abundance, 
“During the seven years when food was abundant/plentiful,” or “For seven years the crops/harvests were abundant/plentiful and”. Compare how you translated “seven years of abundance” in verse 34.

the land produced {grain} by the handfuls.
“the land produced huge/large amounts of grain.” or “the people harvested huge/large amounts of grain from the land.” The idiom “by the handfuls” refers here to large amounts of grain. Consider whether your language has a similar idiom you could use here. (See: figs-idiom)


Gen 41:48 So he gathered all the food of the seven years that were in the land of Egypt, and he put the food in the cities. The food of the fields that surrounded {each} city he put inside it.

So he gathered 
“So Joseph {told the supervisors/administrators under him} to gather/collect” or “So Joseph {had his helpers} gather/collect”. When the Bible says that a leader such as Joseph did something, it often means that he had it done by people under his authority. Decide whether you want to include this information in your translation or in a footnote. (See: figs-explicit)

all the food of the seven years that were in the land of Egypt,
“all the {extra/surplus} food/grain that was produced/harvested in the land/country of Egypt during {those} seven years,” or “all the {extra/surplus} grain {that people harvested/produced} during {those} seven years in the land/country of Egypt,” See how you translated “all the food” in verse 35.

and he put the food in the cities.
“and he {had them} store/stockpile {that} grain in the cities.”

The food of the fields that surrounded {each} city he put inside it.
“The food/grain {that people had harvested} from the fields, he {had his supervisors/helpers} store/stockpile in the nearby cities.” or “In each city he {had them} store/stockpile the food/grain {that people had harvested} from the surrounding/nearby fields.” Consider what phrase order is best for this sentence in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 41:49 So Joseph stored up grain like the sand of the sea, very much, until he stopped measuring {it} because it was without number.

So Joseph stored up 
“In that way, Joseph stockpiled” or “Joseph {had his helpers} store up”. See how you translated “store/stockpile” in verse 35.

grain like 
“so much grain that it was/seemed/looked as {plentiful as}” 

the sand of the sea, 
“{grains of} sand beside the sea/ocean.” or “the {grains of} sand on the seashore.” See how you translated “as the sand of the sea” in Gen 32:12 and a similar phrase in Gen 22:17.

very much, until
“{In fact,} there was so much that” or “{In fact,} it was so plentiful that {after a while}”

he stopped measuring {it}
“he {had them} stop keeping records/track {of it}” or “he/they had to stop writing down how much there was,” It was probably Joseph’s helpers who measured the grain and kept records of it. See how you handled this at the beginning of this verse. 

because it was without number.
“because {there was so much that} he could no longer measure/record it.” or “because it was too much to keep track of.”

Gen 41:50 And before the years of the famine came, two sons were born to Joseph, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, the priest of On, bore for him. 

And before the years of the famine came, 
“Before the {seven} famine years started,” or “Now {it so happened that} before the {seven} years of famine came/started,” Consider the best way to change topics and begin this new paragraph in your language. (See: writing-newevent)

two sons were born to Joseph, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, the priest of On, bore for him. 
“Joseph had two sons with {his wife} Asenath, a daughter of Potiphera, {who was} a priest in {the city of} On.” or “Joseph and {his wife} Asenath had two sons. {Remember that} Asenath was a daughter of Potiphera, a priest {in the city} of On.” See how you translated “Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, the priest of On” in verse 45.
