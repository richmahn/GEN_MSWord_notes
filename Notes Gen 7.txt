7:1-23 Yahweh/God Sends The Flood

Gen 7:1 Then Yahweh said to Noah, “Go into the ark, you and all your household, because I have seen that you {are} righteous before me in this generation. 

Then Yahweh
“Then {after they had finished building the boat,} Yahweh” or “{When/After the ark/boat was finished,} Yahweh”. For some languages it may be necessary to make it explicit that the boat was completed before Yahweh told Noah to enter it. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-explicit)

said to Noah,
“told/commanded Noah,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Go into the ark, you and all your household,
“Enter/Board the ark/boat, along with your entire family,” or “You and your entire household/family must go/get into the ark/boat,” See how you translated “ark/boat” in Gen 6:14-16.

because I have seen
“because I have found” or “because I see/know”

that you {are}
“that you {alone} {are}” or “that you {are} {the only one who is}”. In the Hebrew text, the pronoun “you” is emphasized to show that Noah was the only one who was righteous.

righteous
“upright” or “living righteously/rightly” or “living the right way”. See how you translated “righteous” in Gen 6:9.

before me 
“in my sight/eyes/opinion” or “according to my standards”

in this generation.
“among the people living today.” For some languages it may be more natural to put this phrase earlier in this verse and say, “...you {are} {the only one} among the people living today {who is} righteous in my sight.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 7:2 From every clean animal take with you seven pairs, a male and its female, and from {every} animal that {is} not clean {take} two, a male and its female,

From every clean animal
“From every {kind of} pure animal” or “From every {kind of} animal that is acceptable to sacrifice”. It may be necessary to include a footnote that explains the concept of clean and unclean animals: In the Bible a “clean animal” was an animal that was acceptable to be sacrificed to God or to be eaten, and an “unclean animal” was one that could not be sacrificed or eaten; it does not refer to how clean the animal was physically. Later Moses wrote down the laws about clean and unclean animals in the book of Leviticus.

take with you 
“bring with you”. The pronoun “you” is singular in the Hebrew text, but could be translated as a plural to include Noah’s family. (See: figs-yousingular)

seven pairs, a male and its female,
“seven male and female pairs”. See how you translated “male and female” in Gen 6:19.

and from {every} animal that {is} not clean
“and from {every kind of} unclean/impure animal” or “and from {every kind of} animal that is not acceptable to sacrifice”

{take} two, a male and its female,
“{take} a/one male and female pair,” For some languages it may be better to change the order of the phrases in this sentence and say, “Take with you seven male and female pairs of every {kind of} clean/pure animal, and {one} male and female pair of {every kind of} unclean/impure animal,” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 7:3 also from {every} bird of the sky {take} seven pairs, male and female, to keep {their} offspring alive on the surface of the whole earth,

also 
“{and} also” or “In addition,” or “Also,” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

from {every} bird of the sky 
“from {every kind/type of} bird {that flies} in the sky/air” or “from {every kind/type of} bird”

{take} seven pairs, male and female, 
“{take} seven male and female pairs”. See how you translated a similar phrase in verse 2. Also, for some languages it may be better to put this phrase earlier in this sentence and say, “Also {take} seven male and female pairs of {every kind of} bird {that flies} in the sky/air,...” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

to keep {their} offspring alive
“so that {later} their offspring will live” or “so that {later} they will have offspring that will live” 

on the surface of the whole earth,
“{and spread} all over the earth,” or “and/to repopulate the whole/entire earth,”


Gen 7:4 because in seven more days I will cause it to rain on the earth {for} forty days and forty nights, and I will wipe every living thing that I have made off the surface of the ground.” 

because 
“{You must do that,} because” or “The reason {you must do that} is”. For many languages it is more natural to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-explicit)

in seven more days 
“seven days from now/today”. The phrase, “seven more days” could be translated “another week” here and in verse 11. However, it is probably best to keep the number seven in the text in both places, especially since the number seven often signifies perfection or completion in the Bible, perhaps also here.

I will cause it to rain
“I will make it rain {continuously}” or “I will send rain”

on the earth 
“{all} over the earth/world”

{for} forty days and forty nights,
“{for} forty days and nights,” This refers to forty complete 24-hour days.

and I will
“in order to” or “In that way, I will” or “That will”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. (See: grammar-connect-logic-goal)

wipe
“wash away” or “wipe/blot out” or “completely destroy”. See how you translated this idiom in Gen 6:7. (See: figs-idiom)

every living thing that I have made
“every living creature that I have made” or “all the living things/creatures that I have made”. See how you translated a similar phrase (“living creature”) in Gen 6:19.

off the surface of the ground.”
“off/from the surface of the earth.” or “off/from the earth/land.” It may be clearer to put this phrase earlier in the sentence and say, “in order to completely destroy from/off the ground/earth every living creature/thing that I have made.” Do what is best in your language. See how you translated this phrase in Gen 6:7. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 7:5 Then Noah did all that Yahweh had commanded him.

Then Noah did all that
“Then/So Noah did everything that” or “So Noah did everything {exactly} as”

Yahweh had commanded him.
“Yahweh had commanded/told him {to do}.” See how you translated Gen 6:22 which is similar to 7:5.

Gen 7:6 Now Noah {was} a son of 600 years when the floodwaters came on the earth. 

Now Noah {was} a son of 600 years when
“Noah/He was 600 years old when” or “When Noah was 600 years old,” See how you handled large numbers in Gen 5 and in Gen 6:3, and see the note about this at Gen 5:3. Also see how you translated the idiom “son of...years” in Gen 5:32. (See: translate-numbers)

the floodwaters came on the earth.
“the flood covered the earth.” or “the earth was covered/flooded with deep water.” For some languages it may be more natural to put this clause first in this sentence and say, “When the flood waters came on the earth, Noah was 600 years old.” Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated “floodwaters” in Gen 6:17. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 7:7 And Noah and his sons and his wife and the wives of his sons went with him into the ark from the presence of the waters of the flood.

And Noah and his sons and his wife and the wives of his sons went with him into the ark
“{That is when} Noah/he and his wife, and his sons and their wives, went together into the ark/boat”. Noah and his family entered the ark on the same day that the floodwaters started coming (see verses 11-13). See how you translated a similar list of people in Gen 6:18.

from the presence of
“because of” or “to escape from” or “to keep them safe from” or “so that they would not die in”

the waters of the flood.
“the floodwaters.” or “the flood.”


Gen 7:8 {Pairs} from the clean animal{s} and from the animal{s} that are not clean and from the bird{s} and everything that moves on the ground

{Pairs} from the clean animal{s} and from the animal{s} that are not clean
“{Also,} {every kind of} clean animal and {every kind of} unclean animal”. See how you translated “clean” and “unclean” animals in verse 2.

and from the bird{s} 
“and {every kind of} bird,”

and everything that moves on the ground
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean (1) “including every {kind of} creature/animal that moves/lives on land” or “which includes every {kind of} creature/animal that moves/lives on land“. According to this interpretation, the rest of verse 8 emphasizes that the clean and unclean animals and birds (verses 2-3, 8) were all creatures that lived on land (which are the creatures that the flood affected). (2) “as well as every {kind of} creature/animal that crawls/creeps along the ground”. According to this interpretation, the rest of verse 8 refers to a fourth category of creatures besides the clean animals, unclean animals, and birds.


Gen 7:9 went two {by} two to Noah into the ark, male and female, just as God had commanded Noah.

went two {by} two to Noah into the ark,
“came to Noah in pairs {and came/went} into the ark/boat,” or “came in pairs and entered the ark/boat with Noah,”

male and female,
“{They were} male and female pairs,” or “Each pair had one male and one female,” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

just as God had commanded Noah.
“which was exactly what God had commanded/told Noah/him {to take/bring along}.”

Gen 7:10 And it happened, after the seven days, then the waters of the flood came on the earth. 

And it happened, 
“So it happened {that}” or “Then”. This phrase focuses attention on an important event (the beginning of the flood), and it builds suspense so that readers and listeners wonder what will happen next.

after the seven days,
“when the seven days {that God had spoken about} had passed,” or “after seven days,” This phrase refers to the seven days which God talked about in verse 4. It does not mean seven days after Noah and the animals went into the ark (verses 7-9); they went into the ark on the same day that the flood started (verse 13). Translate the beginning of this sentence in a way that makes that clear. (See: figs-explicit)

then the waters of the flood came on 
“the floodwaters started to come on/over” or “water started to flood/cover”

the earth.
“the {entire/whole} earth.”


Gen 7:11 In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst open, and the windows of the heavens were opened, 

In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, 
“When Noah was 600 years old,” Compare how you translated Noah’s age in verse 6. (See: translate-ordinal)

in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, 
“on the seventeenth day of the second month {of the year},” For some languages it is more natural to switch the phrase order and say which day it is before giving the month. Do what is natural in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

on that day 
“on that {same/very} day” or “that is the day when”

all the fountains
“all the springs” or “all the {underground} water sources” 

of the great deep
“in the deep ocean”

burst open, 
“split/ripped open,” or “started gushing/pouring out water,” For some languages it may be more natural to put this phrase earlier and say, “water started gushing/pouring out of all the fountains/springs in the deep ocean,” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

and the windows of the heavens were opened, 
“and {all} the windows/floodgates in the heavens/sky were opened {by God},” or “{God also caused} the water in the heavens/sky to start coming/pouring down, as if he had opened {huge} windows/floodgates/faucets {in the heavens/sky},” (See: figs-metaphor)


Gen 7:12 so that the rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights. 

so that the rain fell 
“so that {torrential/heavy} rain fell/poured {continuously}” or “so that it rained {continuously}”

on the earth 
“{all} over the earth”

forty days and forty nights.
“{for} forty days and nights.” See how you translated this phrase in verse 4.

Gen 7:13 On that same day Noah and Shem and Ham and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and the wife of Noah and the three wives of his sons with them, went into the ark, 

On that same day 
“{So it was/happened that} on the {very} same day {that the flood/rain started},” This is the same day that is mentioned in verse 11, when the flood started. Verses 13-16 repeat what happened, in order to emphasize it. Make sure that a translation does not sound like this is the second (or third) time that Noah and his family and the animals entered the ark.

Noah and Shem and Ham and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and the wife of Noah and the three wives of his sons with them,
“Noah and his sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, along with his wife and his sons’ three wives {all}” or “Noah and his wife and his/their sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, and their three wives {all}”. See how you translated a similar sentence in verse 7.

went into the ark,
“entered/boarded the ark/boat,”


Gen 7:14 they and every living thing according to its kind, and every livestock according to its kind, and every moving creature moving on the earth according to its kind, and every bird according to its kind, every bird of every wing. 

they and 
“They had/took with them”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

every living thing according to its kind, and
In the Hebrew text this phrase is ambiguous. It can mean (1) “every kind of living thing/creature, including” (2) “every kind of wild animal, and”. The animal groups listed in verse 14 show that every kind of animal was to be brought onto the ark. Your language may have a different way of grouping animals. Make sure it is clear in your translation of this verse that all the different kinds of birds and land animals are included.

every livestock according to its kind,
“every kind of livestock,” or “every kind of domestic/tame animal,”

and every moving creature moving on the earth according to its kind,
In the Hebrew text, this phrase is ambiguous. It can mean (1) “and every {other} kind of creature/animal that moves/lives on the earth/land,” which seems to fit this context best. (2) “and every kind of creature/animal that crawls on the ground,”

and every bird according to its kind, every bird of every wing.
“and every kind of bird {and} everything {else} that has wings.” or “and every kind of bird {and} every {other} {kind of} creature that flies.” This phrase probably refers not only to birds, but also to other creatures that have wings and fly, such as bats and insects.


Gen 7:15 So they went to Noah into the ark, two {by} two from all flesh which {has} in it the breath of life. 

So they went to Noah into the ark,
“They came to Noah {and went/came} into the ark,” or “They entered the ark with Noah,” See how you translated a similar clause in verse 9.

two {by} two from all flesh
“pairs of every {kind of} creature/animal” or “pairs of every {kind of} living thing/creature”. The word “flesh” refers here to any kind of creature or animal. (See: figs-synecdoche)

which {has} in it the breath of life.
“that breathes {air}.” See how you translated this phrase in Gen 6:17. For some languages it may be better to change the order of the clauses in this verse and say, “Pairs of every {kind of} living thing that breathes {air} came to Noah {and went} into the boat.” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 7:16 And those that went in {were} male and female from all flesh; they went in just as God had commanded him. Then Yahweh shut him in.

And those that went in 
“The pairs/animals that went/came into {the ark/boat}” or “Those animals”. Consider whether it is better in your language to use “went” or “came” here. Also consider again how you translated “went” in verses 7, 9, 13, and 15. (See: figs-go)

{were} male and female
“{were} male and female {pairs}”

from all flesh; 
“from/of every {kind of} creature/animal,” or “from/of every {kind of} living thing,” See how you translated “all flesh” in verse 15. (See: figs-synecdoche)

they went in just as God had commanded him. 
“which was exactly what God had commanded him/Noah {to take/bring along}.” See how you translated “just as God commanded him” in verse 9.

Then Yahweh
“After that, Yahweh” or “Then {after they were all inside,} Yahweh”

shut him in.
“shut them in.” or “shut/closed the door {of the ark/boat} behind him/them.”

Gen 7:17 Then the flood came on the earth {for} forty days, and the waters increased and lifted the ark so that it rose up off the earth. 

Then the flood
“Then/And the floodwaters/water” or “After that the floodwaters/water”. Some translations do not include a conjunction here. Do what is natural in your language. (See: grammar-connect-time-sequential)

came
“kept coming” or “kept getting deeper and deeper”. Notice that verses 17-20 talk about the forty days and nights that the flood kept getting deeper and deeper. 

on the earth
“{all} over the earth”

{for} forty days,
“{for} forty days {and forty nights},” For some languages it may be more natural to put this time phrase first in this sentence and say, “{For} forty days {and forty nights} the flood kept getting deeper and deeper {all} over the earth,” Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated this phrase in verse 12. (See: figs-infostructure)

and the waters increased and
“and as the water level rose,” or “As the water got deeper and deeper”

lifted the ark so that it rose up off the earth.
“it lifted up the ark/boat so that it floated {on the water} {high} above the earth/ground.” or “it made the ark/boat lift/rise up off the ground and float.”


Gen 7:18 And the waters rose and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark went on the surface of the waters. 

 And the waters 
“So the floodwaters” or “Yes, the floodwaters/water” or “The floodwaters/water”. Verse 18 repeats some of verse 17 to emphasize what happened. Some translations do not include the conjunction (“And”) here. Do what is best in your language. (See: grammar-connect-words-phrases)

all the high mountains 
“{even} all the highest mountains”

that {were} under the entire heavens 
“everywhere under the sky”

were covered.
“were covered {with/by water}.” or “were submerged {in/under water}.” or “were under water.” For some languages it is better to use an active form of the verb here and say, “Eventually the water became so deep on the earth that it {even} covered all the highest mountains under the entire sky.” Do what is best in your language. (figs-activepassive)


Gen 7:20 The waters rose fifteen cubits above {them}, so that the mountains were covered.

The waters rose fifteen cubits above {them},
“{In fact,} the water rose {at least} seven meters above {the tops of} the {highest} mountains,” or “{In fact,} the {highest} mountain tops were covered with/by {at least} twenty-two feet of water,” See how you translated “cubits” in Gen 6:15-16. (See: translate-bdistance)

so that the mountains 
“so that they”. Consider whether it is better in your language to use a noun or a pronoun here to refer to the mountains. (See: writing-pronouns)

Then all flesh 
“Then all the creatures/beings” or “Then every creature” or “Then every living thing”. This phrase refers to everything listed in verse 21, including people. See how you translated this phrase in Gen 6:17. 

that moved on the earth
“that moved/lived on the ground” or “that lived on land”

expired,
“breathed out {its last breath},“ or “died/perished,” See how you translated this idiom in Gen 6:17. (See: figs-idiom)

the birds and the livestock 
“{all} the birds, the livestock,” or “{all} the birds, the domestic/tame animals,”

In the Hebrew text this phrase is ambiguous. It can mean (1) “and the {other} living things/creatures” (2) “and the wild animals”

and all the swarming things swarming on the earth,
“including every {kind of} creature/animal that lived in large groups/numbers on the earth,”

and all mankind.
