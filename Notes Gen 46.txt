46:1-27 Jacob And His Family Move To Egypt

Gen 46:1 Then Israel set out and all that {belonged} to him. Then he came to Beersheba, and he sacrificed sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac.

Then Israel set out and all that {belonged} to him.
“So Israel started the journey {to Egypt} with all his {family members and} belongings/possessions.” or “So Israel {and his family} started traveling {toward Egypt} with all his/their belongings.”

Then he came to Beersheba, and
“When they reached {the city of} Beersheba,”

he sacrificed sacrifices 
“he offered sacrifices/offerings” or “offered/burned some of his animals {on an altar} {there} as sacrifices”. See how you translated “sacrificed” in Gen 31:54.

to the God of his father Isaac.
“to God, whom his father Isaac worshiped/served.”


Gen 46:2 And God spoke to Israel in visions of the night and said, “Jacob! Jacob!” And he said, “Behold me.”

And God spoke to Israel in visions of the night and said, “Jacob! Jacob!” 
“During the night God spoke/called to Israel in a vision, “Jacob! Jacob!” “ or “That night, God {appeared/came to} Israel in a vision and said to him, “Jacob, Jacob.” “ God repeats Jacob’s name to communicate that he has something urgent or important to tell him. Make sure your translation of this phrase does not sound angry or critical. Also see how you translated “vision” in Gen 15:1.
 
And he said, 
“Israel/Jacob replied {to him},” For some languages, it is more natural to put this quotation margin (“he said”) after the quote. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

“Behold me.” 
“Here I am, {Lord/Master}.” or “Yes, {Lord/Master}?” or “I am listening, {Lord}.” Consider again how you translated the idiom “Behold me” throughout the book of Genesis. See Gen 22:1, 7, 11; 27:1, 18; 31:11; 37:13 ; 46:2. (See: figs-idiom)


Gen 46:3 And he said, “I {am} God, the God of your father. Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, because I will make you into a great nation there. 

And he said, 
“Then God said {to him},” (See: writing-quotations)

“I {am} God, the God of your father.
“I {am} God, the God whom your father serves/worships.” See how you translated “the God of” in verse 1.

Do not be afraid 
“Don’t be afraid” or “You must not be afraid” 

to go down to Egypt,
“to move down to {the country of} Egypt,” or “to go/travel to {the country of} Egypt {and settle there},”

because I will make you into
“because I will make you {and your family/descendants} become” or “because I will make your family/descendants {multiply and} become” or “because I will give you {many} descendants, who will become”. See how you translated “I will make you into a great nation” (and similar phrases) in Gen 12:2; 17:20; 18:18; 21:13, 18. (See: figs-metonymy)

a great nation there.
“an important/large ethnic/people group {while they live} there.”


Gen 46:4 I myself will go down with you to Egypt, and I myself will also surely bring you up. And Joseph will put his hand over your eyes.”

I myself will go down with you to Egypt, 
“I myself/personally will go with you to Egypt,” or “I will personally go with you down to Egypt {and take care of you there}.” Consider what is the best way to translate the emphatic pronoun “I” here and in the next clause. Also see how you translated “down” and “up” in Gen 45:9.

and I myself will also surely bring you up. 
“Later I will definitely bring your descendants {back} {here} {to Canaan}.” The pronoun “you” refers here to Jacob’s descendants. (See: figs-metonymy)

And Joseph will put his hand over your eyes.”
“And {when you die}, Joseph will {be right there to} close your eyes.” or “When you die, Joseph will be with you.” This clause refers to the custom of closing a person’s eyes after he died and means that Joseph would be with Jacob when he died. (See: figs-euphemism)

Gen 46:5 Then Jacob got up from Beersheba, and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father and their little ones and their wives in the carts that Pharaoh had sent to carry him. 

Then Jacob got up from Beersheba, 
“Then/So Jacob left {the city of} Beersheba,” or “After that, Jacob {whose other name was Israel} left {the city of} Beersheba,” Be consistent with how you spell “Beersheba” throughout the book of Genesis. See Gen 21:14, 31-33; 22:19; 26:23, 33; 28:10; 46:1, 5.

and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father 
“and his sons, the sons of Israel, took/transported {him} their father” or “and his sons, {that is} the sons of Israel, took/transported him” or “and his sons took/transported him”. “Israel” is the name that God gave to Jacob (Gen 32:28, 35:10). In chapters 45 and 46, the text repeatedly switches back and forth between both of Jacob’s names. Make sure it is clear in your translation that these two names refer to the same person. You could include a footnote that helps readers understand what is happening.

and their little ones and their wives 
“as well as their children and wives” or “and their wives and children”. See how you translated “little ones and...wives” in Gen 45:19. (See: figs-infostructure)

in the carts 
“in the wagons”. See how you translated “carts” in Gen 45:19, 21, 27. 

that Pharaoh 
“that {King} Pharaoh” or “that Pharaoh {the king of Egypt}” or “that the king {of/over Egypt}”. For a note about how “Pharaoh” is used like a name in the Bible, see Gen 12:15. (See: translate-names)

had sent
“had sent {to Canaan}” or “had provided”

to carry him.
“to transport him/them {to Egypt}.” or “for them to ride in/on {to Egypt}.” The pronoun “him” refers to Jacob, the head of his family. and includes Jacob’s wives and children. It may be necessary to use the plural pronoun “them” to make that clear. (See: figs-synecdoche)

 
Gen 46:6 And they took their livestock and their possessions that they had acquired in the land of Canaan. Then they came to Egypt, Jacob and all of his offspring with him. 

And they took their livestock 
“They {also} took/brought {with them} their livestock/animals”

and their possessions 
“and their {other} belongings”. Consider again how you translated “possessions” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 12:5 (and note); 13:6; 14:11-12, 16, 21; 15:14; 31:18; 36:7; 46:6. It may be necessary to translate this term in slightly different ways, depending on the context.

that they had acquired 
“that they had accumulated/gotten”. Consider again how you translated “acquired” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 12:5; 31:18; 36:6; 46:6.

in the land of Canaan. 
“in the region of Canaan.” or “in Canaan.”

Then they came to Egypt, Jacob and all of his offspring with him,
“Then Jacob and all of his descendants arrived in Egypt.”


Gen 46:7 his sons and his sons’ sons with him, his daughters and his sons’ daughters. So all his offspring he brought with him to Egypt.

 his sons and his sons’ sons with him, his daughters and his sons’ daughters.
“{including} his sons and grandsons, {and} his daughters and granddaughters.” or “{including} his sons, daughters, grandsons, and granddaughters.” or “{including} his sons and daughters, {and} his grandsons and granddaughters.” Consider what is the best way in your language to list these descendants. (See: translate-kinship)

So all his offspring he brought with him to Egypt.
“{Yes,} he/Jacob brought his entire family with him to Egypt.” or “He/Jacob had all his offspring/descendants with him when he arrived in Egypt.” For some languages, it may be clearer or more natural to change the order of the clauses in this verse and say, “He/Jacob brought his entire {extended} family with him to Egypt, {including} his sons...” Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-infostructure)

Gen 46:8 Now these {are} the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt, Jacob and his sons: the firstborn of Jacob {was} Reuben.

Now these {are} the names of the sons of Israel who went to Egypt, Jacob and his sons: 
“Here is a list of the names of Israel’s descendants who went/came {with him} to Egypt, {that is,} Jacob’s descendants:” or “The following list gives the names of Israel’s descendants, {that is,} Jacob’s descendants, who went/came {with him} to Egypt:” 

the firstborn of Jacob {was} Reuben.
“Reuben {who was} his/Jacob’s firstborn/oldest {son},”


Gen 46:9 And the sons of Reuben {were} Hanoch and Pallu and Hezron and Carmi. 

And the sons of Reuben {were} 
“and Reuben’s sons, {who were}” or “and Reuben’s sons:” Throughout this section (verses 9-27), some translations use a colon before each list of names, with or without “were”. Do what is best in your language.

Hanoch and Pallu and Hezron and Carmi.
“Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.” For some languages it is more natural to include “and” between every name in a list like this. For other languages it is more natural to use commas between names and leave “and” implied, except before the last name in the list. See how you translated similar lists of names in Genesis 10. 


Gen 46:10 And the sons of Simeon {were} Jemuel and Jamin and Ohad and Jakin and Zohar and Shaul, the son of a Canaanite woman.

And the sons of Simeon {were}

“{Issachar and} Issachar’s sons, {who were}”

Tola and Puvah and Job and Shimron. 
“Tola, Puvah/Puah, Job/Jashub, and Shimron.” Numbers 26:24 and 1 Chronicles 7:1 have the same list of Issachar’s sons as here, but instead of “Puvah” and “Job”, they have “Puah” and “Jashub”. Some translations keep the spelling for these names the same in all three locations to avoid confusion. Do what is best in your language. (See: translate-names)


Gen 46:14 And the sons of Zebulun {were} Sered and Elon and Jahleel. 

And the sons of Zebulun {were}

Gen 46:29 Then Joseph harnessed his chariot and went up to meet Israel his father in Goshen. And he appeared to him, then he fell on his neck and cried on his neck a long time. 

Then Joseph harnessed his chariot 
“Then Joseph got his chariot/cart ready” or “Then Joseph {had his servants} get his chariot/cart ready”. Joseph may have harnessed his horses to his chariot himself, or he may have had his servants do that for him (which was usual for a powerful person like him). Consider how you translated similar situations in Gen 41:48. Also see how you translated “chariot” in Gen 41:43. (See: figs-explicit)

and went up to meet Israel his father in Goshen.
“and went to Goshen to meet his father Israel.” See how you translated “went up” in Gen 13:1 and “go up” in Gen 45:9.

“Now I can die, 
”Now I can/will die {happy},” or “Now when I die {I will be at peace},” Jacob did not die until 17 years later (Genesis 47:28). Make sure your translation of this clause does not mean or imply that Jacob wanted to die soon or that he thought he would die soon.

since I have seen your face 
“since/because I have seen you face-to-face” or “since/because I have seen you in person”. In this context, “your face” refers to Joseph, not just his face. Decide what is the best way to communicate that in your language. (See: figs-synecdoche)

then you should say, 
“you should/must tell {him},” (See: writing-quotations)

‘Your servants have been livestock men from our youth and until now, 
“Your Majesty/Highness, we have raised livestock since the time we were youths/young,” or “Sir, ever since the time we were young until now, we have been raising livestock,” The phrase “your servants” shows respect to Pharaoh and acknowledges his high position; it does not mean that Pharaoh actually owns Joseph’s brothers as servants. Translate this in a polite way that shows respect toward Pharaoh. Also, see how you translated “livestock men” in verse 32. (See: figs-123person)

both we {and} also our fathers,’ 
“{which is} the same occupation that our forefathers/ancestors had.” See how you translated “fathers” in Gen 15:15.

so that 
“That way” or “If {you say} that, {then}”

you can settle
“you will be permitted/allowed to live {separately/privately}” or “{he/Pharaoh} will permit/allow} you to live {separately/privately}”. The idea here is that Jacob’s family would be permitted to live in rural areas to raise their livestock away from most Egyptians, who despised sheep herders. (See: figs-explicit)

in the land of Goshen,
“in the region/territory of Goshen,” or “in Goshen Province/County,”

because 
“{especially} because/since” 

every herder of sheep {is} an abomination {to} Egyptians.”
“sheep herders are detestable {to} Egyptians.” or “the people of Egypt have disdain/contempt for sheep herders.” or “Egyptians despise/detest everyone who raises sheep.” For some languages it is clearer and more natural to change the order of phrases in this clause. Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated “abomination” in Gen 43:32. (See: figs-infostructure)
