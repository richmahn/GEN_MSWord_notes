GEN	1	1	z2zp	figs-abstractnouns	בְּ⁠רֵאשִׁ֖ית	1	In the beginning	“At the beginning {of time/everything}” or “{Everything} began when”. Many Bible scholars think that verse one records God’s first act in creating the universe. This is also the traditional, historically-held view and fits with the narrative structure of the Hebrew text, as well as the wider context of Scriptures which states that God created everything out of nothing at the very beginning of the world (Psalm 33:6, 9; Hebrews 11:3). See the chapter introduction for more details about different interpretations of Genesis 1:1. Also, some languages must use a verb (“began”) in verse 1 rather than a noun (“beginning”). Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns]])
GEN	1	1	a6w7	translate-key-terms	אֱלֹהִ֑ים	1	God	Translate the title “God” in a way that refers to the Supreme Being who created everything, who has complete power, who knows everything and is present everywhere. He is the only true God and has always existed. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms]])
GEN	1	1	emm9	translate-key-terms	בָּרָ֣א	1	created	“made”. In the Hebrew Bible, the verb “create” refers to an activity that only God does, and it often implies (as it does here) that he made something out of nothing. Also, the forms of the verbs in the Hebrew text (and the conjunctions) show that chapter one is a narrative that tells about true history and events in the order that things actually happened. Make sure that your translation does the same thing. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms]])
GEN	1	1	u14i	translate-key-terms	אֵ֥ת הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֖יִם	1	the heavens	“the sky”. This phrase refers here to the region where all the stars and planets would later exist. Keep that in mind as you translate this term. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms]])
GEN	1	1	ujfe	translate-key-terms	וְ⁠אֵ֥ת הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	and the earth.	This phrase refers to the planet earth. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms]])
GEN	1	2	aejz		וְ⁠הָ⁠אָ֗רֶץ	1	Now the earth	“Now {at first after that,} the earth” or “{At first after that,} the earth”. The author pauses here to describe what the earth was like after God first created it (verse 1). Some languages use a conjunction like “Now” to introduce that information; other languages do not use a conjunction here. Do what is natural in your language. Also, be consistent here with how you translated “the earth” in verse 1.
GEN	1	2	j7bn		הָיְתָ֥ה תֹ֨הוּ֙ וָ⁠בֹ֔הוּ	1	was formless and empty,	It is not clear what the earth looked like at that time, but it did not have its present shape and order. Also, the Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) “was formless/shapeless and empty/desolate,” or “did not have {its present} form, and there was nothing {living} on it {yet},” (2) “completely empty/desolate,” which is a hendiadys. However it is best to keep both terms separate in your translation (as in the first interpretation).
GEN	1	2	y5q7		וְ⁠חֹ֖שֶׁךְ עַל פְּנֵ֣י תְה֑וֹם	1	and darkness {was} over the surface of the deep {waters},	“It was {totally/completely} dark, there was deep {water} {everywhere},” or “There was deep {water} {everywhere} {that was covered/surrounded} in/by {complete/total} darkness,” For some languages it is more natural to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language.
GEN	1	2	vb0t		וְ⁠ר֣וּחַ אֱלֹהִ֔ים מְרַחֶ֖פֶת	1	and the Spirit of God was hovering	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) “and God’s Spirit was hovering/moving” (2) “and a wind from God was blowing” (3) “and a powerful wind was blowing”. The first interpretation is most likely, since the Hebrew verb “hovering” does not describe what wind does.
GEN	1	2	vf9g		עַל פְּנֵ֥י הַ⁠מָּֽיִם	1	over the surface of the waters.	“over the surface of the water.” or “above the waters/water.” Throughout this chapter, the word “waters” is in the plural in the Hebrew text. For some languages it is more natural to use the singular “water”. Do what is best in your language in each context.
GEN	1	3	y0w9	writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֥אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	Then God said,	“Then God commanded,” What God says in verse 3 is a command. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to make that explicit in this quote margin. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	1	3	dpuh		יְהִ֣י א֑וֹר	1	“Let there be light.”	“Let light exist.” or “I command there to be light.” or “I command light to start shining!” This is a command, not permission or a suggestion. It is a direct quote of what God actually said, and it is usually put between quotation marks in a translation. If you use an exclamation mark with this command in your translation, make sure it does not mean or imply that God was angry. Also, the way you translate “light” should refer to what shines from a source of light; it does not refer here to the source itself.
GEN	1	3	b14k		וַֽ⁠יְהִי אֽוֹר	1	And there was light.	“And/So {immediately} there was light.” or “And {so/immediately} light started shining.” Light began to shine immediately as a result of God’s command.
GEN	1	4	astv	grammar-connect-words-phrases	וַ⁠יַּ֧רְא אֱלֹהִ֛ים	1	And God saw	“And he saw/observed” or “God/He saw/observed”. Notice that Hebrew frequently uses a conjunction such as “And” or “Then” at the beginning of a sentence. Some languages do not use conjunctions as frequently as Hebrew does. Do what is accurate and natural in your language in each context. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
GEN	1	4	yw30	translate-key-terms	אֶת הָ⁠א֖וֹר כִּי ט֑וֹב	1	the light, that {it was} good.	“that the light {was} good/excellent.” In the Bible, “good” is an important theme. Throughout chapter one, it especially means that what God created was high quality, complete, and had no defects; in other words, it had all the characteristics and functions that God intended it to have. It also includes the idea that what God created was untainted by sin and reflected his good character (Psalm 19:1; Romans 1:20). The focus here is not on how pleased or satisfied God was. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms]])
GEN	1	4	bgiw	writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יַּבְדֵּ֣ל אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	Then God	“Then he”. In order to produce an accurate and natural translation, it is important in each context to make sure that nouns (such as “God”) and pronouns (such as “he”) are used properly in your language. In the Hebrew text, “God” is repeated frequently in chapter one to emphasize him and show that he is in focus. For some languages it is more natural to say “God” only once at the beginning of each paragraph or section, and then use pronouns to refer to him the rest of the time (or most of the time). Throughout chapter one, do what is best in your language each time that God is referred to. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	1	4	ycoe		וַ⁠יַּבְדֵּ֣ל בֵּ֥ין הָ⁠א֖וֹר וּ⁠בֵ֥ין הַ⁠חֹֽשֶׁךְ	1	separated between the light and the darkness.	“separated/divided the light from the darkness {so that each had its own time}.” or “caused the light to have its own time and the darkness to have its own time.” or “separated the light from the darkness {so that it would be light for a number of hours, and then dark for a number of hours}.”
GEN	1	5	jtgm	grammar-connect-words-phrases	וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֨א אֱלֹהִ֤ים	1	And God called	“Then God/he called/named” or “God/He called/named”. Some languages omit the connecting word “And” or “Then” here. Consider the best way in your language to connect this sentence with the previous one. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
GEN	1	5	o3p7		לָ⁠אוֹר֙ י֔וֹם	1	the light Day,	“the light Daytime.” Notice that in this context the word “Day” refers only to the time when the sun is shining, not to the 24-hour time period that makes up a complete day. Make sure that this is clear in your translation. Throughout chapter one, some translations use quote marks around the names that God gives the different things he created.
GEN	1	5	a176		וְ⁠לַ⁠חֹ֖שֶׁךְ קָ֣רָא לָ֑יְלָה	1	and the darkness he called Night.	“and the darkness he called/named Nighttime.” or “and he called/named the darkness Nighttime.” In the Hebrew text, “the darkness” is first in this clause to emphasize the contrast between the light and the darkness. Consider the best way to translate this clause in your language.
GEN	1	5	dpeo	grammar-connect-time-sequential	וַֽ⁠יְהִי עֶ֥רֶב וַֽ⁠יְהִי בֹ֖קֶר	1	Then there was evening, and there was morning,	“Then evening came and {then/later} morning came,” The evening and the morning are the parts of a 24-hour day that separate the hours of daytime (light) from the hours of nighttime (darkness): Evening came at the end of each daytime after God finished his work of creating. Then after about 12 hours of nighttime, morning came, which began the next 12 hours of daytime when God did more work. Make sure your translation does not sound like morning came immediately after evening. Some languages have a one-word conjunction that means “and then” or “and later” that fits well here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])
GEN	1	5	lrrn	translate-ordinal	י֥וֹם אֶחָֽד	1	one day.	“{and that was} day one.” or “{and that was} {the end of} the first day.” Here “day” refers to a full 24-hour day. Also, the Hebrew text uses a cardinal number (“one”) here, but then uses ordinal numbers (“second”, “third”, and so on) for the rest of the days of creation week. Some languages need to use an ordinal number (“first”) here too. Other languages use cardinal numbers throughout (“day one”, “day two”, and so on). Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
GEN	1	6	xwgy	writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	Then God said,	“Then God commanded,” See how you translated this phrase in verse 3. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	1	6	yohb		יְהִ֥י רָקִ֖יעַ	1	“Let there be an expanse	“Let there be a large/vast space” or “I command there to be a {large/vast} expanse/space” or “I command a large/vast space to form/exist”. The Hebrew word for “expanse” here describes a large space that is “spread out.” It was not solid, rather it was open and empty and could be seen through and flown through (verse 20). It was probably also curved, following the spherical shape of the earth. See how you translated “Let there be” in verse 3.
GEN	1	6	gf47		בְּ⁠ת֣וֹךְ הַ⁠מָּ֑יִם	1	in the middle of the waters,	“in the middle of the water,” See how you translated “waters” in verse 2.
GEN	1	6	csx5		מַ֖יִם לָ⁠מָֽיִם	1	and let it separate the waters from the waters.”	“and let it separate/divide the water {above it} from the water {below it}.” or “so that it separates/divides the waters/water into two separate/different places.”
GEN	1	7	oqd8		וַ⁠יַּ֣עַשׂ אֱלֹהִים֮	1	So God made	“In that way God/he made/created” or “That is how God/he made/created”. Verse 7 explains what God’s command in verse 6 caused to happen, and it repeats some of the same words and phrases. Make sure that your translation of these verses does not sound like God created the expanse twice.
GEN	1	7	uwh1		אֶת הָ⁠רָקִיעַ֒	1	the expanse	“a large/vast space”
GEN	1	7	ax7s		וַ⁠יַּבְדֵּ֗ל	1	and separated	“and divided” or “and used it to separate/divide”
GEN	1	7	urlx	writing-pronouns	בֵּ֤ין הַ⁠מַּ֨יִם֙ אֲשֶׁר֙ מִ⁠תַּ֣חַת לָ⁠רָקִ֔יעַ וּ⁠בֵ֣ין הַ⁠מַּ֔יִם אֲשֶׁ֖ר מֵ⁠עַ֣ל לָ⁠רָקִ֑יעַ	1	between the waters that {were} under the expanse and the waters that {were} above the expanse.	“the water that {was} below the expanse/space from the water that {was} above it.” or “the water that {was} under/below it from the water that {was} above it.” For some languages it is more natural to use a pronoun (“it”) here to refer to the expanse, since it was just mentioned earlier in the verse. Each language has its own system of when to use nouns or pronouns to refer to people, places and things. In each context, do what is clear and natural in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	1	7	fvgh	figs-explicit	וַֽ⁠יְהִי כֵֽן	1	And it was so.	“That is the way it happened.” or “Everything was/happened {exactly} as he commanded {it to be/happen}.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	1	8	s35q	grammar-connect-words-phrases	וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֧א אֱלֹהִ֛ים	1	And God called	“and God/he called/named” or “God/He called/named”. Consider whether it is more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here (with or without a conjunction), or to continue the sentence that began at the end of verse 7. Also see how you translated this phrase in verse 5. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
GEN	1	8	yrk7		לָֽ⁠רָקִ֖יעַ	1	the expanse	“the large/vast space”. See how you translated this phrase in verses 6 and 7.
GEN	1	8	p4cu	translate-key-terms	שָׁמָ֑יִם	1	Heavens.	“Sky.” This word probably refers here to the atmosphere above the earth’s surface where clouds are and where birds fly, as well as the space where the sun, moon, and stars are now. See how you translated this term in verse 1. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms]])
GEN	1	8	hker		וַֽ⁠יְהִי עֶ֥רֶב וַֽ⁠יְהִי בֹ֖קֶר	1	Then there was evening, and there was morning,	“Then evening came and {then/later} morning came,” See how you translated this sentence in verse 5, and see the note about that there.
GEN	1	8	ada9	translate-ordinal	י֥וֹם שֵׁנִֽי	1	the second day.	“{and that was} {the end of} the second day.” or “{and} the second day ended.” or “{and that was} {the end of} day two.” Consider whether it is more natural in your language to use an ordinal number (“second”) here or a cardinal number (“two”). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
GEN	1	9	f2jd	writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֗ים	1	Then God said,	“Then God commanded,” See how you translated this phrase in verses 3 and 6. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	1	9	pgf1	figs-activepassive	יִקָּו֨וּ הַ⁠מַּ֜יִם מִ⁠תַּ֤חַת הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֨יִם֙	1	“Let the waters under the heavens be gathered	“Let the water {that is} under the heavens/sky gather/come together” or “I command the water {that is} below the heavens/sky to gather/come together”. Consider whether it is better here in your language to use a passive form of the verb (“be gathered”) or an active form (“gather” or “come”). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
GEN	1	9	l3rh		אֶל מָק֣וֹם אֶחָ֔ד	1	to one place,	“in one place/area” or “into one area”
GEN	1	9	xgx1		וְ⁠תֵרָאֶ֖ה הַ⁠יַּבָּשָׁ֑ה	1	and let the dry ground appear.”	“so that there is dry ground/land.” or “so that dry ground/land can be seen.” or “so that land is uncovered and dries off.” The water had been covering the land, so when the water receded from it, the land became exposed and dried off. Make sure that the way you translate “dry ground” does not sound like the land was dry while it was under the water.
GEN	1	9	e81e		וַֽ⁠יְהִי כֵֽן	1	And it was so.	“And that is {exactly} what happened.” or “And it was/happened {exactly} as God commanded {it to be/happen}.” See how you translated this sentence in verse 7. It may be necessary to translate it in different ways, depending on the context.
GEN	1	10	my9o		וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֨א אֱלֹהִ֤ים	1	And God called	“Then God/he called/named”
GEN	1	10	dv3r		לַ⁠יַּבָּשָׁה֙	1	the dry ground	“the dry land” or “the ground/land that had dried off”
GEN	1	10	uwpz		אֶ֔רֶץ	1	Land,	“Ground,” This is the same Hebrew word that is translated as “earth” in verse 1, but here it refers to the dry land or ground (in contrast to the water), not the entire planet.
GEN	1	10	wt11	figs-infostructure	וּ⁠לְ⁠מִקְוֵ֥ה הַ⁠מַּ֖יִם קָרָ֣א	1	and the gathered waters he called	“and the waters/water that he had gathered together he called/named” or “and he called/named the gathered waters” or “and he called/named the waters/water that had gathered/come together”. See how you translated a sentence in verse 5 that is similar in structure to this sentence. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	1	10	zd94		יַמִּ֑ים	1	Seas.	“Oceans.” or “Sea/Ocean.” At that time there was probably just one very large body of water and one very large land mass on the earth (as verse 9 indicates). So a singular noun that refers to the largest body of water, such as “Ocean” or “Sea”, could be used here in your translation.
GEN	1	10	j9zm	writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יַּ֥רְא אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	And God saw	“And he saw/observed” or “God/He saw/observed”. Decide whether it is more natural in your language to use a noun (“God”) or a pronoun (“he”) in this context. See how you translated this phrase in verse 4. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	1	10	pyq5		כִּי טֽוֹב	1	that {it was} good.	“that {what he had made was} good/excellent.” or “that {the land and the seas/ocean were} good/excellent.” Some languages cannot use a pronoun (“it”) here, but have to specify what was good. Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated the word “good” in verse 4, and see the note about that there.
GEN	1	11	jslr	writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֗ים	1	Then God said,	“Then God commanded,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	1	11	vfz2		תַּֽדְשֵׁ֤א הָ⁠אָ֨רֶץ֙	1	“Let the land	“I command the land/ground to” or “The land/ground must now”. Notice that when God commands the land to do something, it obeys him. See how you translated “Land” in verse 10.
GEN	1	11	xqd3		תַּֽדְשֵׁ֤א דֶּ֔שֶׁא	1	sprout vegetation:	“grow/produce {green} plants,” or “be covered with {green} plants,” The Hebrew word for “vegetation” refers generally here to any kind of green plant and includes the plants and trees that are mentioned next in this verse.
GEN	1	11	tyjk		עֵ֚שֶׂב מַזְרִ֣יעַ זֶ֔רַע	1	{every} plant yielding seed,	“{including} {every kind/type of} plant that produces/has seeds” or “{including} {all kinds/types of} plants that produce/have seeds”. This phrase refers to many different kinds of plants, not just one plant or one seed. Make sure that is clear in your translation. Also, these kinds of plants have soft stems and include vegetable plants, herbs and other plants that produce edible seeds, such as rice, corn and wheat.
GEN	1	11	v9ot		עֵ֣ץ פְּרִ֞י עֹ֤שֶׂה פְּרִי֙ לְ⁠מִינ֔⁠וֹ	1	{every} fruit tree bearing fruit according to its kind,	“{and} fruit trees that bear/produce fruit, {each} according to its {own} kind/type,” or “{and} {every kind/type of} fruit tree that bears/produces/has its own kind/type of fruit” or “{and} {all kinds/types of} fruit trees that bear/produce/have their own kind/type of fruit”. The phrase “according to its kind” emphasizes that each different kind of tree produces its own kind of fruit and seeds, which grow and become only that kind of tree. For example, apple trees always produce apples with apple seeds, never peaches or cherries, or any other kind of fruit or seeds.
GEN	1	11	furs		אֲשֶׁ֥ר זַרְע⁠וֹ ב֖⁠וֹ	1	that {has} its seed inside it,	“that {has} seeds inside,” or “with seeds inside,” or “with its {own kind/type of} seeds inside it,”
GEN	1	11	wqag	figs-infostructure	עַל הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	on the earth.”	“throughout the earth.” or “all over the earth.” For some languages it is clearer and more natural to put this phrase earlier in this verse and say, “Let the land sprout vegetation on/throughout the earth...” Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	1	11	ngwx		וַֽ⁠יְהִי כֵֽן	0	And it was so.	“And that is {exactly} what happened:” or “And it/everything happened {exactly} as God commanded {it to happen}:” Either a period or a colon can be used here, but a colon more clearly shows that verse 12 gives the details of what happened. This is different from verse 7 where the details of what happened come before “And it was so”, and from verse 9 where no additional details are given.
GEN	1	12	dnd7		וַ⁠תּוֹצֵ֨א הָ⁠אָ֜רֶץ דֶּ֠שֶׁא	1	So the land brought out vegetation:	“The land sprouted/produced vegetation/plants,” or “The land started growing/producing {green} plants,” Verse 12 explains what God’s command in verse 11 caused to happen, and it repeats some of the same words and phrases. Make sure that your translation of these verses does not sound like God created the plants twice.
GEN	1	12	a2p4		עֵ֣שֶׂב מַזְרִ֤יעַ זֶ֨רַע֙ לְ⁠מִינֵ֔⁠הוּ	1	{every} plant yielding seed according to its kind,	“{including} plants that produce/have seeds, {each} according to its {own} kind/type,” or “{including} {every kind/type of} plant that produces/has seeds that grow into the same kind/type of plant,” or “{including} {all kinds/types of} plants that produce/have their own kind/type of seeds,”

GEN	1	12	enot	grammar-connect-words-phrases	וַ⁠יַּ֥רְא אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	And God saw	“And he saw/observed” or “God/He saw/observed”. Consider whether or not it is more natural in your language to begin this sentence with a conjunction. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
GEN	1	12	nbk3	figs-explicit	כִּי טֽוֹב	1	that {it was} good.	“that {what he had made/created was} good/excellent.” or “that {all the plants and trees were} good/excellent.” See how you translated this clause in verse 10. Some languages have to specify what was good. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	1	13	v6hy		וַֽ⁠יְהִי עֶ֥רֶב וַֽ⁠יְהִי בֹ֖קֶר	1	Then there was evening, and there was morning,	“Then evening came and {then/later} morning came,” See how you translated this sentence in verses 5 and 8.
GEN	1	13	atlh	translate-ordinal	י֥וֹם שְׁלִישִֽׁי	1	the third day.	“{and that was} {the end of} the third day.” or “{and} the third day {ended}.” or “{and that was} {the end of} day three.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
GEN	1	14	qyuo	writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֗ים	1	Then God said,	“Then God commanded,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])

These lights refer to the sun, moon and stars that give off light. But it is important to keep this general in your translation (like the Hebrew text does) and not specify the names of these lights.
GEN	1	14	nvct		בִּ⁠רְקִ֣יעַ הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֔יִם	1	in the expanse of the heavens	“in the expanse/space of/called the heavens/sky” or “in the open space of the heavens/sky” or “in the heavens/sky”. The expanse is the same thing as the heavens (verse 8), so some translations leave “the expanse of” implied here. Do what is best in your language.
GEN	1	14	wj1r		לְ⁠הַבְדִּ֕יל	1	to separate	“to divide/distinguish” or “that separate/divide”
GEN	1	14	omre		בֵּ֥ין הַ⁠יּ֖וֹם וּ⁠בֵ֣ין הַ⁠לָּ֑יְלָה	1	between the day and the night.	“the day{time} from the night{time}.” See how you translated “Day{time}” and “Night{time}” in verse 5.
GEN	1	14	emar		וְ⁠הָי֤וּ לְ⁠אֹתֹת֙	1	And let them be for	“Let those lights/lamps also be” or “They must/will also serve/function as” or “I also command those lights/lamps to serve/function as”
GEN	1	14	gj2i		לְ⁠אֹתֹת֙ וּ⁠לְ⁠מ֣וֹעֲדִ֔ים	1	signs, and for	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) “signs/markers {of special/important events}, and {they must/will} mark” or “mark/indicate when important things happen, and {they must/will} mark” (2) “signs/markers that mark/indicate/show”. The word “signs” means that the lights can mark certain times of the year. Following the first interpretation, the lights are to also mark special events (such as the star that signaled Jesus’ birth and the darkened sun at Jesus’ death).
GEN	1	14	l0rn		וּ⁠לְ⁠מ֣וֹעֲדִ֔ים וּ⁠לְ⁠יָמִ֖ים וְ⁠שָׁנִֽים	1	seasons, and for days and years.	“seasons, days and years.” or “when seasons, days and years begin {and end}.” The sun and moon show the passing of time. For example, the 30-day month is determined by the phases of the moon, and the 365-day year is determined by the time it takes for the earth to travel around the sun. Seasons are regular times of the year, such as seed-planting and harvesting times, and the seasons of spring, summer, fall and winter (Genesis 8:22), as well as the special festivals which God appointed for his people to meet with him. You could put some of that information in a footnote.

Make sure your translation of these verses does not sound like he created the lights twice. See how you translated “So God made” in verse 7.
GEN	1	16	gil5		אֶת שְׁנֵ֥י הַ⁠מְּאֹרֹ֖ת הַ⁠גְּדֹלִ֑ים	1	the two great lights,	“the two bright/big lights,” This phrase refers to the sun and the moon, which are the two brightest objects in the earth’s sky. However the author intentionally does not use their names, so you should not include their names in your translation either.
GEN	1	16	vrxb		אֶת הַ⁠מָּא֤וֹר הַ⁠גָּדֹל֙	1	the greater light	“the stronger/brighter light”. The focus is on the relative brightness or strength of the lights, not on their size.
GEN	1	16	u789	figs-personification	לְ⁠מֶמְשֶׁ֣לֶת הַ⁠יּ֔וֹם	1	to rule the day,	“to dominate/govern the day,” or “to shine during the day,” The word “rule” is a figure of speech that means each light has the greatest effect during a particular time period because it is the brightest light that is shining then. For some languages, nonliving objects like the sun and the moon cannot “rule” because only people can do that. Do what is accurate and natural in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

The Hebrew word for “birds” can also be more general and refer to “winged/flying creatures,” which includes birds, bats, flying insects and even flying reptiles that are now extinct. Consider whether it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

For example, whales always give birth to whales, and never give birth to cats or cows, or any other kind of creature.
GEN	1	21	m9c6		וְ⁠אֵ֣ת	2	and	“and {how he created/made}” or “{That is} also {how he created/made}”. For some languages it is more natural to begin a new sentence here, so that the previous sentence is not too long. Do what is best in your language.

GEN	1	22	o4ix	figs-explicit	לֵ⁠אמֹ֑ר	1	saying,	“by saying {to them},” or “and said {first to the water animals},” God blesses the water animals first. If that is not clear, you could make that explicit here in the quote margin or at the beginning of what God says. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	1	22	i0z3	figs-123person	פְּר֣וּ	1	“Be fruitful	“Reproduce” or “You water animals must/will produce/have many babies/young”. God speaks directly to the water animals using the second person (“you”), then later in the verse speaks about the birds in the third person (“the birds”). For some languages it is necessary to use either second person for both or third person for both, to prevent confusion. Do what is natural and clear in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
GEN	1	22	nlue	grammar-connect-logic-goal	וּ⁠רְב֗וּ	1	and multiply	“so that you {and your offspring/descendants} {will} multiply/increase {greatly} {in number}” or “so that you {and your offspring/descendants} {will} become {very} numerous/many” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])

GEN	1	22	l6p3		וְ⁠הָ⁠ע֖וֹף יִ֥רֶב	1	and let the bird{s}	“And the birds must/will {also}” or “{You} birds must/will {also}”. Consider whether it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

GEN	1	24	i79m		לְ⁠מִינָ֔⁠הּ	1	according to its kind:	“{each} that bears/has its own kind/type of offspring/young,” or “{each} bearing/having its own kind/type of offspring/young,” This phrase means that every kind of animal that God created always produces young that are the same kind of animal as their parents. See how you translated this phrase in verse 21, and see the note about that there.
GEN	1	24	qqtv		בְּהֵמָ֥ה	1	livestock	“{including} domestic/farm/tame animals,” This term probably includes animals such as horses, camels, cattle, sheep and goats that people raise for food or use for farming or other work. This is in contrast to animals that normally live in the wild.

It may be necessary to translate this phrase in different ways, depending on the context.
GEN	1	25	r9t0		וַ⁠יַּ֥רְא אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	And God saw	“And he saw/observed” or “God/He saw/observed”

Consider again how you translated “And God saw that...good” in verses 10, 12, 18, 21, 25. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	1	26	jm19	writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	Then God said,	“Then God said {to himself},” Here God is not commanding anything to happen, but is getting ready to personally create mankind himself (the details are given in Gen 2:7, 21-22). Some languages have to specify who is being spoken to. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	1	26	z09u		נַֽעֲשֶׂ֥ה	1	“Let us make	“{Now} we should/will make/create”. Most Bible scholars think that the plural pronouns (“us”, “our”) in this verse refer to God and reflect the fact that he is three Persons in one God. So it is best to keep these pronouns plural in your translation. Also, many translations capitalize the first letter of all pronouns that refer to God in order to show him honor and respect. Your translation team needs to decide whether or not you will do that, too. Be consistent with your decision as you translate the Bible.
GEN	1	26	ii2k		אָדָ֛ם	1	man	“mankind/humankind” or “human beings”. The Hebrew word for “man” is used here (and in verse 27) as a collective noun that refers to human beings in general, including male and female.
GEN	1	26	uhrv	figs-doublet	בְּ⁠צַלְמֵ֖⁠נוּ כִּ⁠דְמוּתֵ֑⁠נוּ	1	in our image, according to our likeness,	“to be like us and act like us,” or “to be like us, so that they are similar to us in many ways,” These two phrases have similar meanings and emphasize that God made mankind to be like himself in many ways. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
GEN	1	26	kmqm		וְ⁠יִרְדּוּ֩ בִ⁠דְגַ֨ת	1	and let them rule over	“and let us put them in charge of” or “We will give them authority to rule/oversee/manage”

GEN	1	26	dpf3		וּ⁠בְ⁠ע֣וֹף הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֗יִם	1	and over the bird{s} of the sky	“the birds {that fly} in the sky/air,” Some translations leave out the phrase “of the sky” because it is strongly implied and may not sound natural in their languages. However, if it is natural in your language, it is best to include this phrase, because the author repeatedly contrasts three large categories of animals in this section: creatures that live on the ground, creatures that swim in the water, and creatures that fly in the sky.
GEN	1	26	g9ww		וּ⁠בַ⁠בְּהֵמָה֙	1	and over the livestock	“the domestic/farm/tame animals,” Consider again how you translated “livestock” in verses 24-26.
GEN	1	26	ubtn		וּ⁠בְ⁠כָל הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	and over all the earth	“and the entire earth,” This refers to the planet earth and everything on it, including water, soil, metals, minerals and other resources, as well as all the plants and animals.
GEN	1	26	wieg		וּ⁠בְ⁠כָל הָ⁠רֶ֖מֶשׂ הָֽ⁠רֹמֵ֥שׂ עַל הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	and over every moving creature moving on the earth.”	“including every creature/animal that moves/lives on the earth.” or “and/including all the creatures/animals that move/live on the earth.” For some languages it is not natural to repeat “and” or “over” with each item in this list. Consider the best way to translate a list like this in your language.
GEN	1	27	n1j0	grammar-connect-words-phrases	וַ⁠יִּבְרָ֨א אֱלֹהִ֤ים	1	Then God created	“So God created/made”. In this verse God does what he said he was going to do (verse 26). Make sure your translation does not sound like God created mankind twice. Also see how you translated “created” in verses 1 and 21. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
GEN	1	27	cfj6	translate-key-terms	אֶת הָֽ⁠אָדָם֙	1	man	“mankind/humankind” or “human beings”. Be consistent here with how you translated this term in verse 26. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms]])
GEN	1	27	cein		בְּ⁠צַלְמ֔⁠וֹ	1	in his image.	“in his own image.” or “to be like himself.” or “to be similar to himself {in many ways}.” God made mankind to be like himself in some ways (not all ways) and to represent him in the world and show people what he is like. For example, God gave human beings an eternal spirit and the ability to have a relationship with him. He also gave us emotions, an understanding of right and wrong, and the ability to reason and make choices, to create new things and to have authority over the rest of creation. You could include some of that information in a footnote.
GEN	1	27	lpav	figs-parallelism	בְּ⁠צֶ֥לֶם אֱלֹהִ֖ים בָּרָ֣א אֹת֑⁠וֹ	1	In the image of God he created him;	“{Yes/Indeed,} he created/made them in his image” or “{Indeed} God/he created/made them to be like himself” or “{Yes,} God/he created/made them to be similar to himself {in many ways}”. The pronoun “him” refers to the collective noun “man”, which in this case refers to human beings in general, not just one person. Also, this clause is the second half of a chiasm (an inverted parallelism) that repeats the first part of verse 27 in reverse order, to emphasize that it was in God’s image that human beings were created. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
GEN	1	27	homf	figs-figs-infostructure	זָכָ֥ר וּ⁠נְקֵבָ֖ה בָּרָ֥א אֹתָֽ⁠ם	1	male and female he created them.	“He {also} created/made them {to be} male or female.” The phrase “male and female” comes first in the Hebrew text in order to emphasize it. Do what is accurate and natural in your language. Also make sure your translation of this verse does not sound like God is both male and female. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-figs-infostructure]])
GEN	1	28	y4rr		וַ⁠יְבָ֣רֶךְ אֹתָ⁠ם֮ אֱלֹהִים֒	1	Then God blessed them	“Then God showed his favor to them” or “Then God caused them to prosper/flourish”. See how you translated “blessed” in verse 22.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	1	28	rbqr		פְּר֥וּ	1	“Be fruitful	“Bear/Have many children” or “You will bear/have many children”. See how you translated “Be fruitful and multiply” in verse 22. It may be necessary to translate the phrase in different ways, depending on the context.

GEN	1	28	bycn		וּ⁠בְ⁠כָל חַיָּ֖ה הָֽ⁠רֹמֶ֥שֶׂת עַל הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”	“and every creature/animal that moves/lives on the earth/land.” or “and all the creatures/animals that move/live on the earth/land.” This phrase refers generally here to every kind of creature that lives on land.
GEN	1	29	so4h	writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֗ים	1	Then God said,	“Then God/he {also} said {to them},” or “Then God/he continued/added,” God is still speaking to the human beings, so it may be necessary to add “also” to this quote margin. Some languages need to specify who is being spoken to. Other languages may leave this quote margin implied, since the same subject (God) is talking to the same people. However the repeated quote margin in the Hebrew text could show that God paused before continuing or that he is changing the topic, or to emphasize what he says next. So if it is natural to keep the quote margin here in your language, that is best. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	1	29	myop	translate-key-terms	הִנֵּה֩	1	“Behold,	“Look/Listen,” or “Listen to this,” or “I want you to know that”. This word means that what God says next is important and should be given special attention. Consider the best way to translate this term in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms]])

See how you translated a similar phrase in verses 11 and 12.

Also see how you translated “plant” in verses 11, 12, 29. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	1	30	lpnz		וַֽ⁠יְהִי כֵֽן	1	And it was so.	“And that is how it was.” or “And it/everything was {exactly} as he/God said {it should/would be}.” Consider again how you translated this sentence in verses 7, 9, 11, 15, 24 and 30. It may be necessary to translate it differently, depending on the context. For example, here in verse 30 this phrase follows a statement God made, which is different from the other contexts where it follows a command.
GEN	1	31	l4cr		וַ⁠יַּ֤רְא אֱלֹהִים֙	1	Then God saw	“Then God observed/considered” or “Then God looked at”. See how you translated “God saw the light” in verse 4.
GEN	1	31	ptfk		אֶת כָּל אֲשֶׁ֣ר עָשָׂ֔ה	1	all that he had made,	“everything that he had made/created,” This refers to everything that God made during the entire week of Creation, not just on the sixth day. Consider again how you translated “made” (or “make”) in verses 7, 16, 25, 26 and 31. Compare that to how you translated a word that has a similar meaning (“created”) in verses 1, 21 and 27.
GEN	1	31	tha1		וְ⁠הִנֵּה	1	and behold,	“and indeed” or “and he saw/observed that”. This word calls attention to what God is looking at and helps emphasize that what he saw was very good.
GEN	1	31	v8u8		ט֖וֹב מְאֹ֑ד	0	it was very good.	“it was {all} very good/excellent.” Consider again how you translated “good/excellent” in verses 4, 10, 12, 18, 21, 25 and 31.
GEN	1	31	a62e		וַֽ⁠יְהִי עֶ֥רֶב וַֽ⁠יְהִי בֹ֖קֶר	1	Then there was evening, and there was morning,	“Then evening came and {then/later} morning came,” Consider again how you translated these phrases in verses 5, 8, 13, 19, 23 and 31, and see the note about that at verse 5.
GEN	1	31	e107	translate-ordinal	י֥וֹם הַ⁠שִּׁשִּֽׁי	1	the sixth day.	“{and that was} {the end of} the sixth day.” or “and the sixth day ended.” or “{and that was} {the end of} day six.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
GEN	2	1	gwb3	figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יְכֻלּ֛וּ הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֥יִם וְ⁠הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ	1	So the heavens and the earth were completed,	“So {it was that} the heavens and the earth were completed/finished {by God},” or “That is how {God} finished {creating/making} the heavens and the earth,” Verse one is a summary statement that looks back at what God did in chapter one. Make sure that is clear in your language. Also consider whether it is better in your language to use an active or passive clause here, and see how you translated “heavens and earth” in Gen 1:1. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
GEN	2	1	wx40		וְ⁠כָל צְבָאָֽ⁠ם	1	and all their hosts.	“including all the many things that are in them.” or “along with everything in them.” This phrase refers to everything in the heavens and on the earth that God had created, as described in chapter one.
GEN	2	2	veae	translate-ordinal	וַ⁠יְכַ֤ל בַּ⁠יּ֣וֹם הַ⁠שְּׁבִיעִ֔י	1	And by the seventh day	“By the seventh day” or “By day seven”. Make sure it is clear in your translation that God had completed his work by the seventh day and did not work on that day. Also consider again how you translated ordinal numbers in Gen 1:5, 8, 13, 19, 23, 31; 2:2. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal]])
GEN	2	2	axly	writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יְכַ֤ל אֱלֹהִים֙	1	God had completed	“God/he had completed/finished” or “God/he was finished with”. Decide whether it is better in your language to refer to God with a title (“God”) or a pronoun (“he”) in this context. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	2	2	g8od		מְלַאכְתּ֖⁠וֹ אֲשֶׁ֣ר עָשָׂ֑ה	1	his work that he had done,	“his/the work he had been doing,”
GEN	2	2	ki88		וַ⁠יִּשְׁבֹּת֙ בַּ⁠יּ֣וֹם הַ⁠שְּׁבִיעִ֔י מִ⁠כָּל	1	so he rested on the seventh day from all	“so he rested/ceased on that day from all” or “so on the seventh day he no longer did”. God “rested” in the sense that he stopped his work and did not work on that day. It does not mean he was tired or had lost his strength. Rest is an important theme in the Bible, so you should try to be consistent in how you translate this term here and in other passages such as Exodus 23:12, 31:17 and Hebrews 4:4, 10. Part of this theme includes the Hebrew word for “Sabbath” which has the same root word as the verb for “rest” and is often translated “resting day”.
GEN	2	2	yjww		מְלַאכְתּ֖⁠וֹ אֲשֶׁ֣ר עָשָׂ֑ה	1	his work that he had done.	“the work that he had been doing.” or “that work.”
GEN	2	3	ads6	grammar-connect-words-phrases	וַ⁠יְבָ֤רֶךְ אֱלֹהִים֙	1	And God	“Then God/he” or “God/He”. For some languages it is more natural to begin verse 3 without a conjunction. Other languages use a conjunction here like Hebrew does. Do what is natural in your language.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
GEN	2	3	cbfo		וַ⁠יְבָ֤רֶךְ אֶת י֣וֹם הַ⁠שְּׁבִיעִ֔י	1	blessed the seventh day	“established/designated the seventh day {as a day} to bless {people}” or “honored the seventh day”

GEN	2	3	mitp		כִּ֣י ב֤⁠וֹ	1	because on it	“because on/during that day” or “{He did that} because on/during that day”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
GEN	2	3	yw74		שָׁבַת֙ מִ⁠כָּל מְלַאכְתּ֔⁠וֹ	1	he rested from all his work	“he ceased from all his/the work” or “he did not do any more work” or “he no longer did the work”. See how you translated a similar clause in verse 2.
GEN	2	3	ix8r	writing-pronouns	אֲשֶׁר בָּרָ֥א אֱלֹהִ֖ים לַ⁠עֲשֽׂוֹת	1	of creating that God had done.	“of creating that he had been doing.” or “that he had been doing, creating {everything}.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	2	4	t7b8		אֵ֣לֶּה	1	These {are}	“These {are more details about}” or “This {is more about}” or “What follows {gives/tells more details about}”. This phrase refers forward to Gen 2:5-24 and begins a new section. Chapter one of Genesis gives an overview of what God did each day of creation week, including that he created human beings on day six. Chapter two gives more details about how God created Adam and Eve, who were his most important creations. Each chapter emphasizes different parts of the same history; they are not two different histories. Make sure that is clear in your translation.
GEN	2	4	hei1	figs-activepassive	תוֹלְד֧וֹת הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֛יִם וְ⁠הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ בְּ⁠הִבָּֽרְאָ֑⁠ם	1	the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created,	“the history of the heavens and the earth when they were created {by God},” or “what happened when {God} created the heavens and the earth.” or “the history of what {God} did when he created the heavens and the earth:” The Hebrew text uses a passive construction here to emphasize the heavens and the earth. Decide the best way to do that in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
GEN	2	4	stlx		בְּ⁠י֗וֹם עֲשׂ֛וֹת	1	in the day when	“during the days/time when” or “During the days/time when”. Consider whether or not it is clearer or more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here that continues into verse 5.
GEN	2	4	dggd	translate-key-terms	יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	Yahweh God	“Yahweh {who is} God” or “God {whose name is} Yahweh”. This phrase is a combination of God’s personal name “Yahweh” with his title “God”. Both are used together when he is especially in focus. This pattern of using a personal name and a title together is also used for people in the Old Testament when they are being emphasized, for example, “Ahab king of Israel” and “Ruth the Moabite”. Many translations have “LORD God” in place of “Yahweh God” throughout the Old Testament. This follows the Jewish custom of substituting the Hebrew title “Adonai” (which means “my Lord”) for “Yahweh” (which means “he is”) when they read the Scriptures aloud. More recently, translation teams are putting “Yahweh” back in the Bible text (especially in the Old Testament, but also in the New Testament), and they include a footnote to explain the term. (Some translation teams consider using “Jehovah” instead of “Yahweh”. However that is not a name from the Bible, but is formed by taking the consonants from “Yahweh” and combining them with the vowels from “Adonai”.) (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms]])
GEN	2	4	avz9	figs-chiasm	עֲשׂ֛וֹת אֶ֥רֶץ וְ⁠שָׁמָֽיִם	1	made the earth and the heavens,	“made/created the earth and the heavens”. This clause forms a chiasm with “the heavens and the earth...created” in the first part of this verse. Try to keep the same phrase order in your translation. See how you translated “the heavens” and “the earth” in Gen 1:1 and 2:1. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-chiasm]])
GEN	2	5	ryqb	grammar-connect-time-background	וְ⁠כֹ֣ל	1	and	“And/Now {for a while,}” or “{For a while,}” or “{for a while,}” Consider whether it is better in your translation to begin a new sentence here or continue the sentence from the end of verse 4. Verses 5-6 give background information about what things were like before God created mankind (verse 7). Some languages use a conjunction like “Now” to introduce background information, while other languages do not use a conjunction. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
GEN	2	5	hsz0		וְ⁠כֹ֣ל שִׂ֣יחַ הַ⁠שָּׂדֶ֗ה טֶ֚רֶם יִֽהְיֶ֣ה בָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	every shrub of the field had not yet appeared on the earth,	“there were not yet any shrubs/bushes {growing} in the fields on the earth,” or “no wild shrubs/bushes had started growing on the earth yet,”
GEN	2	5	f6lk		וְ⁠כָל עֵ֥שֶׂב הַ⁠שָּׂדֶ֖ה טֶ֣רֶם יִצְמָ֑ח	1	and every plant of the field had not yet sprung up,	“nor had any {other} plants started growing yet,” or “and there were not any {other} plants that had sprouted yet,” See how you translated “plants” in Gen 1:11-12, 29-30.
GEN	2	5	jw7n	writing-pronouns	כִּי֩ יְהוָ֤ה אֱלֹהִים֙	1	because Yahweh God	“because Yahweh/he” or “{That was} because God”. The Hebrew text repeats “Yahweh God” frequently in chapter 2 (starting in verse 4) to emphasize God. For some languages, it is not natural to repeat “Yahweh God” so often in the same paragraph, and it could even give the wrong meaning that there was more than one Yahweh God. For languages like that, it may be best to use “Yahweh God” only once at the beginning of a section or paragraph, then use “Yahweh”, “God”, or “he” in the rest of the section, depending on the context. Consider what is the most accurate and natural way to refer to Yahweh God at each point in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	2	5	uyzs		לֹ֨א הִמְטִ֜יר עַל הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	had not caused it to rain on the earth,	“had not {yet} caused it to rain on the earth,” or “had not {yet} sent/caused rain to water the earth,” See how you translated “earth” in Gen 1:1 and 2:1.
GEN	2	5	d613		וְ⁠אָדָ֣ם אַ֔יִן	1	and there was no man	“and there were no human beings {yet}” or “and mankind/humans did not exist {yet}”
GEN	2	5	wkdc		לַֽ⁠עֲבֹ֖ד אֶת הָֽ⁠אֲדָמָֽה	1	to work the ground.	“to cultivate/farm the land/soil.” Working the ground includes tasks such as clearing the ground, preparing the soil, planting seeds, and watering the plants. See how you translated “ground” in Gen 1:25. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.
GEN	2	6	sm5l	grammar-connect-phrases-words	וְ⁠אֵ֖ד	1	But mist	“But {during/at that time} mist/water/groundwater” or “{During/At that time} mist/springs”. The Hebrew word for “mist” refers to water in some form, such as water vapor, springs, or streams of water. Also, some translations begin verse 6 without “But”. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-phrases-words]])
GEN	2	6	unhf		יַֽעֲלֶ֣ה	1	came up	“seeped up” or “kept coming/seeping up” or “would come/seep up”. This verb describes a repeated or continuous action.
GEN	2	6	ynrf		מִן הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	from the earth	“from the ground” or “from underground”
GEN	2	6	ah3z		וְ⁠הִשְׁקָ֖ה	1	and watered	“and irrigated” or “and spread over” or “supplied water to”
GEN	2	6	g9b6		אֶֽת כָּל פְּנֵֽי הָֽ⁠אֲדָמָֽה	1	all of the surface of the ground.	“the entire/whole surface of the land/earth.” or “the ground everywhere.”
GEN	2	7	f1n1		וַ⁠יִּיצֶר֩ יְהוָ֨ה אֱלֹהִ֜ים	1	Then Yahweh God	“Then Yahweh {who is} God”. The phrase “Yahweh God” is used here to emphasize that he is the one who created mankind. So it is best to keep that here in your translation, unless that would communicate wrong meaning. See how you translated this phrase in Gen 2:4-5.
GEN	2	7	wm4v		וַ⁠יִּיצֶר֩	1	formed	“shaped” or “crafted”. This word describes what an expert craftsmen would do, and implies artistic skills and design.
GEN	2	7	cx5u		אֶת הָֽ⁠אָדָ֗ם	1	the man	“a man” or “the {first} man”. The definite article “the” is used here because this refers to a specific man, the first male human. For many languages it is more natural to use an indefinite article (“a”) to introduce him here, or to not use an article at all. Do what is best in your language.
GEN	2	7	m006		עָפָר֙	1	{out of} dust	“{out of} dirt/mud/clay”. The word used here in the Hebrew text is usually translated “dust” (as in Gen 13:16, 28:14), but it can also be translated “dirt” (as in Gen 26:15) or “mortar/mud/clay” (as in Leviticus 14:42). The dirt would have been damp enough to be formed or shaped.
GEN	2	7	b0tz		מִן הָ֣⁠אֲדָמָ֔ה	1	from the ground,	“from the earth,” See how you translated “ground” in Gen 1:25 and 2:5-6. You may need to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.
GEN	2	7	dd25		וַ⁠יִּפַּ֥ח	1	and he breathed	“and he/Yahweh blew/exhaled” or “Then he/Yahweh blew/exhaled”. For some languages, it is more natural to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language.
GEN	2	7	x2lp	writing-pronouns	בְּ⁠אַפָּ֖י⁠ו נִשְׁמַ֣ת חַיִּ֑ים	1	into his nostrils the breath of life,	“into the man’s nostrils/nose the/his breath that would make him live,” or “his breath into the man’s nostrils/nose to make him live,” This refers to God’s breath. As you translate the pronouns “he” and “his” in this verse, make sure it is clear in your language who is being referred to. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	2	7	sab3	writing-pronouns	וַֽ⁠יְהִ֥י הָֽ⁠אָדָ֖ם	1	and the man	“so that he” or “and then the man”. Consider what is the most natural way in your language to refer to the man throughout verse 7. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	2	7	u3xe		וַֽ⁠יְהִ֥י לְ⁠נֶ֥פֶשׁ חַיָּֽה	1	became a living being.	“became a living person.” or “became alive.” or “came to life.” or “started to live.”
GEN	2	8	uq6f	writing-background	וַ⁠יִּטַּ֞ע יְהוָ֧ה אֱלֹהִ֛ים	1	Now Yahweh God had planted	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean (1) “Now Yahweh God had {previously/already} planted” or “{Before that,} Yahweh God had planted”. This interpretation fits the context of chapter one, which says that God had made all the trees and plants on day three (Gen 1:11-12), three days before he created man (Gen 1:26-27; 2:7). Following this view, verses 8-14 give background information for what happens in verses 15-24. (2) “Then Yahweh God planted”. According to this interpretation, God made the Garden of Eden on day six after he created man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
GEN	2	8	fkyu		גַּן	1	a garden	“a {large} garden” or “a {large} farm/park”. The man lived in this garden and there were animals and many trees and other plants in it too, so it was fairly large. Make sure your translation of this term does not refer to something that is too small.
GEN	2	8	lrc1		בְ⁠עֵ֖דֶן מִ⁠קֶּ֑דֶם	1	in Eden, in the east,	“in {the land/region of/called} Eden, {which was} in/to the east,” or “in the eastern part of {the land/region of/called} Eden,” In this context, “in the east” can refer to (1) the eastern part of the region of Eden (2) a region east of where Moses lived when he wrote this. It is best, if possible, to keep your translation of this phrase general here (like the Hebrew text).
GEN	2	8	b4l5		וַ⁠יָּ֣שֶׂם שָׁ֔ם אֶת הָֽ⁠אָדָ֖ם	1	and there he put the man	“and that is where he put the man” or “and in that garden he put the man” or “That is where he put the man”. Consider whether it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
GEN	2	8	g0j9		אֲשֶׁ֥ר יָצָֽר	1	whom he had formed.	“whom he had shaped/crafted.” or “whom he had created/made.” See how you translated “formed” in verse 7.
GEN	2	9	mhgj	writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יַּצְמַ֞ח יְהוָ֤ה אֱלֹהִים֙	1	And Yahweh God	“{There} Yahweh/he”. See how you translated “Yahweh God” in verse 5, and see the note about that there. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

See how you translated “every tree” in Gen 1:29.
GEN	2	9	p5bc		לְ⁠מַרְאֶ֖ה	1	to the sight	“to the eyes” or “to look at” or “in appearance”
GEN	2	9	zhd9		וְ⁠ט֣וֹב	1	and good	“and {that produce/have/grow fruit that is} good” or “and {whose fruit is} good

GEN	2	9	sd0q		וְ⁠עֵ֤ץ	2	and the tree	“along with the tree” or “as well as the tree”
GEN	2	9	u5rw	translate-key-terms	וְ⁠עֵ֕ץ הַ⁠דַּ֖עַת ט֥וֹב וָ⁠רָֽע	1	of the knowledge of good and evil.	“whose fruit enables people to know/discern {what is} good/right and {what is} evil/wrong.” The word “good” refers here to all that is morally right and pleasing to God, and “evil” refers to what is morally wrong and against his will. Keep that in mind as you translate these terms. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms]])
GEN	2	10	voiu	grammar-connect-words-phrases	וְ⁠נָהָרּ֙ יֹצֵ֣א	1	And a river was going out	“Now a river was flowing” or “A river was flowing” or “There was a river flowing”. Verse 10 gives more background information that began in verse 8. Many translations omit the conjunction “And” or “Now” here. Do what is best in your language.

GEN	2	10	pkye		מֵ⁠עֵ֔דֶן	1	from Eden	“from/through {the land/region of} Eden”. The garden was inside the land of Eden, so as the river flowed through Eden, it watered the garden.
GEN	2	10	yrvc		לְ⁠הַשְׁק֖וֹת	1	to water	”to irrigate” or “to provide water for” or “that watered/irrigated” or “that provided water for”. See how you translated “watered” in verse 6.
GEN	2	10	ljlc		אֶת הַ⁠גָּ֑ן	1	the garden,	“the farm/park,” See how you translated this phrase in verse 8.
GEN	2	10	t8sf		וּ⁠מִ⁠שָּׁם֙	1	and from there	“and from the garden” or “From there/Eden”. For some languages it is better to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language.
GEN	2	10	fqui		NO OrigLQuote AVAILABLE!!!	0	it divided and became four head{water}s.	Verse 10 is ambiguous in the Hebrew text. It could mean (1) “the/that river divided into four {smaller} waters/rivers.” This interpretation means that the river in Eden was the source river that watered the garden and then divided downstream into the four smaller rivers. (2) “there were four {smaller} source rivers that joined together and formed the larger river.” This interpretation means that the four rivers were source headwaters that flowed downstream and joined to form the larger river in Eden. If possible, leave your translation ambiguous here (like the Hebrew text does), so that either interpretation is possible.
GEN	2	11	sxd9		שֵׁ֥ם הָֽ⁠אֶחָ֖ד פִּישׁ֑וֹן	1	The name of the first {is}	“The name of the first {river} {is/was}” or “The first {river} is/was named/called” or “The first {river} is/was”. Most translations use past tense in verse 10, but then use present tense throughout verses 11-14. It may be best to use past tense throughout verses 10-14, especially since the rivers and places that are named in these verses no longer existed when Genesis was written, because the Flood completely changed the entire surface of the earth; after the Flood, the names of some of those rivers and places were given to new rivers and places.
GEN	2	11	i1m0	translate-names	פִּישׁ֑וֹן	1	Pishon.	“the Pishon {River}.” Consider whether or not it is natural in your language to use the article (“the”) with the name of a river. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
GEN	2	11	xpf8		ה֣וּא הַ⁠סֹּבֵ֗ב	1	It winds through	“It meanders/meandered through” or “which flows/flowed around through”. The word “winds” or “meanders” means that the river changed direction from time to time. Consider whether it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here, or to continue the previous sentence.
GEN	2	11	oq6y	translate-names	אֵ֚ת כָּל אֶ֣רֶץ הַֽ⁠חֲוִילָ֔ה	1	all of the land of Havilah,	“the entire/whole region of/called Havilah,” Be consistent in how you translate “land of” throughout this section. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
GEN	2	11	f2br		אֲשֶׁר שָׁ֖ם הַ⁠זָּהָֽב	1	where gold {is}.	“{a place} where {there is/was} {much} gold.” or “which has/had {a lot of} gold.”
GEN	2	12	kg7u		וּֽ⁠זֲהַ֛ב הָ⁠אָ֥רֶץ הַ⁠הִ֖וא	1	And the gold of that land	“In fact, the gold from that land/region” or “Indeed, the gold {that is found} in that land/region”. This sentence emphasizes the previous statement about the gold, and gives more information about it.
GEN	2	12	qr6f		ט֑וֹב	1	{is} good.	“{is/was} {very} pure.” or “{is/was} {very} high quality.”
GEN	2	12	thih	translate-unknown	הַ⁠בְּדֹ֖לַח	1	Bdellium	“{A kind/type of fragrant/sweet-smelling resin called} bdellium” or “A {kind/type of} fragrant/sweet-smelling resin/perfume”. The meaning of this Hebrew word is not certain. In many translations it is transliterated, that is, spelled the way the Hebrew word is pronounced. It may refer to (1) a fragrant/sweet-smelling tree resin that was used to make perfume; (2) a type of stone or crystal, or possibly pearl. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
GEN	2	12	rgru	translate-unknown	וְ⁠אֶ֥בֶן הַ⁠שֹּֽׁהַם	1	and onyx stone	“and {valuable} onyx gemstones” or “and {valuable} stones/gemstones called onyx” or “and {valuable} gemstones”. It is not certain what kind of stone this was, but most Bible scholars think it was onyx, which is a kind of quartz that is often black, but also occurs in many other colors, and can have stripes or bands of white (or other colors) running through it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
GEN	2	12	q3cf		שָׁ֥ם	1	{are} there.	“{are/were} {also} {found} there.” or “{are/were} {also} in that land/region.” Make sure the verb tense you choose here fits with the way you translated verse 11.
GEN	2	13	trdk		וְ⁠שֵֽׁם הַ⁠נָּהָ֥ר הַ⁠שֵּׁנִ֖י גִּיח֑וֹן	1	And the name of the second river {is}	“The name of the second river {is/was}” or “The second river is/was named/called” or “The second river is/was” . See how you translated a similar phrase in verse 11.
GEN	2	13	hbu0		גִּיח֑וֹן	1	Gihon.	“the Gihon {River}.”
GEN	2	13	s0s0		ה֣וּא הַ⁠סּוֹבֵ֔ב	1	It winds through	“It meanders/meandered through” or “which flows/flowed around through”. Consider whether it is better here in your language to begin a new sentence or to continue the previous sentence. See how you translated this phrase in verse 11.
GEN	2	13	f6wb		אֵ֖ת כָּל אֶ֥רֶץ כּֽוּשׁ	1	all of the land of Cush.	“the entire/whole region of/called Cush.” See how you translated a similar phrase in verse 11.
GEN	2	14	nx0q		וְ⁠שֵׁ֨ם הַ⁠נָּהָ֤ר הַ⁠שְּׁלִישִׁי֙ חִדֶּ֔קֶל	1	And the name of the third river {is}	“The name of the third river {is/was}” or “The third river is/was named/called” or “The third river is/was”
GEN	2	14	e9ga		חִדֶּ֔קֶל	1	Tigris.	“the Tigris {River}.”
GEN	2	14	hou8		ה֥וּא הַֽ⁠הֹלֵ֖ךְ קִדְמַ֣ת	1	It goes east of	“It flows/flowed {in an area} east of” or “which flows/flowed {in an area} east of “ or “which was located east of”. The word “east” refers to where the river was located, not the direction it was flowing.
GEN	2	14	db4e	translate-names	אַשּׁ֑וּר	1	Asshur.	“{the land/region of/called} Asshur/Assyria.” This Hebrew name is pronounced “ash-shur” and is spelled “Asshur”, “Ashur”, or “Assyria” in English, depending on the context. This was a region of land, because at that time there were no cities. Most translations have “Assyria” here. Consider again how you translated “the land of” in verses 11 and 13. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
GEN	2	14	o7hl		וְ⁠הַ⁠נָּהָ֥ר הָֽ⁠רְבִיעִ֖י פְרָֽת	1	And the fourth river {is}	“{The name of} the fourth river {is/was}” or “The fourth river {is/was named/called}” or “and the fourth river {is/was}”. See how you translated a similar phrase in verses 11, 13-14. Also consider again whether it is best in your language to use present tense or past tense in verses 10-14.
GEN	2	14	m4x2		פְרָֽת	1	Euphrates.	“the Euphrates {River}.” Consider again how you translated the names of rivers in verses 11, 13-14.
GEN	2	15	p6is	writing-background	וַ⁠יִּקַּ֛ח יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהִ֖ים אֶת הָֽ⁠אָדָ֑ם וַ⁠יַּנִּחֵ֣⁠הוּ	1	And Yahweh God took the man and put him	“Now Yahweh God had {already} put the man” or “After Yahweh God put the man”. In verse 8 it says that God had already put the man in the garden, so the way you translate verse 15 should not sound like he did it again. This information is repeated here to continue the story from verse 8. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
GEN	2	15	qzwu	translate-names	בְ⁠גַן עֵ֔דֶן	1	in the Garden of Eden	“in the garden in {the land/region of/called} Eden” or “in Eden Garden”. Notice that “Garden” is capitalized when it is part of a name. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
GEN	2	15	mm3k		לְ⁠עָבְדָ֖⁠הּ	1	to work it	“to cultivate/farm it” or “so that he would cultivate/farm it”. See how you translated “work” in verse 5.
GEN	2	15	iqg0		וּ⁠לְ⁠שָׁמְרָֽ⁠הּ	1	and tend it.	“and maintain it.” or “and take care of it.”
GEN	2	16	i5bo	writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יְצַו֙ יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	Then Yahweh God	“Then Yahweh/he” or “he”. Consider whether it is better in your language here to begin a new sentence or to continue the sentence from verse 15. Also consider what is the best way to refer to “Yahweh God” here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	2	16	ksxu	writing-quotations	וַ⁠יְצַו֙ הָֽ⁠אָדָ֖ם לֵ⁠אמֹ֑ר	1	commanded the man, saying,	“commanded the man,” or “commanded him,” Consider what is the best way to translate this quote margin in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	2	16	jla1		מִ⁠כֹּ֥ל עֵֽץ הַ⁠גָּ֖ן אָכֹ֥ל תֹּאכֵֽל	1	“From every tree of the garden you may freely eat,	“You may eat as much {fruit} as you want {to eat} from every/any tree in the garden,” or “You are permitted to eat whatever fruit that you want {to eat} from every/any tree in the garden,”
GEN	2	17	y73y	grammar-connect-exceptions	וּ⁠מֵ⁠עֵ֗ץ לֹ֥א תֹאכַ֖ל	1	but you must not eat	“except you must not eat” or “except for one: you must not eat” or “Except I forbid you to eat”. Make sure it is clear in your translation that God is not contradicting himself here, but rather he is giving an exception to what he said in verse 16. Also consider whether it is better here in your language to continue the sentence from verse 16 or to begin a new sentence. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions]])
GEN	2	17	y2vf		וּ⁠מֵ⁠עֵ֗ץ	1	from the tree	“{any fruit} from the tree” or “{the fruit that grows} on the tree”
GEN	2	17	i4ay		וּ⁠מֵ⁠עֵ֗ץ הַ⁠דַּ֨עַת֙ ט֣וֹב וָ⁠רָ֔ע	1	of the knowledge of good and evil,	“whose fruit enables people to know/discern {what is} good/right and {what is} evil/wrong,” See how you translated this phrase in verse 9.
GEN	2	17	zz8f		כִּ֗י בְּ⁠י֛וֹם אֲכָלְ⁠ךָ֥ מִמֶּ֖⁠נּוּ	1	because on the day you eat from it	“because on the {same} day you eat {fruit} from that tree” or “because if you eat {any fruit} from that tree, on that {same} day” or “because as soon as you eat {fruit} from that tree”
GEN	2	17	j7ij		מ֥וֹת תָּמֽוּת	1	you will surely die.”	“you will certainly/definitely die.”

GEN	2	18	aj1e		לֹא ט֛וֹב הֱי֥וֹת הָֽ⁠אָדָ֖ם לְ⁠בַדּ֑⁠וֹ	0	“{It is} not good for the man to be alone.	“It is not good for the man to live alone.” or “It is not good that the man is alone.” or “It is not good for the man to live by himself.”
GEN	2	18	wmbu		אֶֽעֱשֶׂהּ	1	I will make	“{So} I will make/create”
GEN	2	18	tesh		לּ֥⁠וֹ עֵ֖זֶר כְּ⁠נֶגְדּֽ⁠וֹ	1	a suitable helper for him.”	“a helper/companion who is {just/exactly} right for him.” or “someone who is suitable/right for him and will help him.” or “a suitable companion to help him.”
GEN	2	19	gw9t	grammar-connect-time-background	וַ⁠יִּצֶר֩	1	Now	“Now {previously,}” or “Now {before that,}” or “{Before that,}” The first sentence of verse 19 is a flashback of what happened before the events in verses 15-18 (which were first recorded in Gen 1:20-21, 24-25). Consider the best way to begin this sentence in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
GEN	2	19	wwu0	writing-pronouns	יְהוָ֨ה אֱלֹהִ֜ים	1	Yahweh God	“Yahweh“ or “he”. Consider whether it is better in your language to use a noun phrase (“Yahweh God” or “Yahweh”) or a pronoun (“he”) here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	2	19	d4rb	writing-background	וַ⁠יִּצֶר֩ מִן הָֽ⁠אֲדָמָ֗ה	1	had formed from the ground	“had formed/shaped {out of some dust/dirt} from the ground” or “had used {dust/dirt} from the ground to form/shape”. Translate this phrase in a way that makes it clear that this is background information that had already happened. Also see how you translated “formed” in verses 7-8 and “dust from the ground” in verse 7. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
GEN	2	19	anyc		כָּל חַיַּ֤ת הַ⁠שָּׂדֶה֙	1	every living thing of the field	“every {kind/type of} creature/animal that lives in the fields/wild” or “all {the different kinds/types of} animals that live in the fields” or “all {the different kinds/types of} wild animals”. Consider how you translated a similar phrase (“every living creature of the earth”) in Gen 1:24, 30.
GEN	2	19	f1wv		וְ⁠אֵת֙ כָּל ע֣וֹף הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֔יִם	1	and every bird of the sky.	“and every {kind/type of} bird {that flies} in the sky.” or “and all {the different kinds/types of} birds {that fly} in the sky.” See how you translated this phrase in Gen 1:30.
GEN	2	19	ips7	figs-go	וַ⁠יָּבֵא֙	1	So he brought them	“So/Then he brought/took them {all}”. This sentence continues the storyline. Consider how your language continues a story after giving background information. Also consider whether “brought” or “took” fits best here in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
GEN	2	19	liqn	translate-names	אֶל הָ֣⁠אָדָ֔ם	1	to the man	“to Adam”. Every translation team needs to decide when to use Adam’s name for the first time in the book of Genesis. The Hebrew word “adam” means “man” and is also Adam’s name; the choice that is not followed here in your translation could be put in a footnote. Some translations first use Adam’s name here in verse 19, when he is naming the animals. Many translations start using his name at the end of verse 20. Still other translations wait until 3:20 when he names Eve, and a few other translations begin in 3:9, 17 or 21. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
GEN	2	19	mv3h		לִ⁠רְא֖וֹת	1	to see	“to watch/hear” or “to find out”
GEN	2	19	ywtr		מַה יִּקְרָא ל֑⁠וֹ	1	what he would call them,	“what he would name each one,” or “what names he would give/assign to them,” These names were labels for what kind of animals they were, such as “dog” or “horse”, not personal names like “David” or “Mary”.
GEN	2	19	rleo		וְ⁠כֹל֩ אֲשֶׁ֨ר יִקְרָא ל֧⁠וֹ הָֽ⁠אָדָ֛ם	1	and whatever the man called	“and whatever Adam called/named” or “Whatever name the man gave/assigned to”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

Also see how you translated “a suitable helper” in verse 18. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
GEN	2	21	mb78	figs-idiom	וַ⁠יַּפֵּל֩ יְהוָ֨ה אֱלֹהִ֧ים תַּרְדֵּמָ֛ה עַל הָ⁠אָדָ֖ם	1	So Yahweh God caused a deep sleep to fall on the man.	“So/Then Yahweh God caused the man to fall/go into a deep/sound sleep.” or “So/Then Yahweh God caused the man to sleep {very} deeply/soundly.” Many languages have a similar idiom for “caused a deep sleep to fall on” that works well here. Consider what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	2	21	rhe7	writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּישָׁ֑ן	1	And {while} he was sleeping,	“Then {while} the man was sleeping/asleep,” Consider whether it is best in your language to use a pronoun or a noun here to refer to the man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	2	21	fkfa	writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּקַּ֗ח	1	then he took	“he/God took {out}”. Consider whether to use a pronoun or noun here to refer to God. Make sure it is clear in your translation who is being referred to at each point in this verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	2	21	j81y		אַחַת֙ מִ⁠צַּלְעֹתָ֔י⁠ו	1	one of his ribs	This phrase is ambiguous in the Hebrew text. It could mean (1) “one of the man’s ribs {from his body/side}” or “a rib {from the man’s body/side}” (2} “part of the man’s side {from his body}”
GEN	2	21	gn6x		וַ⁠יִּסְגֹּ֥ר בָּשָׂ֖ר תַּחְתֶּֽ⁠נָּה	1	and closed up its place {with} flesh.	“and filled in the place/hole where it had been with flesh {and healed it}.” or “and replaced it with flesh {and healed him}.” In this context, the term “flesh” probably includes muscles and skin.
GEN	2	22	vrrp	writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּבֶן֩ יְהוָ֨ה אֱלֹהִ֧ים	1	Then Yahweh God	“Next he” or “After that he”. For many languages it is more natural here to use a pronoun to refer to Yahweh God. Do what is best in your language. After you finish translating a chapter or section, it is a good practice to read that section aloud and listen for what is the best way to refer to God and others at each place in the text. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	2	22	zmft		וַ⁠יִּבֶן֩ אֶֽת הַ⁠צֵּלָ֛ע אֲשֶׁר לָקַ֥ח מִן הָֽ⁠אָדָ֖ם לְ⁠אִשָּׁ֑ה	1	built the rib which he had taken from the man into a woman,	“made/constructed a woman from the rib which he had taken out of the man{’s body},” or “used the rib which he taken from the man to make/construct a woman from it,” See how you translated “rib” in verse 21 and see the note about that there.
GEN	2	22	mozh	figs-go	וַ⁠יְבִאֶ֖⁠הָ אֶל הָֽ⁠אָדָֽם	1	and he brought her to the man.	“and he took her to the man.” or “Then he brought/took her to the man.” See how you translated “brought” in verse 19. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

GEN	2	23	scec		לְ⁠זֹאת֙ יִקָּרֵ֣א אִשָּׁ֔ה	1	She will be called ‘woman,’	“I will call her ‘woman,’ ” There is a play-on-words here because the Hebrew word for woman (“ishsha”) is similar to the Hebrew word for man (“ish”). You could put that information in a footnote.
GEN	2	23	prd0	figs-activepassive	כִּ֥י מֵ⁠אִ֖ישׁ לֻֽקֳחָה זֹּֽאת	0	because {it was} from a man {that} she was taken.”	“because she was taken {by God} from {the body of} a man.” or “because {it was} from {the body of} a man {that} {God} took her.” Consider what is the best way to translate this passive clause in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

Consider the best way to translate this in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	2	24	vred	figs-youdual	וְ⁠הָי֖וּ	1	and they	“so that they”. Some languages have a special dual pronoun for “they” that fits well here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
GEN	2	24	ustu	figs-idiom	וְ⁠הָי֖וּ לְ⁠בָשָׂ֥ר אֶחָֽד	1	will become one flesh.	“become completely one/united.” or “they will become united in body {and spirit}.” or “will become united like one person.” The phrase “one flesh” is an idiom that emphasizes the close physical and spiritual unity between a husband and wife. Other languages may have a similar idiom. Consider how to best communicate this in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	2	25	zioa		וַ⁠יִּֽהְי֤וּ שְׁנֵי⁠הֶם֙ עֲרוּמִּ֔ים הָֽ⁠אָדָ֖ם וְ⁠אִשְׁתּ֑⁠וֹ	1	And the man and his wife were both naked,	“Now {at/during that time} both the man and his wife were naked,” or “{At/During that time} the man and his wife did not wear any clothes,”
GEN	2	25	txt2		וְ⁠לֹ֖א יִתְבֹּשָֽׁשׁוּ	1	but they were not ashamed.	“but {yet} they were not ashamed {about it}.” or “but {yet} they did not feel ashamed/embarrassed {about being naked}.” Some languages have an idiom for this clause that fits well here. Do what is best in your language.
GEN	3	1	c2hn		וְ⁠הַ⁠נָּחָשׁ֙	1	Now the serpent	“Now the snake”. The conjunction “Now” introduces background information about the serpent. See how you translated this conjunction in Gen 2:5, 8, 19. (See: grammar-connect–time-background)
GEN	3	1	k5c6		הָיָ֣ה עָר֔וּם מִ⁠כֹּל֙ חַיַּ֣ת הַ⁠שָּׂדֶ֔ה	1	was more crafty than every living thing of the field	“was more {deceptive and} clever/cunning than any of the {other} creatures/animals that live in the fields/wild” or “was the craftiest of all the animals”. Make sure that your translation of “crafty” means that the snake had evil intent and was clever in a way that was not good. See how you translated “living thing of the field” in Gen 2:19-20.
GEN	3	1	zfck		אֲשֶׁ֥ר עָשָׂ֖ה יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהִ֑ים	1	that Yahweh God had made.	“that Yahweh {who is} God had made/created.” or “that God {whose name is Yahweh) had made/created.” Make sure your translation of this phrase refers to the animals that God had made, not the fields. Also see how you translated “Yahweh God” in chapter 2, beginning in verse 4.
GEN	3	1	ijbl	writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר֙	1	And he	“{One day} he” or “{One day} the serpent/snake”. If you use a pronoun (“he”) here in your translation, make sure it refers to the serpent, not God. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	3	1	gw5y	writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר֙ אֶל הָ֣⁠אִשָּׁ֔ה	1	said to the woman	“asked the woman,” or “{came/went to the woman and} asked her,” The snake asked a question, so some languages have to be more specific and say “asked” in the quote margin. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])

Consider whether it is better in your language to translate this embedded quote as a direct or indirect quote. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
GEN	3	1	fekv		מִ⁠כֹּ֖ל עֵ֥ץ הַ⁠גָּֽן	1	from any tree of the garden’?”	“{fruit} from any of the trees (that is/are} in the garden?” or “{any fruit} from the trees in the garden?” See how you translated “garden” in Genesis 2, beginning in verse 8.

The woman is not including the snake when she says “we” here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
GEN	3	2	zqay		מִ⁠פְּרִ֥י	1	from the fruit of	“the fruit of/from” or “fruit from”. See how you translated “fruit” in Gen 1:11-12, 29.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
GEN	3	4	o6z2		וַ⁠יֹּ֥אמֶר הַ⁠נָּחָ֖שׁ	1	But the serpent	“But the snake”. See how you translated “serpent” in verses 1-2.

GEN	3	5	vgp7		כִּ֗י בְּ⁠יוֹם֙	1	that on the day	“that as soon as”. See how you translated this phrase in Gen 2:17.
GEN	3	5	hm2r	figs-dual	אֲכָלְ⁠כֶ֣ם מִמֶּ֔⁠נּוּ	1	you eat from it,	“you eat {fruit} from that tree,” or “you eat some of that fruit,” The pronouns “you” and “your” are plural in this verse and refer to the man and the woman. Some languages have a special dual pronoun for this. Consider again how you translated “you” and “your” in verses 1-5. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-dual]])
GEN	3	5	uq66	figs-idiom	וְ⁠נִפְקְח֖וּ עֵֽינֵי⁠כֶ֑ם	1	then your eyes will be opened,	“your mind/understanding will be opened/expanded,” or “you will gain/have new understanding,” or “you will understand/know new things,” Consider whether your language has an idiom like “your eyes will be opened” that would fit well here.

GEN	3	5	kcja	figs-grammar-connect-logic-result	וִ⁠הְיִיתֶם֙	1	and	“and {as a result}” or “so that”. The following clause is the result of their eyes being opened. Consider the best way to communicate that in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-grammar-connect-logic-result]])

It can mean (1) “God”, as it does everywhere else in the first 30 chapters of Genesis; (2) “gods” or “divine beings”; (3) “angels”. See how you translated “good and evil” in Gen 2:9, 17.
GEN	3	6	vlkr		וַ⁠תֵּ֣רֶא הָֽ⁠אִשָּׁ֡ה כִּ֣י	1	And the woman saw that	“The woman saw/observed that”
GEN	3	6	lh3w	figs-synecdoche	הָ⁠עֵ֨ץ	1	the tree	“the tree {produced fruit that}” or “{the fruit of} that tree” or “the tree{’s fruit}”. The word “tree” refers here to the fruit that is produced by that tree. Make sure that is clear in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

GEN	3	7	pdls	figs-youdual	וַֽ⁠יִּתְפְּרוּ֙	1	So they sewed	“So they fastened/joined {together}”. The word for “sewed” implies here that some type of needle and thread were used. For example, they may have used a thin, sharpened stick for the needle, and plant fibers for the thread. If necessary, you could use a more general term such as “fastened/joined together” or “connected”. Also, some languages have dual pronouns that can be used in verses 7-8 for “they” and “themselves”. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
GEN	3	7	ldy2	translate-unknown	עֲלֵ֣ה תְאֵנָ֔ה	1	fig leaves	“{some} fig {tree} leaves” or “{some} {large} leaves from a fig tree”. Historical facts should not be changed in a translation, including the historical fact that Adam and Eve used fig tree leaves to make aprons. If fig trees are not known in your language area, you could say “{large} leaves from a tree called fig {tree}”. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
GEN	3	7	h556		וַ⁠יַּעֲשׂ֥וּ לָ⁠הֶ֖ם חֲגֹרֹֽת	1	and made aprons for themselves.	“and used/wore them like/as aprons/skirts/loincloths {to cover their nakedness/bodies}.” or “and wore them around their waists {to cover their nakedness/bodies}.” or “and used them to make clothes for themselves.” These aprons/skirts probably covered them from the waist down to somewhere around the knees.
GEN	3	8	ghlh	writing-pronouns	וַֽ⁠יִּשְׁמְע֞וּ	1	Then they heard	“Then/Later the man and his wife heard”. For some languages it may be clearer and more natural to put the noun phrase “the man and his wife” here and then use a pronoun (“they”) later in this sentence. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	3	8	ky1h		אֶת ק֨וֹל יְהוָ֧ה אֱלֹהִ֛ים מִתְהַלֵּ֥ךְ	1	the sound of Yahweh God walking	“the sound of Yahweh God{’s footsteps} as he walked” or “Yahweh God’s voice as he walked”. This phrase can refer to the sound of God’s footsteps or to the sound of his voice. Either meaning fits the context well and is followed by many translations.
GEN	3	8	qb26		בַּ⁠גָּ֖ן	1	in the garden	“{around} in the garden” or “through the garden”
GEN	3	8	q93u	figs-idiom	לְ⁠ר֣וּחַ הַ⁠יּ֑וֹם	1	in the breeze of the day,	“{late in the afternoon} in/during the breezy/cool {time} of the day,” or “{late that afternoon/day} when there was a cool breeze blowing,” This idiom refers to the late afternoon or early evening when there is a breeze blowing and it is cooler. For some languages it is more natural to put this time phrase at the beginning of the sentence. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	3	8	vdha	writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּתְחַבֵּ֨א הָֽ⁠אָדָ֜ם וְ⁠אִשְׁתּ֗⁠וֹ	1	but the man and his wife	“but/so they”. If you use “the man and his wife” earlier in this verse in your translation, consider whether a pronoun should be used here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	3	8	nrsx		וַ⁠יִּתְחַבֵּ֨א	1	hid	“hid {themselves}” or “{tried to} hide {themselves}”

GEN	3	8	rxgs		עֵ֥ץ הַ⁠גָּֽן	1	of the garden.	“in the garden.” or “there.” Since the garden is already mentioned earlier in verse 8, it may be more natural to be general here and say “there”. Do what is best in your language.
GEN	3	9	kfdj		וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֛א יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	So Yahweh God	“Then/But Yahweh God”. See how you translated this name for God in verses 1 and 8.

Also consider the best way to translate this quote margin in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	3	9	a1p4	figs-yousingular	אַיֶּֽ⁠כָּה	1	“Where {are} you?”	“{Adam,} where are you?” Notice that the word “you” is singular here because God is only addressing the man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
GEN	3	10	sg1j	writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֕אמֶר	1	And he said,	“He/Adam answered {him},” or “The man replied,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])

GEN	3	11	dbke	writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֕אמֶר	1	Then he said,	“So Yahweh God asked {him},” Make sure your translation of “he” refers to Yahweh here, not the man. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
GEN	3	11	hr6s		הֲ⁠מִן הָ⁠עֵ֗ץ אָכָֽלְתָּ	1	Did you eat from the tree	“Did you {disobey me and} eat {fruit} from the tree”

Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
GEN	3	12	ylud		וַ⁠יֹּ֖אמֶר הָֽ⁠אָדָ֑ם	1	Then the man said,	“But the man said/replied {to him},” or “The man answered {him},”

The pronoun “she” is emphatic in the Hebrew text. That, along with the position of “The woman” at the beginning of the sentence, shows that the man is strongly emphasizing his blame on the woman. Translate this clause in your language in a way that will show that emphasis.
GEN	3	12	xvky		נָֽתְנָה לִּ֥⁠י מִן הָ⁠עֵ֖ץ	1	gave me {fruit} from the tree,	“gave me {some fruit} from that tree,” or “gave me some of the/that fruit,” See how you translated “fruit” in verses 1-6.
GEN	3	12	aoea		וָ⁠אֹכֵֽל	1	and I ate {it}.”	“so I ate {it}.” or “That is why I ate {it/some}.” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
GEN	3	13	ztpc	writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר יְהוָ֧ה אֱלֹהִ֛ים לָ⁠אִשָּׁ֖ה	1	Then Yahweh God said to the woman,	“So Yahweh God asked the woman,” Consider what is the best way to translate this quote margin in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	3	13	h9ju		מַה זֹּ֣את עָשִׂ֑ית	1	“What {is} this you have done?”	“What have you done?” or “What did you do?” or “Tell me what you have done.” God already knew the answer to this question, but he is giving the woman a chance to confess and explain what she did. God’s question probably also implies that he is displeased with what has happened.
GEN	3	13	pwzw	writing-quotations	וַ⁠תֹּ֨אמֶר֙ הָֽ⁠אִשָּׁ֔ה	1	And the woman said,	“But the woman said/replied {to him},” or “The woman said/replied,” or “She replied,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	3	13	vmze		הַ⁠נָּחָ֥שׁ	1	“The serpent	“The snake” or “It was the serpent/snake that”. This phrase is emphasized in the Hebrew text.

GEN	3	13	xway		וָ⁠אֹכֵֽל	1	so I ate {it}.”	“so I ate {some of the/that fruit}.” or “That is why I ate {it/some}.” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

In this context, “cursed” involves God punishing the serpent and its descendants by causing them to suffer by crawling along the ground on their bellies and having a hostile relationship with human beings. Make sure that the way you translate this term does not imply the use of magic. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms]])
GEN	3	14	qmno		מִ⁠כָּל	1	above	“more {severely/harshly} than”. When Adam and Eve sinned and God judged them, the curse and punishment of death and decay also affected everything that was under their authority, including the animals. Here in Gen 3:14, God puts a more severe curse on the serpent (and his descendants) than he put on the rest of the animals.
GEN	3	14	uqj9		מִ⁠כָּל הַ⁠בְּהֵמָ֔ה	1	all the livestock	“all the domestic/tame animals”. See how you translated “livestock” in Gen 1:24-26; 2:20.
GEN	3	14	swjt		וּ⁠מִ⁠כֹּ֖ל חַיַּ֣ת הַ⁠שָּׂדֶ֑ה	1	and above every living thing of the field.	“and more {severely/harshly} than all the creatures/animals of/in the fields/wild.” or “and more {severely/harshly} than all the wild animals.” See how you translated “every living thing of the field” in verse 1.
GEN	3	14	b0b5		עַל גְּחֹנְ⁠ךָ֣ תֵלֵ֔ךְ	1	You will move on your belly,	“{As a result,} you will/must move/crawl {on/along the ground} on your belly/stomach,”
GEN	3	14	s2kp		וְ⁠עָפָ֥ר תֹּאכַ֖ל	1	and you will eat dust	“and you will/must eat dust/dirt {with your food}”. Make sure your translation of this clause does not imply that dust or dirt is all the snake will eat. Rather it could mean that dirt will get into his mouth when he eats his food, or it could be an idiom that refers to the fact that as he slithers along, his mouth will always be close to the dirt on the ground (a position of humility). Also see how you translated “dust” in Gen 2:7.
GEN	3	14	soz0		כָּל יְמֵ֥י חַיֶּֽי⁠ךָ	1	all the days of your life.	“your entire life.” or “for as long as you live.”

GEN	3	15	qt60		ה֚וּא	1	He	“{In fact,} her offspring/descendant” or “{In fact,} one of her descendants”. The pronoun “He” is ambiguous here. It could refer to (1) the woman’s descendant (Jesus) who would one day come to earth as the Messiah/Christ. (2) the woman’s descendants who will constantly be enemies of the snake’s descendants. If you follow the first interpretation, this would be the first prophecy in the Bible about the Messiah/Christ (“the Anointed One” or “the Promised Savior King”) who would come to earth and destroy Satan’s power (Hebrews 2:14). You could include that information in a footnote.
GEN	3	15	nq22	figs-infostructure	יְשׁוּפְ⁠ךָ֣ רֹ֔אשׁ וְ⁠אַתָּ֖ה תְּשׁוּפֶ֥⁠נּוּ עָקֵֽב	1	will strike you {on} the head, and you will strike him {on} the heel.”	“will strike/crush your head, and you will strike/bite/bruise his heel.” This is figurative language that Satan will harm the Messiah, but the Messiah will destroy him. For some languages it is better to switch the order of these clauses and say, “{In fact,} you will strike/bite/bruise the heel of one of her descendants, but he will strike/crush your head.” Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	3	16	c0pe	writing-pronouns	אֶֽל הָ⁠אִשָּׁ֣ה אָמַ֗ר	1	To the woman he said,	“{Then} he/God said to the woman,” or “{Then} Yahweh God {turned} to the woman and said {to her},” In the Hebrew text, “to the woman” comes first in this sentence, to emphasize her. Do what is natural in your language. Also consider what is the best way to refer to God here in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	3	16	gnbd		הַרְבָּ֤ה אַרְבֶּה֙ עִצְּבוֹנֵ֣⁠ךְ	1	“I will greatly multiply your pain	“I will greatly increase how much you suffer” or “I will cause you to have/experience much/severe pain” or “I will cause it to be very painful”

If possible, it is best to keep both parts of the parallelism in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
GEN	3	16	o7v4		וְ⁠אֶל אִישֵׁ⁠ךְ֙ תְּשׁ֣וּקָתֵ֔⁠ךְ וְ⁠ה֖וּא	1	Yet your desire {will be} for your husband, and	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here, because the conjunctions and the idiom “your desire will be for your husband” are all ambiguous in this context. The text can mean (1) “Yet/But you will {still} desire/long {to be with} your husband, and....”, which is similar to what “desire” means in Song of Songs 7:10. (2) “Besides that, you will desire/want {to control} your husband, but....”, which is similar to what “desire” means in Gen 4:7. The interpretation that is not followed in your translation could be put in a footnote.
GEN	3	16	fn06		וְ⁠ה֖וּא יִמְשָׁל בָּֽ⁠ךְ	1	he will rule over you.”	“he will have authority over you.” or “he will control you.” or “he will lord it over you.” See how you translated “rule over” in Gen 1:18. It may be necessary to translate this term differently here because of the negative context of the curse and the consequences of sin.
GEN	3	17	uwr5		וּ⁠לְ⁠אָדָ֣ם אָמַ֗ר	1	Then to the man he said,	“Then/Next he/God said to the man,” or “Then/Next Yahweh God {turned} to Adam and said {to him},” In the Hebrew text, “to the man” is emphasized. See how you translated a similar case (“to the woman”) in verse 16. For a note about when to start using Adam’s name in your translation see Gen 2:19.
GEN	3	17	jib9		כִּֽי שָׁמַעְתָּ֮	1	“Since you	“Since/Because you {disobeyed me and}”
GEN	3	17	fpb6	figs-metonymy	שָׁמַעְתָּ֮ לְ⁠ק֣וֹל אִשְׁתֶּ⁠ךָ֒	1	listened to the voice of your wife	“did what your wife said/suggested” or “did/followed what your wife told you to do”. This phrase means that Adam heard what his wife said to him and then did what she said. Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
GEN	3	17	ko7u		וַ⁠תֹּ֨אכַל֙ מִן הָ⁠עֵ֔ץ	1	and ate from the tree	“and ate {fruit} from the tree”
GEN	3	17	czdp	figs-quotesinquotes	אֲשֶׁ֤ר צִוִּיתִ֨י⁠ךָ֙ לֵ⁠אמֹ֔ר לֹ֥א תֹאכַ֖ל מִמֶּ֑⁠נּוּ	0	that I commanded you, saying, ‘You must not eat from it,’	“that I commanded/told you, “Do not eat {any fruit} from it,” or “that I commanded you to not eat {any fruit} from.” Consider whether it is better in your language to translate this embedded quote as a direct or indirect quote. Also see how you translated this command in verse 3. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])
GEN	3	17	p0t0	figs-infostructure	אֲרוּרָ֤ה הָֽ⁠אֲדָמָה֙ בַּֽ⁠עֲבוּרֶ֔⁠ךָ	1	the ground is cursed because of you.	“the ground is cursed {by me} because of what you did.” or “I have cursed the ground because you sinned.” For some languages it may be clearer or more natural to break up this long sentence and say, “You did what your wife said and ate {fruit} from the tree that I commanded you not to eat {any fruit} from. Because of what you did, I have cursed the ground.” Also see how you translated “cursed” in verse 14. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	3	17	uydk	grammar-connect-logic-result	בְּ⁠עִצָּבוֹן֙ תֹּֽאכֲלֶ֔⁠נָּה	1	By painful toil you will eat {from} it	“{As a result,} {only} by painful toil will you eat {any food} from it” or “{As a result,} you will have to work {very} hard and suffer {to grow/get enough food} to eat” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
GEN	3	17	f6k5	figs-infostructure	כֹּ֖ל יְמֵ֥י חַיֶּֽי⁠ךָ	1	all the days of your life.	“every day of your life.” or “for your entire life.” or “for as long as you live.” You could put this clause before the previous clause and say, “{As a result,} for as long as you live, you will have to work {very} hard and suffer...” Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	3	18	hvzb	figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠ק֥וֹץ וְ⁠דַרְדַּ֖ר תַּצְמִ֣יחַֽ	1	And it will produce thorn{s} and thistle{s}	“In fact, the ground will produce/grow thorn {plants} and thistle {plants} {and other weeds}” or “In fact, thornbushes and thistle plants {and other weeds} will grow from the ground”. The thorn and thistle plants represent all types of weeds, which are useless, and possibly harmful, plants. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
GEN	3	18	y521		לָ֑⁠ךְ וְ⁠אָכַלְתָּ֖ אֶת עֵ֥שֶׂב הַ⁠שָּׂדֶֽה	0	for you, and you will eat the plant{s} of the field{s}.	The Hebrew text here can mean (1) “{and make it difficult} for you to grow {enough} crops in the/your fields for food.” or “so that you will have to work very hard in your fields to grow/produce {enough} crops/food to eat.” (2) “so that {your crops will not grow well and} you will {have to} eat {wild} plants that grow in the {open} fields {to survive}.” That difference of interpretation is caused because the Hebrew word “fields” can refer to land that people cultivate or to uncultivated land where wild plants grow.
GEN	3	19	am0y	figs-idiom	בְּ⁠זֵעַ֤ת אַפֶּ֨י⁠ךָ֙ תֹּ֣אכַל	1	By the sweat of your nose you will	“By the sweat of your face/brow/forehead” or “You will have to {work hard and} sweat a lot in order to”. The phrase “by the sweat of your nose/brow” is an idiom that refers to hard physical labor. Consider whether or not your language has a similar idiom. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	3	19	wlln	figs-idiom	תֹּ֣אכַל לֶ֔חֶם	1	eat bread,	“{grow/produce/have} {enough} food to eat,” Bread was one of the main food staples for that time and culture, so the Hebrew word for “bread” is used here as an idiom that refers to all food, not just bread. Consider whether your language does something similar, using one type of food (such as bread, rice or potatoes) to refer to all food in general. Or you could use a general term like “food”, especially if bread is rare or expensive in your language area. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	3	19	cwg1		עַ֤ד שֽׁוּבְ⁠ךָ֙ אֶל הָ֣⁠אֲדָמָ֔ה	1	until you return to the ground,	“until you {die and} again become dust/dirt,”
GEN	3	19	zy53		כִּ֥י מִמֶּ֖⁠נָּה לֻקָּ֑חְתָּ	1	since from it you were taken.	“which you were taken/made from {by me}.” or “which I took/created you from.” or “which I made/created you out of.”
GEN	3	19	tovm	grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּֽי	1	For	“Yes/Indeed,” or “That’s right,” This sentence rephrases and emphasizes what God just said. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
GEN	3	19	qqei		עָפָ֣ר אַ֔תָּה	1	you {are} dust	“your bodies {were created/made} {by me} from dust/dirt” or “{I created/made} you out of dust/dirt”
GEN	3	19	lk6g		וְ⁠אֶל עָפָ֖ר תָּשֽׁוּב	1	and to dust you will return.”	“so dust/dirt is what you will become again {after you die}.”
GEN	3	20	zgfh		וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֧א הָֽ⁠אָדָ֛ם	1	Then the man	“Then Adam”. Some translations use Adam’s name here because he is naming Eve. See what you did in verse 17.
GEN	3	20	npwg		וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֧א שֵׁ֥ם אִשְׁתּ֖⁠וֹ	1	called the name of his wife	“called/named his wife” or “gave his wife the name”
GEN	3	20	mqgh	translate-names	חַוָּ֑ה	1	Eve,	“Eve, {which means “living/live,”}” If you include the meaning of Eve’s name in your translation or in a footnote, make sure it is similar to the word in the following clause that has the same meaning (“living”), so that it is clear why Eve was given that name. The meaning of names is important in the Hebrew language, and this translation issue occurs frequently in the book of Genesis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
GEN	3	20	aj87		כִּ֛י	1	because	“{He did that} because”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
GEN	3	20	g73g		הִ֥וא הָֽיְתָ֖ה אֵ֥ם	1	she was the mother	“she would be the mother/ancestor”
GEN	3	20	wdwn		אֵ֥ם כָּל חָֽי	1	of all the living.	“of all the people who would ever live.” or “of everyone who would ever live.”
GEN	3	21	ofk2		וַ⁠יַּעַשׂ֩ יְהוָ֨ה אֱלֹהִ֜ים כָּתְנ֥וֹת ע֖וֹר	1	Then Yahweh God made garments of {animal} skins	“Then Yahweh God made {some} garments/clothes out of animal skins/hides” or “Then Yahweh God used {some} animal skins/hides to make {some} garments/clothes”
GEN	3	21	e2st		לְ⁠אָדָ֧ם וּ⁠לְ⁠אִשְׁתּ֛⁠וֹ	1	for Adam and his wife,	“for Adam and his wife {Eve},” or “for the man and his wife,”
GEN	3	21	j6mp		וַ⁠יַּלְבִּשֵֽׁ⁠ם	1	and he clothed them.	“and he dressed them.” or “and he put the garments/clothes on them.”
GEN	3	22	wtrd	writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהִ֗ים	1	Then Yahweh God	“Then he”. Consider whether it is best in your language to use Yahweh’s name or a pronoun in this context. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	3	22	lo9b		וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר	1	said,	said/thought,” or “said/thought {to himself}”. See how you translated a similar quote margin in Gen 1:26, where “said” has the same meaning.
GEN	3	22	v4bl		הֵ֤ן	1	“Behold,	“Look/Listen,” This word expresses emotion and calls attention to what God says next. See how you translated this term in Gen 1:29.
GEN	3	22	fa6c		הָֽ⁠אָדָם֙	1	the man	“the man {and his wife}” or “man{kind}” or “human beings”. Throughout verses 22-24 “the man” represents mankind, which included both the man and the woman at this point. Make sure your translation communicates that clearly in those verses and does not just refer to Adam.
GEN	3	22	xhom	figs-exclusive	הָיָה֙ כְּ⁠אַחַ֣ד מִמֶּ֔⁠נּוּ	1	has become like one of us	“have become like one of us” or “have become like us”. The pronoun “us” is inclusive because God is talking to himself. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
GEN	3	22	ardi		לָ⁠דַ֖עַת ט֣וֹב וָ⁠רָ֑ע	1	in knowing good and evil.	“so that they know {what is} good and {what is} evil.” See how you translated this phrase in verse 5, and a similar phrase in Gen 2:9.
GEN	3	22	qh8y	figs-activepassive	וְ⁠עַתָּ֣ה פֶּן יִשְׁלַ֣ח	1	And now he must not be allowed to	“So now they must not be permitted {by us} to” or “So we must not allow/permit them to” or “So now we must do something so that they do/can not”. Consider the best way to translate this passive clause in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
GEN	3	22	w01g		יִשְׁלַ֣ח יָד֗⁠וֹ וְ⁠לָקַח֙ גַּ֚ם מֵ⁠עֵ֣ץ הַֽ⁠חַיִּ֔ים וְ⁠אָכַ֖ל	1	reach out his hand and also take {fruit} from the tree of life and eat it	“also take/pick and eat fruit from the tree of {eternal} life,” or “also eat fruit from the tree that gives people {eternal} life,” See how you translated “took/picked fruit” in verse 6, and how you translated “the tree of life” in Gen 2:9.
GEN	3	22	hon5		וָ⁠חַ֥י לְ⁠עֹלָֽם	1	and live forever!”	“and {then/so} live forever!” or “which will/would make them live forever!”
GEN	3	23	o34p		וַֽ⁠יְשַׁלְּחֵ֛⁠הוּ יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	So Yahweh God	“Then Yahweh God” or “So {then} Yahweh God”. Consider again how you translated “Yahweh God” in Genesis 2 and 3, and see the note about this at Gen 2:4.
GEN	3	23	y7am		וַֽ⁠יְשַׁלְּחֵ֛⁠הוּ מִ⁠גַּן	1	sent him out of	“forced them to leave” or “expelled/banished the man {and his wife} from”. Notice that in verses 22-24, “the man”, “him”, and “he” refer to mankind, that is, the man and the woman. Make sure it is clear in your translation here that both of them were sent out of the garden, not just the man. Some languages have dual pronouns that are used for “they” and “them” in verses 22-24.
GEN	3	23	wsgu		מִ⁠גַּן עֵ֑דֶן	1	the Garden of Eden	“the garden in {the land/region of/called} Eden” or “Eden Garden”. See how you translated this phrase in Gen 2:15.
GEN	3	23	odke		לַֽ⁠עֲבֹד֙ אֶת הָ֣⁠אֲדָמָ֔ה	1	to work the ground	“to work/farm/cultivate the ground/land/soil”. See how you translated “work the ground” in Gen 2:5 and “work it” in 2:15.
GEN	3	23	c3es		אֲשֶׁ֥ר לֻקַּ֖ח מִ⁠שָּֽׁם	1	which he had been taken from.	“which they had been taken/created from {by him/God}.” or “which God/he had taken/made them from.” It does not refer to the exact ground that he was made from. See how you translated “taken from” in verse 19.
GEN	3	24	pf8d		וַ⁠יְגָ֖רֶשׁ	1	And after	“Then after” or “After”
GEN	3	24	vbei		וַ⁠יְגָ֖רֶשׁ אֶת הָֽ⁠אָדָ֑ם	1	he drove the man out,	“he/Yahweh/God drove/forced the man {and his wife} out {of the garden},” or “he/Yahweh/God expelled/banished them {from the garden},”
GEN	3	24	pea9		וַ⁠יַּשְׁכֵּן֩	1	then he placed	“then he stationed” or “he placed/stationed”
GEN	3	24	f21i		מִ⁠קֶּ֨דֶם לְ⁠גַן עֵ֜דֶן	1	on the east side of the Garden of Eden	“on/to the east {side} of the garden {at its entrance}” or “{at the entrance} of/to the garden, {which was} on its east side”. It is implied that the entrance to the garden is where the cherubim were placed to keep everyone from ever entering the garden again. Consider again how you translated “garden” in Gen 2:8-10, 15-16; 3:1-3, 8, 10, 23-24.
GEN	3	24	ijzp	translate-unknown	אֶת הַ⁠כְּרֻבִ֗ים	1	cherubim {angels}	“{some} {powerful} cherubim {angels}” or “{some} {powerful beings called} cherubim {angels}”. Most translations transliterate or borrow this term from Hebrew throughout the Bible. Cherubim are a special category of very powerful angels. Each one has four faces: a human face, a lion’s face, a bull’s face and an eagle’s face (Ezekiel 1:10; 10:14). Each of them also has multiple wings. You could include some of that information in a footnote. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
GEN	3	24	sikx		וְ⁠אֵ֨ת לַ֤הַט הַ⁠חֶ֨רֶב֙	1	and a flaming sword	“and a blazing/fiery/burning sword” or “and a sword made of flames”. A sword is a weapon that has a very long, sharp (often two-sided) blade that is longer than a knife, machete, or dagger and is attached to a hilt or handle. This sword may have had flames coming from it, or this may have been fire in the shape of a sword.
GEN	3	24	auol		הַ⁠מִּתְהַפֶּ֔כֶת	1	turning in every direction	“that was turning/swinging around in all directions” or “that was swinging/flashing back and forth”. It seems that the sword was swinging by itself since there is no mention of anyone holding it.
GEN	3	24	naf8		לִ⁠שְׁמֹ֕ר אֶת דֶּ֖רֶךְ	1	to guard the way of	“to keep everyone away from the way/path {that leads/goes} to” or “so that no one could get/go near”
GEN	3	24	m9s0		עֵ֥ץ הַֽ⁠חַיִּֽים	1	the tree of life.	“the tree of {eternal} life.” or “the tree whose fruit gives people {eternal} life.” or “the tree whose fruit makes people live {forever}.” See how you translated this phrase in Gen 2:9 and 3:22.
GEN	4	1	u750		וְ⁠הָ֣⁠אָדָ֔ם	1	Then the man	“Then Adam” or “Then the man {Adam}”. For a note about when to begin referring to the man as Adam, see Gen 2:19.
GEN	4	1	dtfa	figs-euphemism	יָדַ֖ע אֶת חַוָּ֣ה אִשְׁתּ֑⁠וֹ	1	knew Eve his wife,	“had {marital} relations with his wife Eve,” or “slept with his wife Eve,” or “was intimate with his wife Eve,” This phrase is a Hebrew idiom that means Adam had marital/sexual relations with Eve. Many languages have a similar idiom. Make sure you translate this in a way that is polite and will not offend or embarrass people, especially when read aloud. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
GEN	4	1	kkim		וַ⁠תַּ֨הַר֙	1	and she	“so that she” or “with the result that she”
GEN	4	1	eogq		וַ⁠תַּ֨הַר֙ וַ⁠תֵּ֣לֶד	1	conceived and bore	“became pregnant and {later} gave birth to”. Translate this term in a way that will not embarrass people, especially when read aloud.
GEN	4	1	qilu		אֶת קַ֔יִן	1	Cain.	“{a son they named} Cain, {which means “obtained/acquired”.}” You could include the meaning of Cain’s name in your translation or in a footnote. See what you did for a similar case in Gen 3:20.
GEN	4	1	dp64		וַ⁠תֹּ֕אמֶר	1	And she said,	“because she said/exclaimed,” or “{They named him that} because she/Eve had said/exclaimed,” This sentence explains how Cain got his name. Make sure that is clear in your translation. Also consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
GEN	4	1	g9cu		קָנִ֥יתִי	1	“I have obtained	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) “I have obtained/acquired” (2) “I have produced/created”. If you include the meaning of Cain’s name earlier in this verse in your translation or in a footnote, make sure it matches your choice here, so that it is clear why he was given that name.
GEN	4	1	m95l		אִ֖ישׁ	1	a man	“a male child” or “a boy/son” or “a baby boy”. For some languages it is confusing to refer to a newborn baby as a man. Do what is clear and natural in your language.
GEN	4	1	vvxm	figs-infostructure	אֶת יְהוָֽה	1	with Yahweh!”	“with {help from} Yahweh!” or “with Yahweh{’s help}!” For some languages it is more natural to put this phrase earlier in this sentence and say, “With Yahweh’s help I have obtained/acquired a son!” or “Yahweh has enabled/helped me to obtain/get a son!” Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	4	2	y2h7	writing-pronouns	וַ⁠תֹּ֣סֶף	1	Then she	“Then she/Eve” or “After that she/Eve”. Consider whether it is better in your language to use a pronoun or a noun to refer to Eve here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	4	2	a960	translate-kinship	וַ⁠תֹּ֣סֶף לָ⁠לֶ֔דֶת אֶת אָחִ֖י⁠ו	1	continued on to bear his brother	“also gave birth to his/Cain’s brother” or “gave birth to another baby boy, {who was} his/Cain’s brother”. The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. Cain and Abel may have been twins, or Abel may have been born sometime later after Eve became pregnant again. If possible, translate verse 2 in a way that allows for either interpretation. Also, if your language has a specific term for “younger brother”, you could use it here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
GEN	4	2	ihru		אֶת הָ֑בֶל	1	Abel.	“{whom they named} Abel.” or “{whose name was} Abel.”
GEN	4	2	o0na	grammar-connect-time-background	וַֽ⁠יְהִי הֶ֨בֶל֙	1	Now Abel	“Now {when the boys had grown up,} Abel” or “{When they grew up,} Abel”. This sentence introduces background information for what happens next. Consider the best way to begin this sentence in your language. Also, It is implied here that the boys had grown up to be adults. If necessary, you could make that explicit in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
GEN	4	2	qqop		וַֽ⁠יְהִי רֹ֣עֵה צֹ֔אן	1	became a keeper of flock{s},	“became/was a keeper/herder of flocks/sheep,” or “became/was a shepherd,” or “raised sheep {and goats},” A flock can be a large group of sheep or goats, or a mixture of both.
GEN	4	2	uipw	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וְ⁠קַ֕יִן	1	and Cain	“whereas/but Cain”. Consider the best way in your language to contrast Cain and his work with Abel and his work. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
GEN	4	2	wbaf		הָיָ֖ה עֹבֵ֥ד אֲדָמָֽה	1	became a worker of the ground.	“became/was a worker/tiller/farmer of the ground/soil.” or “became/was a {crop} farmer.” or “grew {food} crops.” Cain raised crops, not animals. See how you translated a similar phrase (“work the ground”) in Gen 2:5.
GEN	4	3	bevf	writing-newevent	וַֽ⁠יְהִ֖י מִ⁠קֵּ֣ץ יָמִ֑ים וַ⁠יָּבֵ֨א	1	And it happened in the course of days that	“Then one day it happened that” or “As time went on/by, one day”. These phrases introduce an important new event. Consider the best way to do that in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
GEN	4	3	bqtc		וַ⁠יָּבֵ֨א קַ֜יִן	1	Cain brought	“Cain offered/gave”
GEN	4	3	uvav		מִ⁠פְּרִ֧י	1	some of the fruit	“some of the crops” or “some of the edible plants”. The word “fruit” is general here and refers to any edible plant or crop that grows as the result of being cultivated. Make sure that is clear in your translation.
GEN	4	3	kv6g		מִ⁠פְּרִ֧י הָֽ⁠אֲדָמָ֛ה	1	of the ground	“{that he had harvested} from his farmland/fields” or “{that he had raised/grown} in his fields”
GEN	4	3	pcy0	translate-key-terms	מִנְחָ֖ה לַֽ⁠יהוָֽה	1	{as} an offering to Yahweh.	“to Yahweh as an offering/gift/sacrifice {to honor/worship him}.” The term “offering” refers to something that is given. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms]])
GEN	4	4	wsgj		וְ⁠הֶ֨בֶל הֵבִ֥יא גַם	1	And Abel also brought	“Abel also brought/offered/gave {an offering/gift/sacrifice} {to Yahweh}, {but what he offered/gave was}” or “But Abel offered/gave {to Yahweh}”. There is a contrast between Abel and Cain and between their offerings.
GEN	4	4	a4s9		מִ⁠בְּכֹר֥וֹת צֹאנ֖⁠וֹ	1	some of the firstborn of his flock{s}	“some of the firstborn {animals} from his flock{s}/sheep”. See how you translated “flocks” in verse 2.
GEN	4	4	e1u3		וּ⁠מֵֽ⁠חֶלְבֵ⁠הֶ֑ן	1	and some of their fat.	“and/including some of the fat portions of the meat.” or “and/including some of their best parts.” or “and/including the fattest/best parts of the animals/meat.” In that culture, fat was considered one of the best parts of an animal to eat. If that is different from how fat is viewed in your language area, that information could be put in a footnote.
GEN	4	4	s8cu		וַ⁠יִּ֣שַׁע יְהוָ֔ה אֶל	0	And Yahweh looked {favorably} on	“Yahweh was pleased/happy with” or “Yahweh accepted”
GEN	4	4	x67k		הֶ֖בֶל וְ⁠אֶל מִנְחָתֽ⁠וֹ	1	Abel and his offering.	“Abel and his gift/sacrifice.” or “Abel and what he offered/gave {to him}.”
GEN	4	5	svy9	writing-pronouns	וְ⁠אֶל שָׁעָ֑ה	1	But he	“But he/Yahweh” or “However, he/Yahweh” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	4	5	nsfa		וְ⁠אֶל קַ֥יִן לֹ֣א שָׁעָ֑ה	0	did not look {favorably} on Cain	“was not pleased/happy with Cain” or “did not accept Cain”. See how you translated “looked {favorably} on” in verse 4.
GEN	4	5	uas7		וְ⁠אֶל מִנְחָת֖⁠וֹ	1	and his offering.	“and/or his gift/sacrifice.” or “and/or what he offered/gave {to him}.”
GEN	4	5	hqxz	figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּ֤חַר לְ⁠קַ֨יִן֙ מְאֹ֔ד	1	So Cain burned with intense anger,	“So Cain was/became/felt extremely angry,” Many languages have a similar idiom that fits well here. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	4	5	oeh0	figs-idiom	וַֽ⁠יִּפְּל֖וּ פָּנָֽי⁠ו	1	and his face fell.	“and his face showed that he was angry/upset.” or “and he frowned/scowled.” or “and his face showed it.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	4	6	yi6m	writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֥אמֶר יְהוָ֖ה אֶל קָ֑יִן	1	Then Yahweh said to Cain,	“Then Yahweh asked Cain/him,” The way you translate this quote margin should fit with the way that you translated the following three rhetorical questions. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	4	6	k2r0	figs-rquestion	לָ֚⁠מָּה חָ֣רָה לָ֔⁠ךְ וְ⁠לָ֖⁠מָּה נָפְל֥וּ פָנֶֽי⁠ךָ	0	”Why are you burning with anger? And why is your face fallen?	“Why are you so angry? And why are you frowning/scowling?” or “There is no need/reason for you to be angry and frowning/scowling.” God is using these rhetorical questions to correct Cain. Consider the best way to communicate that in your language. Also see how you translated the idioms “burned with...anger” and “face fell” in verse 5. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

In verse 7 sin is personified, that is, it is treated as if it were alive, like a lion or some other fierce animal that wants to attack Cain. Some languages can do the same thing. Other languages cannot do that and must say something like: “then you are in great danger of being tempted to sin, but you must resist and not give in.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

Instead of that text, some ancient manuscripts (including the Samaritan Pentateuch, Septuagint, Latin Vulgate and Syriac) and many modern translations have: “Then Cain said to Abel his brother, “Let’s go out to the field {and work} {together}.” ” or “Then Cain invited/asked his brother Abel to go out to the field with him {to work}.” Some translation teams follow the way this verse is translated in a well-known translation, such as in the national language or in a neighboring language. Decide what to do in your translation. The textual variant that you do not use in your translation could be put in a footnote. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])

His response to God is rude and disrespectful. Consider whether or not a rhetorical question communicates that here in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

Usually translators transliterate (copy or borrow) the name from the Hebrew text, and they might also include the meaning of the name in the text or in a footnote. If you do that here, the meaning should be similar to how you translated “wanderer” in verses 12 and 14. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
GEN	4	16	w1sj		קִדְמַת עֵֽדֶן	1	east of Eden.	“{which was} east of {the land/region of/called} Eden.” or “{which was} east of Eden {Land}.” Consider again how you translated “{the land/region of} Eden” and “the Garden of Eden” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 2:8, 10, 15; 3:23-24; 4:16.

The phrase “father of” is used here as an idiom that means Jabal was the first person to do these things. He invented this way of living, and many people after him followed his example. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	4	20	ozwx	translate-unknown	יֹשֵׁ֥ב אֹ֖הֶל	1	live {in} tents	“are tent dwellers” or “live in portable shelters”. A tent is a portable living place that has walls made of cloth or animal skins and is held up by poles. Tents are used by people who need to take their home with them as they move from place to place, often to find food and water for themselves and their livestock. If people in your language area are not familiar with tents, you could include some of the above information in a footnote. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
GEN	4	20	tlg6		וּ⁠מִקְנֶֽה	1	and own livestock.	“and raise livestock/animals {for a living}.” The term “livestock” includes all kinds of domestic animals, such as cows, sheep, goats, camels, and donkeys. See how you translated “livestock” in Gen 1:24-26; 2:20, 3:14.

It can mean: (1) “I killed a man for wounding me; {he was} a young man who bruised/injured me!” or “I killed a young man for wounding/injuring me! In fact, I killed that man for {just} bruising me!” (2) “I killed a man for wounding me, and also a young man for bruising/injuring me.” or “A man wounded me, so I killed him. A young man injured me, so I killed him too!” In the first interpretation, Lamech refers to one man he killed. In the second interpretation, he refers to two men he killed.

He is not saying that God will avenge him more than he will avenge Cain. Be consistent with how you spelled the name “Lamech” in verses 18-19, 23-24.

It also implies that they were trusting in him to help and guide them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.
GEN	5	2	m62p		וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֤א אֶת שְׁמָ⁠ם֙	1	and called their name	“and called/named them”. See how you translated the phrase “called...name” in Gen 4:17, 25, 26.

For some languages it is clearer or more natural to put this clause earlier in this verse and say, “and on the {same} day {that} he created them, he blessed them and called/named them human beings.” Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])

Each translation team needs to decide how they are going to write large numbers in the Bible. Many teams use numerals, for example, “130” here in verse 3, especially if the target language has a complicated counting system. Other teams prefer to use words, for example, “one hundred thirty” here. Be consistent in what you do throughout your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers]])

So if you use a conjunction here, make sure your translation does not sound like verse 6 happened after Adam died. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])

GEN	5	32	c22e		וַ⁠יּ֣וֹלֶד נֹ֔חַ	1	Noah fathered	“he fathered/had”. Consider again how you translated “fathered” in this chapter; see verses 4, 6-7, 9-10, 12-13, 15-16, 18-19, 25-26, 28, 30, 32.

GEN	6	1	bn1n	grammar-connect-time-background	וַֽ⁠יְהִי֙	1	And	“Now”. The events in Gen 6:1-2 started happening long before the events in 5:32, so the way your translation begins this verse should allow for that meaning and not begin with a sequence word like “Then”, which would have the wrong meaning here. Many translations omit the conjunction here. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
GEN	6	1	pxaj	writing-background	וַֽ⁠יְהִי֙ כִּֽי	1	it happened when	“it happened that when/as” or “it happened that”. This phrase introduces and emphasizes important background information which the following narrative builds on. It also creates suspense so that readers and listeners wonder what will happen next. Some translations leave this phrase out, but that loses some of the suspense. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
GEN	6	1	nvhv		הָֽ⁠אָדָ֔ם	1	mankind	“human beings” or “people”. See how you translated this term in Gen 5:1-2.

GEN	6	2	mx0c		וַ⁠יִּרְא֤וּ	1	then	“then/Then {when those daughters/girls grew up,}” or “{When those daughters/girls grew up,}” Verses 1 and 2 are one long sentence in the Hebrew text. For many languages it is necessary to divide it into two or more shorter sentences. For example, depending on how you began verse one, you could begin verse 2 with a new sentence. Do what is best in your language.
GEN	6	2	gpks		בְנֵי הָֽ⁠אֱלֹהִים֙	1	the sons of God	“{some} angels” or “{some} supernatural beings”. The meaning of Gen 6:2 is not certain and is heavily debated, so it is probably best to translate it fairly literally and possibly include a footnote about what it means. If it is not translated literally, the literal text should be put in a footnote. There are three main views of who “the sons of God” and “the daughters of mankind” refer to: (1) nonhuman, god-like beings (supernatural beings), such as angels (as in Job 1:6, 38:7) or demons who took human form and married the daughters of human beings; 1 Peter 3:19–20; 2 Peter 2:4 [HYPERLINK: https://www.esv.org/2%20Pet.%202%3A4/], and Jude 6 [HYPERLINK: https://www.esv.org/Jude%206/] may be referring to this passage. (2) male descendants of Seth (the righteous, chosen family line) who married female descendants of Cain (the unrighteous family line). (3) sons of powerful men, such as judges or rulers (as in Exodus 22:8, Psalm 82:1, 6) who married the daughters of common, poor people.
GEN	6	2	g0oq		וַ⁠יִּרְא֤וּ אֶת בְּנ֣וֹת הָֽ⁠אָדָ֔ם כִּ֥י טֹבֹ֖ת הֵ֑נָּה	1	saw the daughters of mankind, that they {were} beautiful,	“saw that the daughters of human beings {were} beautiful,” or “saw that those young women {were} beautiful,” or “saw that they {were} {very} beautiful,”
GEN	6	2	flfn		וַ⁠יִּקְח֤וּ לָ⁠הֶם֙ נָשִׁ֔ים מִ⁠כֹּ֖ל אֲשֶׁ֥ר בָּחָֽרוּ	1	so they took wives for themselves from any {of them} that they chose.	“so they married any {of them} that they wanted to.” or “So they chose any/all {of them} that they wanted and married them.” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Also, see how you translated “took/married” in Gen 4:19.
GEN	6	3	n0aa	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר יְהוָ֗ה	1	Then Yahweh said,	“Then/So Yahweh said {to himself},” Only make implied information explicit in your translation if it is necessary to prevent wrong meaning or if your language’s grammar requires it, so that your translation is easier to read and understand. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	6	3	eeli		רוּחִ֤⁠י	1	“My Spirit	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean (1) “My Spirit” or “I”, which is a way of God referring to himself (Gen 1:2 is similar). (2) “My spirit”, which could refer to God’s breath that gives life (as in Gen 2:7). If the text is not translated literally, the literal text should be put in a footnote.
GEN	6	3	c4y1		לֹֽא יָד֨וֹן	1	will not	“will no longer”
GEN	6	3	b8es		יָד֨וֹן בָֽ⁠אָדָם֙	1	strive with	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) “strive/contend with” or “put up with” man’s rebellion (2) “remain/live with/in”. The interpretation that is not used in your translation could be put in a footnote.
GEN	6	3	o9l1		בָֽ⁠אָדָם֙	1	mankind	“human beings” or “people”
GEN	6	3	uruy	figs-infostructure	לְ⁠עֹלָ֔ם	1	forever,	“always,” It may be more natural to put this term earlier in this sentence and say, “My Spirit will not always strive with mankind,” Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	6	3	yiqg	figs-idiom	בְּ⁠שַׁ⁠גַּ֖ם ה֣וּא בָשָׂ֑ר	1	because they {are} indeed flesh.	“because they {are} certainly/very sinful/corrupt.” or “because they {are} only/mere {sinful/corrupt} mortals.” The word “flesh” is used here as an idiom that means human beings are “mortal” (that is, their bodies will die) and that they are “sinful/corrupt”. The two meanings are interrelated since it is because of sin that their bodies die. In this context, the focus is on their corrupt behavior, which is the reason God will send a flood soon. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	6	3	i22s		וְ⁠הָי֣וּ	1	Therefore	“So”. Many translations leave this word out. Do what is natural in your language.
GEN	6	3	ffux		וְ⁠הָי֣וּ יָמָ֔י⁠ו מֵאָ֥ה וְ⁠עֶשְׂרִ֖ים שָׁנָֽה	1	their days will be 120 years.”	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) ”they will have 120 years {to repent}.” or “I will give them 120 years {to repent}.” (2) “{from now on,} they/people will have/live {no longer than} 120 years.” The first interpretation seems to best fit the context of God announcing his plan to judge mankind for their sin (verse 7). This would mean that Noah was 480 years old when God said this (about 20 years before he started having sons; Gen 5:32), since the flood came when he was 600 years old (Gen 7:6); you could put some of that information in a footnote. The second interpretation does not fit with the fact that after God said this, many people lived much longer than 120 years, so it does not seem likely that length of life was his meaning here.
GEN	6	4	qpdi	translate-names	הַ⁠נְּפִלִ֞ים	1	The Nephilim	“{People called} the Nephilim” or “Giants”. Most translations transliterate (borrow or copy) the Hebrew word “Nephilim” here. The word means “fallen ones” and probably refers to their fallen (sinful) spiritual state. The Nephilim were the descendants of the sons of God and the daughters of mankind. The only other place in the Bible that the Nephilim are mentioned is centuries later in Numbers 13:32-33, where they are identified as evil giants. Based on that, some translations translate “the Nephilim” as “giants” here in Gen 6:4. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
GEN	6	4	mk8u		הָי֣וּ בָ⁠אָרֶץ֮	1	were on the earth	“lived on the earth” or “were living on the earth”

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	6	4	tq4l		כֵ֗ן אֲשֶׁ֨ר	1	when	“{That was/happened} when”. Consider whether or not it is better to begin a new sentence here in your language.
GEN	6	4	altz		בְּנֵ֤י הָֽ⁠אֱלֹהִים֙	1	the sons of God	“angels” or “supernatural beings”. Be consistent here with how you translated this phrase in verse 2, and see the important note about that there.
GEN	6	4	jqr1	figs-euphemism	יָבֹ֜אוּ אֶל	1	went to	“slept with” or “had {marital/sexual} relations with”. Translate this idiom in a way that is polite and will not shame or embarrass people when this verse is read aloud in public. See how you translated a similar idiom (“knew”) in Gen 4:1, 17, 25. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

GEN	6	4	xv2q		אַנְשֵׁ֥י הַ⁠שֵּֽׁם	1	the men of renown.	“{who/and were} famous men.” For some languages it may be more natural to put this phrase earlier in this sentence and say, “They {were} the mighty men of renown who...” or “They {were} the famous mighty men who....”
GEN	6	5	s9pe	figs-idiom	וַ⁠יַּ֣רְא יְהוָ֔ה	1	And Yahweh saw	“Yahweh knew” or “Yahweh was aware”. The verb “saw” is used here as an idiom. Consider whether your language has a similar idiom that would fit well here. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

And the idiom “in the eyes of” refers to someone’s opinion about something or someone. Consider whether your language has similar idioms that work well here or whether it is better to translate this sentence without an idiom. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

GEN	6	9	tihb	figs-idiom	תָּמִ֥ים הָיָ֖ה בְּ⁠דֹֽרֹתָ֑י⁠ו	1	He was without blemish in his generation.	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) “He {alone} was blameless/faultless {in God’s eyes} among his contemporaries.” or “Out of all the people living at that time, Noah/he was the only one {whom God considered} blameless.” (2) “He had a blameless/spotless reputation among his contemporaries. or “His contemporaries considered him to be a man of integrity.” The phrase “without blemish” is often used in the Bible to describe animals that have no defects. Here it is used as an idiom that means Noah was “blameless/faultless” in an ethical or moral sense, or that he had good integrity, but it does not mean that he was sinless. Consider whether your language has a similar idiom that would work well here. Also the word “generation” refers to people who live during the same time period. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	6	9	vwkc	figs-idiom	אֶת הָֽ⁠אֱלֹהִ֖ים הִֽתְהַלֶּךְ נֹֽחַ	1	Noah walked with God.	“{and} he walked {closely/faithfully} with God.” or “{and} he lived in a close/faithful relationship with God.” Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin a new sentence here. See how you translated this idiom in Gen 5:22, 24. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	6	10	r5ff		וַ⁠יּ֥וֹלֶד נֹ֖חַ	1	And Noah fathered	“Eventually Noah/he fathered/had {his}” or “And {as mentioned before,} Noah/he had”. The fact that Noah fathered/had these three sons was already mentioned in Gen 5:32. Make sure that the way you begin this verse in your translation does not sound like he fathered these sons a second time.
GEN	6	10	o027		שְׁלֹשָׁ֣ה בָנִ֑ים אֶת שֵׁ֖ם אֶת חָ֥ם וְ⁠אֶת יָֽפֶת	1	three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.	“three sons, {namely} Shem, Ham, and Japheth.” or “three sons, {whose names were} Shem, Ham, and Japheth.”
GEN	6	11	gv44	figs-metonymy	וַ⁠תִּשָּׁחֵ֥ת הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ	1	Now the earth	“Now {the people of/on} the earth”. The phrase “the earth” is often used in the Bible to refer to the people who live on the earth. Consider whether your language can do the same thing, or whether it is necessary to make that implied information explicit. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
GEN	6	11	xjwi		וַ⁠תִּשָּׁחֵ֥ת	1	was corrupt	“had become corrupt/wicked”
GEN	6	11	o1rm	figs-idiom	לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י הָֽ⁠אֱלֹהִ֑ים	1	before God,	“in God’s sight/opinion,” or “according to God’s standards,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	6	11	ioym	figs-parallelism	וַ⁠תִּמָּלֵ֥א הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ חָמָֽס	1	and the earth was filled {with} violence.	“and they had filled the earth with {their} violence/lawlessness.” or “and all over the earth they were doing violent/lawless things.” This clause forms a parallelism with the previous clause in order to emphasize how evil the people on the earth had become. The two clauses are different enough from each other that, if possible, it is best to keep both parts of the parallelism in your translation. Also be consistent with how you translated “the earth” earlier in this verse. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
GEN	6	12	vjes		וַ⁠יַּ֧רְא אֱלֹהִ֛ים	1	And God saw	“God saw”. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin this sentence with a conjunction.
GEN	6	12	imfe	figs-metonymy	אֶת הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ וְ⁠הִנֵּ֣ה נִשְׁחָ֑תָה	1	the earth, and behold, it was corrupt,	“that {everyone on} the earth was indeed/very corrupt/wicked,” or “how corrupt/wicked {everyone on} the earth had become,” See how you translated “corrupt” and “the earth” in verse 11. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
GEN	6	12	g5b4	figs-synecdoche	כִּֽי כָּל בָּשָׂ֛ר עַל הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	because all flesh on the earth	“because all the people on the earth” or “because everyone {living} on earth”. The phrase “all flesh” refers here to all people and probably implies that people are mortal (verse 3). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
GEN	6	12	rgxu		הִשְׁחִ֧ית אֶת דַּרְכּ֖⁠וֹ	1	had corrupted their ways.	“were living corrupt/wicked lives.” or “were {continually} doing wicked/evil things.” or “were {continually} acting/behaving in evil ways.”
GEN	6	13	o9w8		וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֜ים לְ⁠נֹ֗חַ	1	So God said to Noah,	“So/Then God/he said to Noah,”
GEN	6	13	xuqd	figs-synecdoche	קֵ֤ץ כָּל בָּשָׂר֙ בָּ֣א לְ⁠פָנַ֔⁠י	1	“The end of all flesh has come before me,	“I have decided to put an end to all human beings,” or “I am going to destroy all flesh/people,” Be consistent here with how you translated “flesh” in verse 12. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
GEN	6	13	q2w6		כִּֽי מָלְאָ֥ה הָ⁠אָ֛רֶץ חָמָ֖ס מִ⁠פְּנֵי⁠הֶ֑ם	1	because the earth is filled {with} violence because of them.	“because they have filled the earth with {their} violence/lawlessness.” or “because all over the earth they are doing violent/lawless things.” See how you translated “violence” in verse 11.
GEN	6	13	nzwh		וְ⁠הִנְ⁠נִ֥י	1	So behold,	“Now listen,” or “In fact,” This phrase draws extra attention to what God says next. Consider the best way to do that in your language.
GEN	6	13	g3q7		וְ⁠הִנְ⁠נִ֥י מַשְׁחִיתָ֖⁠ם	1	I am destroying them	“I am going to destroy them” or “I plan to destroy them” or “I will destroy”
GEN	6	13	gsn5	figs-metonym	אֶת הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	with the earth.	“as well as {everything else on} the earth.” or “and {everything else on} the earth {too}.” This phrase includes everything on the earth, not just the people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonym]])
GEN	6	14	n2ib	grammar-connect-logic-result	עֲשֵׂ֤ה	1	Make	“{Therefore/Consequently} {you must} make/build” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])
GEN	6	14	fw28	translate-transliterate	תֵּבַ֣ת	1	an ark	“a {very} large boat/houseboat”. The term “ark” is general and refers to a chest/box that is closed on all sides, including the top. In this case, the ark was a very large boat that people and many animals lived in for a year. It had no motor, no oars, no sail and no rudder. Since this was a unique, one-of-a-kind boat that may already be well-known as the “ark” in the receptor language area, some translations transliterate (copy or borrow) the word “ark” throughout Genesis. Decide what is best for your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])
GEN	6	14	bjsw	figs-explicit	לְ⁠ךָ֙	1	for yourself	“for you/yourself {and your family}” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	6	14	tc3w	translate-unknown	תֵּבַ֣ת עֲצֵי גֹ֔פֶר	1	out of gopher wood.	”from gopher/cypress wood {which is good for building boats}.” or “out of the best wood {for building boats}.” It is not certain what kind of wood this was, so many translations transliterate (copy or borrow) the Hebrew word “gopher”. Some Bible scholars think it was cypress wood. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
GEN	6	14	lr9y		קִנִּ֖ים תַּֽעֲשֶׂ֣ה אֶת הַ⁠תֵּבָ֑ה	1	Make the ark {with} rooms,	“Build/Construct the ark/boat with compartments/stalls {inside},” or “Make/Build rooms inside the ark/boat,”
GEN	6	14	jh35		וְ⁠כָֽפַרְתָּ֥ אֹתָ֛⁠הּ מִ⁠בַּ֥יִת וּ⁠מִ⁠ח֖וּץ	1	and cover it inside and outside	“and {completely} seal/coat it inside and outside”
GEN	6	14	zm4j		בַּ⁠כֹּֽפֶר	1	with a covering.	“with pitch/tar {to keep water out}.” or “with pitch/tar {to keep the boat from leaking}.” The Hebrew word “covering” is general and does not specify what kind of waterproofing material is being used. However, many translations are more specific than that here and refer to “pitch” or “tar” or some other material made from tree resin or sap that can seal a boat well and keep it from leaking.
GEN	6	15	gd2b		וְ⁠זֶ֕ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר תַּֽעֲשֶׂ֖ה אֹתָ֑⁠הּ	1	And this {is} how you must make it:	“Build the ark/boat with these dimensions/measurements:” or “You must make/build the ark/boat like this:”

You can (1) translate cubits into meters or feet, and put the literal text in a footnote; or (2) keep “cubits” in the main text (so that the numbers 300, 50 and 30 are kept) and put what that equals in meters or feet in a footnote. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bdistance]])
GEN	6	16	xf0o	translate-bdistance	צֹ֣הַר תַּֽעֲשֶׂ֣ה לַ⁠תֵּבָ֗ה וְ⁠אֶל אַמָּה֙ תְּכַלֶ֣⁠נָּה מִ⁠לְ⁠מַ֔עְלָ⁠ה	1	Make a window for the ark and finish it to within one cubit from the top.	“Make/Build a window/skylight for the ark/boat by finishing {the sides/walls of} the ark/boat to within one cubit below the top/roof {of the ark/boat}.” or “Make/Build a half-meter high window/opening between the top of the walls/sides of the ark and its roof {all the way around}, {to let light and air in}.” The meaning of the Hebrew text is not completely certain here, but God was probably telling Noah to make a one-cubit high window or opening at the top of the outside walls of the ark, just below the roof, all the way around the ark, to let light and air into the ark. See the note about “cubit” in verse 15. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bdistance]])
GEN	6	16	iu3g	grammar-connect-words-phrases	וּ⁠פֶ֥תַח הַ⁠תֵּבָ֖ה בְּ⁠צִדָּ֣⁠הּ תָּשִׂ֑ים	1	And put the door of the ark in its side.	“Also put/build a door in the side of the ark/boat.” or “Put/Build a door for the ark/boat in its side.” Some translations begin this sentence without a conjunction (“And” or “Also”). Do what is natural in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
GEN	6	16	py2a		תַּחְתִּיִּ֛ם שְׁנִיִּ֥ם וּ⁠שְׁלִשִׁ֖ים תַּֽעֲשֶֽׂ⁠הָ	0	Make a lower, a second, and a third {deck}.	“Make/Build a lower {deck/level}, a middle {deck/level}, and an upper {deck/level} {on the inside}.” or “{and} make/build a lower, second/middle, and third/upper story/floor {on the inside}.” or “{and} make/build three {complete} levels/floors {on the inside}.” Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin a new sentence here.
GEN	6	17	i4c0		וַ⁠אֲנִ֗י הִנְ⁠נִי֩	1	And behold me,	“Behold me,” or “Listen {carefully} to me,”
GEN	6	17	j1ln	figs-pronouns	וַ⁠אֲנִ֗י מֵבִ֨יא עַל הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	I am bringing floodwaters on the earth	“I am going to bring/send a flood on/over the {whole/entire} earth” or “I {myself} am going to flood the {whole/entire} earth {with water}”. In the Hebrew text, the pronoun “I” is emphatic, both by its form and by its position at the beginning of the sentence. If it is clear and natural in your language, keep that emphasis in your translation of this clause. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns]])
GEN	6	17	drko		לְ⁠שַׁחֵ֣ת	1	to destroy	“{in order} to destroy” or “which will destroy”. See how you translated “destroy” in verse 13.
GEN	6	17	kx0b		כָּל בָּשָׂ֗ר	1	all flesh	“all the creatures/beings” or “every creature” or “every living thing”. This phrase is general here and includes people and animals, so you may need to translate the phrase differently here from what you did earlier in verses 12-13 (where the focus seems to be on people).
GEN	6	17	kbuc		אֲשֶׁר בּ⁠וֹ֙ ר֣וּחַ חַיִּ֔ים	1	that {has} the breath of life in it	“that breathe/breathes {air}”. See how you translated this phrase in Gen 1:30.
GEN	6	17	ynax	figs-infostructure	מִ⁠תַּ֖חַת הַ⁠שָּׁמָ֑יִם	1	from under the heavens.	“from under the sky.” It may be clearer to put this phrase earlier in this sentence and say, “to destroy every living thing under the heavens/sky that has the breath of life in it.” Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	6	17	m0z4		כֹּ֥ל אֲשֶׁר בָּ⁠אָ֖רֶץ	1	Everything that {is} on the earth	“{As a result,} every {living} thing/being that {is/lives} on land“
GEN	6	17	acta	figs-idiom	יִגְוָֽע	1	will expire!	“will breathe out {its last breath}!” or “will die/perish!” The verb “expire” (which could also be translated “exhale” or “breathe out”) is used here as an idiom that means “die”. Consider whether your language has a similar or different idiom that would work well here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	6	18	wc2k	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וַ⁠הֲקִמֹתִ֥י	1	But I will establish	“But/However I will make/institute” or “But/However I will set up”. The word “establish” means to deliberately and formally put something into effect. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
GEN	6	18	xt72	translate-key-terms	אֶת בְּרִיתִ֖⁠י אִתָּ֑⁠ךְ	1	my covenant with you,	“a covenant between me and you,” or “a {special/peace} agreement between me and you,” This covenant is made up of the unconditional, unbreakable promises that God made to Noah (and all mankind and all other living things) in Genesis 8:2-9:17. The word “testament” is another word for “covenant,” so the way you translate “covenant” here could be similar to the way you translate the titles “Old Testament” and “New Testament.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms]])
GEN	6	18	ri6o		וּ⁠בָאתָ֙ אֶל הַ⁠תֵּבָ֔ה	1	so you must go into the ark,	“so you must enter the ark/boat,” or “so you must get on board the ark/boat,”

GEN	6	21	fvsq	figs-yousingular	וְ⁠אַתָּ֣ה	1	And you	“You” or “You {and your family}”. Although the pronoun “you” is singular in the Hebrew text in verse 21, it could be translated as plural, since God’s instructions apply to Noah and his family, not just Noah. Or you could make his family explicit. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])

It may be necessary to include a footnote that explains the concept of clean and unclean animals: In the Bible a “clean animal” was an animal that was acceptable to be sacrificed to God or to be eaten, and an “unclean animal” was one that could not be sacrificed or eaten; it does not refer to how clean the animal was physically. Later Moses wrote down the laws about clean and unclean animals in the book of Leviticus.

GEN	7	4	dkg7		לְ⁠יָמִ֨ים ע֜וֹד שִׁבְעָ֗ה	1	in seven more days	“seven days from now/today”. The phrase, “seven more days” could be translated “another week” here and in verse 11. However, it is probably best to keep the number seven in the text in both places, especially since the number seven often signifies perfection or completion in the Bible, perhaps also here.

GEN	7	8	boeg		וְ⁠כֹ֥ל אֲשֶׁר רֹמֵ֖שׂ עַל הָֽ⁠אֲדָמָֽה	1	and everything that moves on the ground	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean (1) “including every {kind of} creature/animal that moves/lives on land” or “which includes every {kind of} creature/animal that moves/lives on land“. According to this interpretation, the rest of verse 8 emphasizes that the clean and unclean animals and birds (verses 2-3, 8) were all creatures that lived on land (which are the creatures that the flood affected). (2) “as well as every {kind of} creature/animal that crawls/creeps along the ground”. According to this interpretation, the rest of verse 8 refers to a fourth category of creatures besides the clean animals, unclean animals, and birds.

GEN	7	10	vagz		וַֽ⁠יְהִ֖י	1	And it happened,	“So it happened {that}” or “Then”. This phrase focuses attention on an important event (the beginning of the flood), and it builds suspense so that readers and listeners wonder what will happen next.

It does not mean seven days after Noah and the animals went into the ark (verses 7-9); they went into the ark on the same day that the flood started (verse 13). Translate the beginning of this sentence in a way that makes that clear. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

GEN	7	14	i5er		וְ⁠כָל הַֽ⁠חַיָּ֣ה לְ⁠מִינָ֗⁠הּ וְ⁠כָל	1	every living thing according to its kind, and	In the Hebrew text this phrase is ambiguous. It can mean (1) “every kind of living thing/creature, including” (2) “every kind of wild animal, and”. The animal groups listed in verse 14 show that every kind of animal was to be brought onto the ark. Your language may have a different way of grouping animals. Make sure it is clear in your translation of this verse that all the different kinds of birds and land animals are included.

The phrase “God remembered” is an idiom in the Bible that often means God was paying special attention to certain people and was about to do something. Make sure that the way you translate this phrase does not imply that God had forgotten about Noah. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	8	1	trtz	figs-explicit	אֶת נֹ֔חַ	1	Noah	“Noah {and his family}”. Noah is the one that the author is focusing on here, but Noah’s family is also included. Consider whether or not you need to make that explicit in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	8	1	x721		NO OrigLQuote AVAILABLE!!!	0	and all the living creature{s} and	In the Hebrew text this phrase is ambiguous. It can mean (1) “and all the wild animals and” (2) “and all the creatures/animals, including”. See how you translated “living creature” in Gen 1:24-25 and 7:14.

Also make sure it is clear in your translation that the 150 days mentioned here in Gen 8:3 are the same 150 days mentioned in Gen 7:24, not two different periods of time.

Some translations leave this phrase out, but that loses some of the suspense. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
GEN	8	6	ybqv		וַ⁠יִּפְתַּ֣ח נֹ֔חַ אֶת חַלּ֥וֹן	1	Noah opened the window	“Noah opened a window”. It is not clear when Noah made this window. It may refer to the opening around the top of the walls of the ark (Gen 6:16) or a different window that he made sometime later.

For languages such as English that do not assign grammatical gender to nouns, it is more accurate to use “its” and “it” here, because it is not known whether this dove was male or female.

GEN	8	14	befv		יָבְשָׁ֖ה	1	was dry.	“had dried off.” In this context “dry” means that the ground was dry enough to walk on and live on without getting stuck in mud. Make sure your translation does not imply that it was so dry that nothing would grow on it (like a desert).

It can mean (1) “and every {other} creature/animal that moves/lives”, which seems to fit this context best since it is general and includes all the land animals that were not birds or livestock. (2) “and every creature/animal that crawls”, which is more specific and refers to animals like lizards, snakes, mice, and other animals that have bodies that are close to the ground.

Make sure your translation does not sound like this refers to separate events. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
GEN	8	17	ndas		וּ⁠פָר֥וּ	1	be fruitful	“have many offspring/young”
GEN	8	17	n5t4		וְ⁠רָב֖וּ	1	and multiply	“and increase {in number}” or “and become {very} numerous/many”. See how you translated “be fruitful” and “multiply” in Gen 1:22, 28.
GEN	8	17	r38i		עַל הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	over the earth.”	“{all} over the earth/world.” or “throughout the earth.”
GEN	8	18	rd55	figs-go	וַ⁠יֵּ֖צֵא נֹ֑חַ	1	Then Noah went out,	“Then/So Noah went/came out {of the ark/boat},” or “Then/So Noah disembarked {from the ark/boat},” or “Then/So Noah got off {the ark/boat},” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])

Notice that the order of the people in this list varies in the Hebrew text, perhaps depending on who is in focus in each context.
GEN	8	19	um3f		כָּל הַֽ⁠חַיָּ֗ה	1	Every living thing,	“Every living creature,” or “All the animals,”
GEN	8	19	hbpk		כָּל הָ⁠רֶ֨מֶשׂ֙	1	every crawling thing	“{including} every animal/creature that crawls” or “{including} all the animals/creatures that crawl”

GEN	8	19	bokj		רוֹמֵ֣שׂ עַל הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	moving on the earth,	“that moves/lives on the ground,” or “that lives on land,” This phrase refers here to the land, not the entire planet earth. See how you translated this phrase in verse 17.
GEN	8	19	f9c6	figs-go	יָצְא֖וּ	1	went out	“{also} went/came out”. Consider again how you translated “go/come out” and “went/came out” and “bring/take out” in verses 16-19. Notice that your choices are affected by your perspective: whether the viewpoint is from inside the ark or whether the viewpoint is from outside the ark. Do what is natural in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-go]])
GEN	8	19	lk19		לְ⁠מִשְׁפְּחֹ֣תֵי⁠הֶ֔ם	1	by their families.	“{grouped} by their kinds.” or “in groups of their own kind.” or “one family/kind after another.”

In the Bible, a “clean” animal or bird is one that is acceptable to be sacrificed to God or eaten; it does not refer to how clean the animal or bird was physically. See how you translated this term in Gen 7:2, 8.
GEN	8	20	nefm	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יַּ֥עַל עֹלֹ֖ת בַּ⁠מִּזְבֵּֽחַ	1	and offered burnt offerings on the altar.	“and he {killed them and} offered/sacrificed them as burnt offerings {to Yahweh} on the altar.” or “and he {killed them and} burned {their bodies} on the altar as offerings/gifts {to Yahweh} {to worship/honor/thank him}.” Notice that animals were not burned alive, but were killed first. Consider whether or not you need to make that information explicit in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	8	21	v8oa		וַ⁠יָּ֣רַח יְהוָה֮ אֶת רֵ֣יחַ הַ⁠נִּיחֹחַ֒	1	And Yahweh smelled the pleasant aroma,	“Yahweh smelled the pleasant/sweet aroma/smell {of the sacrifices},” or “When Yahweh smelled the aroma {of the sacrifices}, he was pleased,”
GEN	8	21	l92v	writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר יְהוָ֜ה	1	and Yahweh	“and/so he”. Consider what is the best way to refer to Yahweh here in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	8	21	eo25	figs-idiom	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר אֶל לִבּ֗⁠וֹ	1	said in his heart,	“said/thought to himself,” Consider whether your language has this idiom or a similar idiom that would work well here, or whether it is better to translate this without an idiom. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	8	21	f7gu	translate-key-terms	לֹֽא אֹ֠סִף לְ⁠קַלֵּ֨ל אֶת הָֽ⁠אֲדָמָה֙	1	“Never again will I curse the ground	“I will never again curse/devastate the ground/earth”. Make sure that your translation of “curse” does not imply the use of magic. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms]])

GEN	8	21	qrhp	figs-idiom	לְ⁠הַכּ֥וֹת	1	strike	“destroy/annihilate/kill”. Consider whether your language has this idiom or a similar idiom that fits well here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

GEN	8	22	gvwi	figs-parallelism	וְ⁠קֹ֨ר וָ⁠חֹ֜ם	1	and cold and heat,	“cold {weather/season} and hot {weather/season},” These terms form a parallelism with “summer and winter”. If possible, it is best to keep both parts of the parallelism in your translation, since each part has a different emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
GEN	8	22	ykm2		וְ⁠קַ֧יִץ וָ⁠חֹ֛רֶף	1	and summer and winter,	“summer and winter,” The seasons of summer and winter may be described differently depending on which part of the world your language area is located in. For example, some translations might use the terms “dry season” and “rainy/wet season”, depending on what best corresponds to summer and winter in that area.
GEN	8	22	btlc	figs-infostructure	לֹ֥א יִשְׁבֹּֽתוּ	1	will not cease.”	“will never cease/stop.” or “will always continue {to happen/occur} {each year}.” It may be more natural to change the order of this sentence and say, “As long as the earth exists, {each year} there will always be a season/time to plant seeds and a season/time to harvest {crops}, as well as cold weather and hot weather, winter and summer, and day and night.” Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])

GEN	9	1	zstr	writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֧אמֶר לָ⁠הֶ֛ם	1	and said to them,	“by saying to them,” or “by saying,” or “He said,” The phrase “blessed…and said” is a Hebrew expression that refers to one event and emphasizes it. It does not refer to two separate events. The words of the blessing are in verses 1-7. See how you translated this phrase in Gen 1:28. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	9	1	dgp6	figs-idiom	פְּר֥וּ	1	“Be fruitful	“Bear/Have many children” or “You will bear/have many children” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

See how you translated “be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth” in Gen 1:28. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal]])
GEN	9	1	kiu7		וּ⁠מִלְא֥וּ אֶת הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	and fill the earth.	“and fill the earth {with people}.” or “and inhabit the whole earth.” or “and live/spread all over the earth/world.”

For some languages it may be better to combine the phrase and say “very afraid/terrified”. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
GEN	9	2	xvdx		וְ⁠עַ֖ל כָּל ע֣וֹף	1	including on every bird	“including every bird” or “including all the birds”. The birds, moving creatures, and fish are all included in the general category of living creatures.
GEN	9	2	ww6w		ע֣וֹף הַ⁠שָּׁמָ֑יִם	1	of the sky,	“{that flies/fly} in the sky/air,” Consider again how you translated “birds of the sky” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 1:26, 28, 30; 2:19-20; 6:7; 7:3, 23; 9:2.
GEN	9	2	d22j		בְּ⁠כֹל֩ אֲשֶׁ֨ר תִּרְמֹ֧שׂ	1	on everything that moves	“and every creature/animal that moves/lives” or “as well as all creatures/animals that move/live”

GEN	9	2	q3ev	figs-idiom	בְּ⁠יֶדְ⁠כֶ֥ם נִתָּֽנוּ	1	Into your hand they are given.	“I have put them {all} under your authority.” or “I have put you in charge of them {all}.” The phrase “into your hand” means God was again giving mankind the responsibility to manage and control all the rest of what God had created. Consider whether your language has a similar idiom that would work well here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	9	3	v7rp		כָּל רֶ֨מֶשׂ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר הוּא חַ֔י	1	Every moving creature that lives	“{From now on} every {kind of} living creature/thing that moves” or “{From now on} every creature/animal that is alive and moves”. See how you translated “every moving creature” in Gen 1:26, and see the note about that there. It may be necessary to translate this phrase in different ways in different contexts.
GEN	9	3	wqwa	figs-infostructure	לָ⁠כֶ֥ם יִהְיֶ֖ה לְ⁠אָכְלָ֑ה	1	will be for you for food.	“is yours {to eat} as food.” or “is available for you {to eat} as food.” For some languages it is more natural to change the order of this sentence and say, “You may {now} have/eat any {kind of} living creature that moves, for food.” or “{I now permit} you to eat every/any {kind of} living creature that moves.” Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	9	3	dk9i	figs-ellipsis	כְּ⁠יֶ֣רֶק	1	Just as	“Just as {in the past} {I gave/provided you}” or “In the same way that {I previously gave/provided you}”. The Hebrew text leaves the verb implied here. Decide whether or not to make it explicit in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis]])
GEN	9	3	rirx		כְּ⁠יֶ֣רֶק עֵ֔שֶׂב	1	the green plants,	“green plants {for food},” or “plants {to eat},” Consider again how you translated “green plants” in Gen 1:30, and how you translated “plants” in Gen 1:11-12, 29; 2:5; 3:18; 9:3.
GEN	9	3	x2ps		נָתַ֥תִּי לָ⁠כֶ֖ם אֶת כֹּֽל	1	I give you everything.	“{now} I give/provide you everything {for food}.” or “{so now} I permit you to eat everything.” or “{so now} I permit you to eat both plants and animals.” Make sure that the way you translate this phrase means that God is now permitting people to eat both plants and animals.
GEN	9	4	iav6	grammar-connect-exceptions	אַךְ	1	But	“However,” God is putting a limit on the way that people may eat meat. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions]])

GEN	9	4	mhsx		בְּ⁠נַפְשׁ֥⁠וֹ דָמ֖⁠וֹ	1	its life, {that is,} its blood.	“its life {in it}, {which is in} its blood.” or “its blood {in it}, which made it live.” or “its lifeblood {in it}.” Since life is in the blood, God did not want people to eat meat that still had its blood in it, rather he wanted them to drain it out first before they cooked it (also see Deuteronomy 12:16, 23). You could put that information in a footnote.
GEN	9	5	h62s		וְ⁠אַ֨ךְ אֶת דִּמְ⁠כֶ֤ם לְ⁠נַפְשֹֽׁתֵי⁠כֶם֙ אֶדְרֹ֔שׁ	1	And surely I will demand your blood for your lives.	“Also, I will definitely require an accounting/reckoning for your lifeblood.” or “Also, if {one of} you murders anyone, I definitely require that he must die.”
GEN	9	5	onru	figs-synecdoche	מִ⁠יַּ֥ד כָּל חַיָּ֖ה	1	From the hand of every living thing	“From every/any animal {that kills a person}” or “{In fact,} if any animal {kills a human being},” In this verse, the phrase “the hand of” refers to the animal or the person that is responsible for killing someone. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
GEN	9	5	bkop		אֶדְרְשֶׁ֑⁠נּוּ	1	I will demand it,	“I will demand/require its blood/life,” or “I require it to be killed,” or “I demand/require that it must die,”
GEN	9	5	guod		וּ⁠מִ⁠יַּ֣ד הָֽ⁠אָדָ֗ם	1	and from the hand of mankind;	“{That is also true} for human beings:” or “and {that is also true} for human beings.” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
GEN	9	5	bw3t		מִ⁠יַּד֙ אִ֣ישׁ	1	from the hand of a man {who kills}	“If a man/person {kills/murders}” or “If anyone {kills/murders}”
GEN	9	5	lzts	figs-synecdoche	אָחִ֔י⁠ו	1	his brother,	“his/a fellow human being,” or “another person,” This phrase is used here as a general reference to any human being, not just biological brothers. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
GEN	9	5	snn4		אֶדְרֹ֖שׁ אֶת נֶ֥פֶשׁ הָֽ⁠אָדָֽם	1	I will demand the life of the man.	“I require him to be executed/killed.” or “I demand/require that he must die.”
GEN	9	6	jfaq		שֹׁפֵךְ֙	1	The one	“{That’s right,} whoever” or “{Yes/Indeed,} if anyone/someone”. The first half of verse 6 repeats and summarizes verse 5.
GEN	9	6	hcug	figs-idiom	שֹׁפֵךְ֙ דַּ֣ם	1	shedding the blood of	“spills the blood of” or “kills/murders” or “takes the life of”. The phrase “sheds the blood of” is an idiom that means to deliberately kill someone. Blood is an important concept in this passage and throughout the Bible, so if possible it is best to keep this term in a translation. If that is not possible, you should put the literal text in a footnote. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	9	6	gh33		הָֽ⁠אָדָ֔ם	1	a man,	“a person,” or “another human being,” or “someone,”
GEN	9	6	ohya	figs-infostructure	בָּֽ⁠אָדָ֖ם דָּמ֣⁠וֹ יִשָּׁפֵ֑ךְ	1	by mankind his blood must be shed,	“people/you must execute him,” or “people/you must put him to death,” or “he must be executed,” For some languages it is more natural to put this clause first in this verse and say, “{That’s right,} you must put to death anyone who murders a human being, because {I,} God, made human beings in my own image.” Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	9	6	dndc		כִּ֚י בְּ⁠צֶ֣לֶם אֱלֹהִ֔ים עָשָׂ֖ה אֶת הָ⁠אָדָֽם	1	because in the image of God he made mankind.	“because {I,} God made/created mankind/people in my {own} image.” or “because I created human beings to be like myself.” Make sure it is clear in your translation that God is referring to himself in this clause. See how you translated a similar clause in Gen 1:27.
GEN	9	7	c807		וְ⁠אַתֶּ֖ם	1	And you,	“And/Now {as for} you,” or “As for you,” The pronoun “you” is an emphatic pronoun that is fronted here in the Hebrew text to introduce a new topic. Consider what is the best way in your language to begin a new paragraph like this.
GEN	9	7	o9nc	figs-idiom	פְּר֣וּ	1	be fruitful	“bear/have many children”. See how you translated “be fruitful and multiply” in verse 1. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

This phrase emphasizes what he says next to them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	9	9	aqhq		וַ⁠אֲנִ֕י הִנְנִ֥⁠י	0	“And I, behold,	“Now listen {carefully} to me:” or “Listen {carefully} to me,” See how you translated “behold” in Gen 1:29, 4:14, 6:13, 17. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.
GEN	9	9	kh9v		הִנְנִ֥⁠י מֵקִ֛ים	1	I am establishing	“I am making/instituting” or “I am setting up”. See how you translated “establish my covenant with” in Gen 6:18, and see the note about that there.
GEN	9	9	febx		אֶת בְּרִיתִ֖⁠י אִתְּ⁠כֶ֑ם וְ⁠אֶֽת זַרְעֲ⁠כֶ֖ם אַֽחֲרֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	my covenant with you and with your offspring after you,	“my/a {special/peace} covenant/agreement with you and your offspring/descendants {who come/live} after you,” or “my/a covenant/agreement between me and you and your offspring/descendants,” Notice that the pronouns “you” and “your” are plural throughout verses 2-15, since God is speaking to Noah and his sons.
GEN	9	10	bi84		וְ⁠אֵ֨ת	1	and with	“along with” or “{It is} also with” or “{The covenant/agreement is} also with”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to break up this long sentence and begin a new sentence here.
GEN	9	10	dkbb		כָּל נֶ֤פֶשׁ הַֽ⁠חַיָּה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר אִתְּ⁠כֶ֔ם	1	every living creature that {is} with you:	“all the living creatures that {are} with you:”

GEN	9	10	chzz		וּֽ⁠בְ⁠כָל חַיַּ֥ת	1	every living thing	“all the living things/creatures” or “all the creatures/animals”
GEN	9	10	ap14		חַיַּ֥ת הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ	1	of the earth.	“{that live} on the earth.” or “{that will ever live} on the earth.”

See how you translated a similar clause in verse 12. In that verse God is explaining the rainbow for the first time, whereas here in verse 17, he is pointing back to what he just said about the rainbow in order to emphasize its importance. Also, consider again how you translated “covenant” in verses 9, 11-13, 15-17. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms]])

The pronoun “he” is emphatic here, emphasizing that Ham was the father of Canaan, who is probably mentioned here because he was well known as the ancestor of the Canaanites and the one whom the land/region of Canaan was named after.

If necessary, you could make that explicit here. Also, if grapes are not known in your language area, you could say “vines/plants with a fruit called grapes”, or you could put in a footnote information about grapes, including how they are squeezed and how the juice is fermented to make wine.

GEN	9	25	mt38		עֶ֥בֶד עֲבָדִ֖ים	1	a slave of slaves	“the lowest slave/servant”. The Hebrew word here can mean either “slave” or “servant”. Slaves in the Old Testament were usually treated well and were not much different than servants, sometimes even becoming like members of their owner’s family. But they were of lower status than their masters, so that is part of how Ham’s family is being cursed.
GEN	9	25	vvrh		לְ⁠אֶחָֽי⁠ו	1	for his brothers.”	“for his/Canaan’s relatives.” Verses 26 and 27 show that “his brothers” probably refers here to Shem and Japheth (who were Canaan’s uncles) and their descendants.

GEN	11	1	s29r	figs-metonymy	כָל הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ	1	the whole earth	“all {the people on} the earth” or “everyone on the earth” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

Consider the best way to communicate that in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
GEN	11	2	kj0i	writing-newevent	וַֽ⁠יְהִ֖י בְּ⁠נָסְעָ֣⁠ם	1	And it happened as	“After a while, as/when” or “As/When” or “As time passed,” The phrase “it happened that” introduces an important event and helps create suspense so that readers will wonder what the outcome will be. Some translations omit this phrase because it is not natural in their language. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
GEN	11	2	hzev	writing-pronouns	בְּ⁠נָסְעָ֣⁠ם	1	they migrated	“they moved/traveled” or “the people migrated/moved”. Consider whether it is better in your language to use a pronoun (“they”) or a noun phrase (“the people”) here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	11	2	cg4r		מִ⁠קֶּ֑דֶם	1	from the east,	“from the eastern {regions},” or “{around} in the eastern {regions},” At first after the flood, people lived in the regions around the mountains of Ararat (where the ark had landed). As they began to migrate and spread out to different places (as God had told them to do), they must have headed south at some point, since they ended up at the plain of Shinar, which was south of where the Ararat Mountains were. The reference to “the east” probably reflects the viewpoint of the author (Moses), since the Ararat mountains and the plain of Shinar were both far to the east of where he was living.
GEN	11	2	qder		וַֽ⁠יִּמְצְא֥וּ	1	then they found	“they discovered” or “they {eventually} came to” or “and {eventually} came to”. Make sure the way you translate this phrase fits with the way you translated the first half of this verse.

GEN	11	2	mtdn		וַ⁠יֵּ֥שְׁבוּ שָֽׁם	1	and settled there.	“and lived/stayed there.” or “and began to live there.”
GEN	11	3	gdqz		וַ⁠יֹּאמְר֞וּ	1	Then they said to each other,	“Then {one day} they urged each other,” The events that are described below probably did not happen immediately after they arrived at the plain. Consider what is the best way to begin these events in your language. (See: writing-new event)
GEN	11	3	uq6q	figs-idiom	הָ֚בָ⁠ה	1	“Come,	“Come on,” Consider whether or not your language has an idiom like this that is used to urge or persuade someone to do something together. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	11	3	ofhm	figs-exclusive	נִלְבְּנָ֣ה	1	let us make	“let us {work together and} make” or “we should {work together and} make”. The pronoun “us” is inclusive here and refers to the people who are talking to each other. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

The phrase “make a name for ourselves” is a idiom. Consider whether or not your language has a similar idiom that would work well here. Also see how you translated the word “scattered” in Gen 10:18, 32. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	11	4	qt6a	figs-idiom	עַל פְּנֵ֥י כָל הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	over the face of the whole earth.”	“all over the earth/world.” or “around the world.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

Consider what is the best way to translate this in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives]])
GEN	11	7	m7n2		הָ֚בָ⁠ה	1	Come,	“{So} come on,” or “{So}”
GEN	11	7	m3d1		נֵֽרְדָ֔ה	1	let us	“we must”. Most Bible scholars think this plural pronoun refers here to God and the fact that he is three Persons in one God. So it is best to keep this plural pronoun in your translation. See what you did for similar pronouns in Gen 1:26.
GEN	11	7	i8vd		נֵֽרְדָ֔ה וְ⁠נָבְלָ֥ה שָׁ֖ם	1	go down and there	“go down there {now} and” or “go to them and”

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])

GEN	11	9	jqav		קָרָ֤א שְׁמָ⁠הּ֙	1	they called its name	“people named the/that city” or “the name of the/that city is” or “the/that city was named/called”. Frequently in the Hebrew text, this phrase has a general meaning and does not refer to someone specific.
GEN	11	9	q9xv		בָּבֶ֔ל	1	Babel,	“Babel, {which means “confused/mixed-up/scrambled,”}” If you include the meaning of “Babel” here in your translation or in a footnote, be consistent with the way you translate “confused” later in this verse and in verse 7.

Also be consistent here with how you spelled “Arpachshad/Arphaxad” in Gen 10:22. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])

In fact, Abram was not born until Terah was at least 130 years old (11:32, 12:4-5; Acts 7:4), and he was probably Terah’s youngest son. Abram is listed first (instead of Haran or Nahor) probably because of his importance as the one whom Yahweh made His covenant with. Some of this information could be put in a footnote.

This phrase refers to Abram and his descendants, including ultimately the Messiah. In other words, God’s promise in this verse is part of his wonderful news (the Gospel message) for all people (Galatians 3:8-9) and is a prophecy about the Messiah/Christ, who was one of Abraham’s descendants (Matthew 1:1, Genesis 22:18, Galatians 3:16). God blessed all people on earth by sending his Son Jesus (the Messiah/Christ) to die in their place and pay for all their sins (John 3:16-18, 1 Timothy 2:3-6), so that they could have a close relationship with him/God and be part of his family forever. God repeats this great promise in Genesis 18:18; 22:18; 26:4; 28:14. You could put some of that information in a footnote. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])

A terebinth tree is a large, broadleaf, flowering tree in the cashew family that can grow to a height of 5 to 12 meters (16 to 40 feet). The Hebrew words for “oak” and “terebinth” are similar, so many translations (including LXX) translate this as “oak tree” here. Notice, however, that oak trees and terebinth trees are from two different tree families. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

GEN	12	9	jyvm	translate-names	הַ⁠נֶּֽגְבָּ⁠ה	1	the Negev.	“the Negev/Southern {Wilderness/Desert}.” The Hebrew word “Negev” can mean “south” or “dry country,” so some translations translate the meaning. But most translations transliterate the Hebrew name (as “Negev” or “Negeb”) as they do with other names in the Bible. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
GEN	12	10	pvb5		וַ⁠יְהִ֥י	1	Then there was	“Now there was”. This clause gives the setting for the rest of the sentence. Translate this in a way that is natural in your language.
GEN	12	10	ofam		רָעָ֖ב	1	a famine	“a serious/extreme shortage/lack of food” or “a hungry/starving time when food was very/extremely scarce”. A “famine” is a prolonged period of time when people are starving because crops are failing, often due to a lack of rain or other severe weather conditions.

GEN	12	10	bmho		וַ⁠יֵּ֨רֶד	1	went down	“headed/traveled southwest” or “went/traveled/moved {further} south”. This phrase refers to the fact that Egypt is lower in elevation than Canaan (verse 5). It is also located southwest of Canaan.

Do what is best in your language.

GEN	12	14	jw8l	figs-explicit	כְּ⁠ב֥וֹא אַבְרָ֖ם	1	when Abram	“When Abram {and his family}”. Although Abram is in focus here, your translation should not sound like he was traveling alone. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Also, the term “Pharaoh” is a title that refers to the king or ruler over Egypt. However, in the Old Testament, it is treated as a name (that frequently occurs with the title “king of Egypt”), so translators often transliterate “Pharaoh” (which is how other names in the Bible are normally treated). Decide how you will handle this in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

The reason Abraham is the only one mentioned in this clause and in the next sentence is that he is in focus. He did not travel alone and he probably did not chop the wood alone. Decide whether you need to make that explicit in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	22	3	etcs	figs-abstractnouns	עֲצֵ֣י עֹלָ֔ה	1	for the burnt offering.	“{to use} for the burnt offering {and loaded it on the donkey}.” or “that they would use to burn the sacrifice/offering {and loaded it on the donkey}.” Some languages must translate this noun phrase using a verb.

In this context, “got up” is used as an idiom that means Abraham started an activity. It does not mean that he was sitting down and literally stood up. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

We do not know for sure how old Isaac was at this time, but estimates range between 18 and 37 years old. Make sure your translation of “boy” allows for that fact.

GEN	22	6	pb40		אֶת הָ⁠אֵ֖שׁ	1	the fire	“a fire pot {with hot coals in it}” or “the {other} things to make/start a fire”. The “fire” can either refer to hot coals (in a pot) or to a flint stone and wood chips that they would use to start the fire on the altar. Make sure that the way you translate this does not mean that Abraham was holding fire or hot coals in his bare hands.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	22	11	fbjd		וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֨א	1	But	“But {just then}” or “But {before he/Abraham could use the knife,}” Make sure in your translation that it does not sound like Abraham killed Isaac.
GEN	22	11	jwn7		מַלְאַ֤ךְ יְהוָה֙	1	an angel of Yahweh	“an angel from Yahweh” or “one of Yahweh’s angels”. See how you translated “an angel of Yahweh” in Gen 21:17.

The angel repeats the previous command using different words in order to emphasize that Abraham should not hurt Isaac. Most languages can do something similar. Do what is natural in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
GEN	22	12	b4m7		כִּ֣י עַתָּ֣ה יָדַ֗עְתִּי	1	because now I know	“Now I know/see” or “You have shown me”. Yahweh is the one talking here, represented by the angel who speaks on his behalf, or perhaps God is appearing to Abraham as an angel.

Animals that were sacrificed to God as burnt offerings were killed first before they were burned on an altar. Make sure your translation does not sound like the ram was burned alive. If that is not clear, you could make some of the above implied information explicit in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

There will be so many that no one can count them all (as in Gen 13:16 and 15:6). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

Also consider whether it is best in your language to use a conjunction between each name in the list (like Hebrew does), or only before the last name in the list. See what you did for a similar list of names in Gen 10:26-29.

GEN	23	2	x2vd		וַ⁠תָּ֣מָת שָׂרָ֗ה	1	Then Sarah died	“Then she died” or “before she died”. Decide whether or not it is best to begin a new sentence here in your language.

You can spell this name as two words, as in the Hebrew text, or combine them into one word, with or without a hyphen. Be consistent with how you spell this name throughout the Bible. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
GEN	23	2	qjmr		הִ֥וא חֶבְר֖וֹן	0	that is, Hebron,	“which is {also called/named} Hebron” or “also known as Hebron”. The city of Kiriath Arba was later named Hebron (Joshua 14:15).

For some languages it is necessary to make it explicit here in verse 3 that Abraham went to the city gates to meet with the Hittites, rather than wait until verse 10. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	23	3	ggr9	translate-names	בְּנֵי חֵ֖ת	1	the sons of Heth	“the descendants of Heth” or “the Hittites”. Heth was Canaan’s son (Genesis 10:15, 15:20). His descendants were the Hittites. Decide the best way to refer to them here in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

The leaders of the city already knew that Abraham was a foreigner, so make sure your translation of this sentence does not sound like he is telling them something new that they did not know. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	23	4	v3un		גֵּר וְ⁠תוֹשָׁ֥ב	1	a foreigner and a sojourner	“a foreigner/outsider who has settled” or “a foreigner/outsider who is living”. See how you translated “foreigner” in Gen 15:13.

GEN	23	16	s49g		וַ⁠יִּשְׁקֹ֤ל אַבְרָהָם֙ לְ⁠עֶפְרֹ֔ן	1	and Abraham weighed out to Ephron	“and/so he paid Ephron/him”

See how you translated this phrase in verse 10. You might need to translate it differently here because of the different context. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	23	16	tv6f		אַרְבַּ֤ע מֵאוֹת֙ שֶׁ֣קֶל כֶּ֔סֶף	1	400 shekels of silver,	“{which was} 400 shekels of silver,” or “{Abraham weighed the} 400 shekels of silver”
GEN	23	16	xapx		עֹבֵ֖ר לַ⁠סֹּחֵֽר	1	the currency among the merchants.	“using/with the same kind of weights/scale that merchants used {to accurately weigh silver/things}.” or “using the standard shekel/weights that sellers/traders used {at that time}.”

GEN	23	17	btbg		הַ⁠שָּׂדֶה֙ וְ⁠הַ⁠מְּעָרָ֣ה אֲשֶׁר בּ֔⁠וֹ	1	the field and the cave that {was} in it,	“{including both} the field and the cave that {was} in it,” or “including the cave that {was} in the field,”

GEN	23	18	gl5r		בְּ⁠כֹ֖ל בָּאֵ֥י שַֽׁעַר עִירֽ⁠וֹ	1	before everyone who had come to the gate of his city.	“including everyone who had gathered at the city gate.” or “That included everyone who had met together at the city gate.” See how you translated a similar phrase in verse 10. The sentence in verses 17 and 18 is very long. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to break it into two or more shorter sentences and say, “That is how {Abraham bought} Ephron’s field, including the cave and all the trees that were within its borders. The field was in the Machpelah {area}, near {the city of} Mamre. Ephron sold the field 18 to Abraham in front of {the leaders of} the Hittites who had gathered at the city gates, so that they all witnessed/knew that the land was now Abraham’s property.”
GEN	23	19	kim7		וְ⁠אַחֲרֵי כֵן֩	1	Then after that,	“After that,” or “After Abraham/he bought the field,”

GEN	23	19	kuwp		עַל פְּנֵ֥י מַמְרֵ֖א	1	before Mamre,	“east of {the city of} Mamre,” or “near {the city of} Mamre,” See how you translated this phrase in verse 17. Also, be consistent here with how you spelled this name in verse 17 and in Gen 14:13, 24; 18:1.
GEN	23	19	f92h		הִ֣וא חֶבְר֑וֹן	1	that {is}, Hebron,	“which is {also called/named} Hebron,” or “also known as Hebron,”
GEN	23	19	r2wk	figs-infostructure	בְּ⁠אֶ֖רֶץ כְּנָֽעַן	1	in the land of Canaan.	“in the land/region called Canaan.” See how you translated this phrase in verse 2. If it is more natural in your language to put a general location before a specific location, you could put this phrase earlier in this sentence before “in the cave”. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	23	20	fiji		וַ⁠יָּ֨קָם הַ⁠שָּׂדֶ֜ה	1	So the field	“So {that is how} that field,” or “So {in that way,} the field {of Ephron}”. Verse 20 is a concluding summary of chapter 23 and repeats parts of verses 17-18. Make sure the way you translate this does not sound like Abraham bought another property from the Hittites.
GEN	23	20	l4mb		וְ⁠הַ⁠מְּעָרָ֧ה אֲשֶׁר בּ֛⁠וֹ	1	and the cave that {was} in it	“including the cave that {was} in the field,”

GEN	24	1	otga	figs-doublet	וְ⁠אַבְרָהָ֣ם זָקֵ֔ן בָּ֖א בַּ⁠יָּמִ֑ים	1	Now Abraham was old, advanced in days,	“Abraham had lived a long time and was {now} {very} old,” or “Abraham was very old now. He had lived many years,” or “Now Abraham had become very old,” Verse one gives the setting for the new episode and begins with a doublet that emphasizes how old Abraham was. Try to preserve this emphasis in a way that is natural in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])
GEN	24	1	qbhp		וַֽ⁠יהוָ֛ה בֵּרַ֥ךְ אֶת אַבְרָהָ֖ם	1	and Yahweh had blessed Abraham	“and Yahweh had blessed him” or “and Yahweh had caused him to prosper”. See how you translated “bless” in Gen 12:2-3.

GEN	24	2	zp2w	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אַבְרָהָ֗ם אֶל	1	Then Abraham said to	“{One day} Abraham/he told”. Consider what is the best way to introduce the first event in this episode in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
GEN	24	2	i8w4		עַבְדּ⁠וֹ֙ זְקַ֣ן בֵּית֔⁠וֹ	1	his oldest servant of his house	“the oldest servant in his household” or “his senior/chief household servant”

You can make the meaning of this custom explicit in your translation, or you can put that information in a footnote. What Abraham asks his servant to do here is part of the vow-making process in verse 3. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
GEN	24	3	yxvm	figs-imperative	וְ⁠אַשְׁבִּ֣יעֲ⁠ךָ֔	1	and I will have you swear	“I want you to vow {to me}” or “and swear/vow {to me}” or “and make an unbreakable promise {to me}”. Decide the best way to translate this command in your language. Also, see how you translated “swear” in Gen 21:23, and see the note about that there. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])
GEN	24	3	wrlc		בַּֽ⁠יהוָה֙ אֱלֹהֵ֣י הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֔יִם וֵֽ⁠אלֹהֵ֖י הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	by Yahweh, the God of the heavens and the God of the earth,	“with Yahweh as your witness, the God who rules/created the heavens and the earth,” See how you translated “the heavens and the earth” in Gen 1:1.
GEN	24	3	dff6	figs-idiom	אֲשֶׁ֨ר לֹֽא תִקַּ֤ח אִשָּׁה֙ לִ⁠בְנִ֔⁠י מִ⁠בְּנוֹת֙	1	that you will not take a wife for my son from	“that you will not get/find/choose a wife/woman for my son {Isaac} {to marry} from {among}” or “that you will not arrange for my son {Isaac} to marry”. For some languages it is clearer and more natural to make “Isaac” explicit here in verse 3, rather than wait until the end of verse 4. Do what is best in your language. Also, see how you translated the idiom “took a wife for” in Gen 21:21. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	24	3	gigp		מִ⁠בְּנוֹת֙ הַֽ⁠כְּנַעֲנִ֔י אֲשֶׁ֥ר אָנֹכִ֖י יוֹשֵׁ֥ב בְּ⁠קִרְבּֽ⁠וֹ	1	the daughters of the Canaanites whom I am living among,	“the Canaanite women whom we live among” or “{any of} the Canaanite women who live around us here”. Make sure your translation does not sound like Abraham was living by himself among the Canaanites; his family and servants also lived among them with him.
GEN	24	4	l49y	figs-imperative	כִּ֧י תֵּלֵ֑ךְ	1	but you will go	“Rather/Instead you must go” or “Rather/Instead I want you to go” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative]])

The phrase “this land” refers to the land of Canaan here, not the land where Abraham’s relatives lived. Make sure that is clear in your translation. Also, consider whether it is more natural here in your language to use a direct quote or an indirect quote. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
GEN	24	7	mkj3		ה֗וּא יִשְׁלַ֤ח מַלְאָכ⁠וֹ֙ לְ⁠פָנֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1	he will send his angel before you,	“He will send one of his angels ahead of you {to guide/help you},” If you begin a new sentence here, make sure that the previous sentence is well-formed and complete in your language. Also, see how you translated “angel” in Gen 22:11, 15.
GEN	24	7	furh		וְ⁠לָקַחְתָּ֥	1	and you will take	“so that you will {be able to} find/choose” or “so that you can find/get”

GEN	24	8	l4is		מִ⁠שְּׁבֻעָתִ֖⁠י זֹ֑את	1	this oath	“this oath/vow” or “this binding/unbreakable promise”. An oath is a serious, unbreakable promise or vow that is made before God to guarantee that it will be fulfilled. See how you translated the verb form of this word (“swear” or “vow”) in verse 3.
GEN	24	8	ukyn		מִ⁠שְּׁבֻעָתִ֖⁠י	1	of mine.	“that I am asking/requesting you to swear/make {today/now}.” or “that you are swearing/making to me {today/now}.”

See how you translated a similar clause in verse 2. Also, in that culture, people owned servants and had complete authority over them. Make sure your translation of “master” and “servant” does not imply that the servant was mistreated. Servants were treated well, could hold important positions and were often considered as members of the master’s family. See how you translated a related term “mistress/owner” in Gen 16:4, 8-9. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
GEN	24	9	f12s		וַ⁠יִּשָּׁ֣בַֽע ל֔⁠וֹ	1	and swore to him	“and vowed to him” or “and made an oath/vow to him” or “and made an unbreakable promise to him”. See how you translated “swore” in verse 7 and “swear” in verse 3.

Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	24	10	g0ln	grammar-connect-time-sequential	וַ⁠יִּקַּ֣ח הָ֠⁠עֶבֶד	1	Then the servant	“Then/Next he” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential]])

Make sure that your translation of “took” does not imply that the servant stole the camels or valuable things from Abraham. Rather, the “good things” that he loaded on the camels included things that he would give as gifts to Isaac’s relatives (verse 53). Also, see how you translated “camels” in Gen 12:16.
GEN	24	10	k39j	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֵּ֔לֶךְ וְ⁠כָל ט֥וּב אֲדֹנָ֖י⁠ו בְּ⁠יָד֑⁠וֹ וַ⁠יָּ֗קָם וַ⁠יֵּ֛לֶךְ	1	and left, and all {kinds of} good {things} from his master {were} in his hand, and he got up and	“and left {with some other servants}, taking with him many of his master’s valuable things {to give as gifts}. Then he” or “and after he loaded them with all kinds of valuable things from his master {to use as gifts}, he left {with some other servants} and”. For some languages, it is best to make it explicit here in verse 10 that other servants went with Abraham’s chief servant, rather than have them appear suddenly in verse 32. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	24	10	lvli		וַ⁠יֵּ֛לֶךְ אֶל	1	went to	“made the {long} journey/trip to” or “traveled to”. This was about a 500 mile (800 kilometer) trip and would take camels about seventeen days to complete.
GEN	24	10	o483		אֲרַ֥ם נַֽהֲרַ֖יִם	1	Aram Naharaim,	“{the region of} Aram Naharaim,”
GEN	24	10	m9hb		אֶל עִ֥יר נָחֽוֹר	1	to the city of Nahor.	“to Nahor’s city.” or “to the city where Nahor lived.” Nahor lived in the city of Haran (Gen 11:31-32). That information could be put in a footnote. Make sure your translation of this phrase does not sound like Nahor owned the city.
GEN	24	11	ya2d		וַ⁠יַּבְרֵ֧ךְ הַ⁠גְּמַלִּ֛ים מִ⁠ח֥וּץ לָ⁠עִ֖יר	1	Then he made the camels kneel down outside the city	“{When they arrived there,} Abraham’s servant had the camels kneel/lie down {to rest} outside the city”
GEN	24	11	n9un		אֶל בְּאֵ֣ר הַ⁠מָּ֑יִם	1	by the well of water	“near its well” or “by/near the {community/public} well {that was there}”. Each town or city had a well where people from the city came to get their water. See how you translated “well of water” in Gen 21:19. You might translate this slightly differently here because of the different context.
GEN	24	11	po5b		לְ⁠עֵ֣ת עֶ֔רֶב	1	at evening time,	“It was evening time,” Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	24	12	b7bz	writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּאמַ֓ר	1	Then he said,	Then Abraham’s servant said/prayed,” Consider what is the best way to begin this paragraph in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])

It may be clearer and more natural to change the order of the clauses in this sentence and say, “Please be kind/gracious to my master by helping me succeed today.” or “Please show your kindness to my master today by helping me {find a wife/woman for his son to marry}.” Do what is best in your language.

GEN	24	13	d051	writing-politeness	הִנֵּ֛ה אָנֹכִ֥י נִצָּ֖ב עַל	1	Behold, I am standing by	“Look/See, {here} I am, standing beside/near” or “As you see/know, I am standing {here} beside/near”. Make sure in your translation that what Abraham’s servant says here to Yahweh sounds polite and respectful, not rude, demanding or complaining. Also, he is not telling God something that God did not already know. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness]])
GEN	24	13	qm03		עֵ֣ין הַ⁠מָּ֑יִם	0	this spring of water,	“this spring/well,” or “this spring-fed well,” The phrase “spring of water” (here and in verse 16) refers to the same well that is referred to in verses 11 and 20, which means that this was probably a spring-fed well. Some translation teams use only one term to refer to this spring or well throughout this chapter in order to prevent confusion. Decide what is best in your language.

GEN	24	14	slit		הַֽ⁠נַּעֲרָ֗ אֲשֶׁ֨ר אֹמַ֤ר אֵלֶ֨י⁠הָ֙	1	the young woman whom I say to her,	“when I say to one of the young women,” The phrase “young woman” is actually a single word in Hebrew (like the old English words “damsel” and “maiden”) and refers to a young woman who is old enough to get married, but has never been married before. Some languages have a single word for this; other languages prefer a phrase.

For some languages it is clearer and more natural to make one or both of the two embedded direct quotes in this verse into indirect quotes. For example you could say, “{Please} make it happen that when I ask one of the young women to lower her jug so that I can have a drink {of water}, she will offer me a drink and will also offer to draw water for my camels.” Do what is best in your language.

Do what is natural in your language.
GEN	24	15	sm3c		וְ⁠הִנֵּ֧ה	1	then behold,	“just then {he saw}” or “suddenly {he saw}”. This phrase spotlights Rebekah and shows that she is the center of attention. Consider the best way to communicate that in your language.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Also see how you translated “my lord” in Gen 23:6, 11, 15. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-honorifics]])

Starting in verse 21 the Hebrew text takes Rebekah and Laban’s perspective and refers to Abraham’s servant as “the man”. This continues until verse 34, when the servant tells everyone that he is Abraham’s servant. For some languages this is confusing (because it sounds like two different people), so for those languages it is necessary to refer to him as “Abraham’s servant” or “the servant” throughout this chapter. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])

Many translation teams keep the numbers and the names of weights that are used in the Bible text in their translation, and they may or may not put the modern equivalents in pounds or grams in a footnote. Other teams do the opposite. One beka was about 1/5 of an ounce (5.5 grams), and ten shekels (see below) was about 4 ounces (110 grams). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bweight]])

GEN	24	22	u0aq		עַל יָדֶ֔י⁠הָ	1	for her arms,	“for her wrists”. The Hebrew term is ambiguous here; it can refer to hands, arms or wrists. However in this context, the bracelets would have been put on the arms or the wrists.

The phrase “Please tell me” can go: (1) with the previous question; or (2) with the following question. Since Abraham’s servant’s goal is to find a wife for Isaac who is one of Abraham’s relatives, the first interpretation seems most likely.
GEN	24	23	d4qm	writing-pronouns	הֲ⁠יֵ֧שׁ בֵּית אָבִ֛י⁠ךְ מָק֥וֹם	1	Is there a place at the house of your father	“{Also,} is there {enough} room/space at/in his house” or “{Also,} does your father have enough/any room in/at his house”. If you made “your father” explicit in the previous sentence, it may be more natural to refer to him with the pronoun “his” in this sentence. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	24	23	dyu7	figs-exclusive	לָ֖⁠נוּ	1	for us	“for me and my men”. The pronoun “us” includes other servants who came with Abraham’s chief servant (as verse 32 shows). If your language has inclusive and exclusive forms of this pronoun, you should use the exclusive form here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

Also, in some cultures the father’s name is normally given first; in other cultures the mother’s name is normally first.
GEN	24	25	lasf	writing-quotations	וַ⁠תֹּ֣אמֶר אֵלָ֔י⁠ו	1	Then she said to him,	“Then she added/continued,” Some languages leave this quote margin implied here, because the same person is still talking to the same person. Other languages can keep the quote margin (like the Hebrew text does), to emphasize what Rebekah says next. The quote margin may also indicate that Rebekah paused before she said what she says in verse 25. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])

See how you translated “bowed” in Gen 18:2; 19:1. The word “prostrated” means he bowed low to the ground and touched his face or forehead to the ground with outstretched arms, in an act of worship. When combined with “bowed down” as in this verse, it is usually translated as “worshiped”. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
GEN	24	27	wog6		וַ⁠יֹּ֗אמֶר	1	and said,	“saying,” or “He said,” The servant is worshiping God by bowing down and by what he says in verse 27.

See how you translated “kindness” in verses 12 and 14. The phrase “not abandoned” is a way of emphasizing that Yahweh had always been kind and faithful to Abraham. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes]])
GEN	24	27	pjck		אָנֹכִ֗י בַּ⁠דֶּ֨רֶךְ֙ נָחַ֣⁠נִי יְהוָ֔ה	1	{As for} me, Yahweh has led me on the road	“and he has guided me on the road/journey {here}” or “{Yes,} Yahweh/he guided me on the/my journey/trip {here}”. The last part of verse 27 is what Abraham’s servant is praising God for; it is an example of how God has been kind and faithful to Abraham.
GEN	24	27	wmpk		בֵּ֖ית אֲחֵ֥י אֲדֹנִֽ⁠י	1	{to} the home of the relatives of my master!”	“{to} the home of my master’s relatives/family!” or “{to} the home where my master’s relatives/family live!”

Verse 30 is a flashback of what had happened before Laban ran to the well (verse 29). Consider the best way to express this in your language. For some languages it may be necessary to combine verses 29-30 and put the sentences in the order that things actually happened. For example, “Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban. When he saw the nose ring and the bracelets that she was wearing, and heard her tell what the man had said to her, he hurried out to meet the man. He found/saw him standing with his camels beside the well.” If you do this, you would mark these combined verses as 29-30. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge]])

Some languages have a specific term for “younger sister” that fits well here. Also see how you translated “nose ring” and “bracelets” in verse 22.

If you want to make it clear who “the man” refers to, you should still translate it generally, for example, “the man {I met at the well}” because when Rebekah said this, she did not yet know who he was. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

GEN	24	30	vza3		וְ⁠הִנֵּ֛ה עֹמֵ֥ד	1	and behold, he was standing	“and there he was, standing” or “He found/saw him standing”. The word “behold” emphasizes what follows it. Consider the best way to do this in your language.
GEN	24	30	xad0		עַל הַ⁠גְּמַלִּ֖ים עַל הָ⁠עָֽיִן	1	by the camels at the spring.	“with {his} camels at/beside the spring/well.” or “beside/near the spring/well with {his} camels.”

GEN	24	32	c88c		וַ⁠יְפַתַּ֖ח הַ⁠גְּמַלִּ֑ים	1	Then he unloaded the camels	“{When they arrived there,} Laban unloaded the camels” or “There Laban took the loads off the camels”. The Hebrew text (“he”) is ambiguous here, but since Laban was the host it is most likely that he (or some of his servants) took care of the camels for his guests.

See how you translated “wash {the dust off} your feet” in Gen 19:2. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

As in verse 3, make sure your translation does not sound like Abraham lived by himself among the Canaanites; his family and servants also lived among them with him.
GEN	24	38	svl3		אִם לֹ֧א	1	but rather	“Rather/Instead”. Consider whether or not it is more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here. After you translate a section, it is a good habit to read through it at normal speed as you pay attention to where it is best to begin new sentences so that sentences and paragraphs flow well and it is easy for people to read.

For example, you could make “you” explicit in this clause. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Then I said to her,” or “After she walked down to the well and filled her jar/jug with water, I said to her,” Consider again how you translated “spring” (verses 13, 16, 29-30, 42-43 and 45) and “well” (verses 11 and 20) in this chapter. Both terms refer to the same source of water. See the note about this at verse 13.

There are two different places where you could begin a new sentence here. Consider what is the most clear and natural way to do this in your language.

Make sure your translation of this verse does not sound like Abraham had two wives named Keturah. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	25	2	ufe1		וַ⁠תֵּ֣לֶד ל֗⁠וֹ	1	And she bore for him	“She/Keturah gave birth to sons for him/Abraham {whose names were}” or “She bore/had {sons} for/with him {whom they named}” or “They had sons together {whom they named}”. See how you translated “bore for him” in Gen 21:3; 24:47.

Make sure you spelled “Keturah” consistently in verses 1-4.

In that time and culture, a father would give his children their inheritance before he died.

The word “gifts” in this clause is very general and can include domestic animals, servants, gold, silver, and other things. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])

The Hebrew word “Kedem” means “east” and refers to the region east of Canaan and the Dead Sea. Consider whether it is best in your language to transliterate (copy) the Hebrew name or to translate the meaning. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

Also consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	25	8	lf0z		וַ⁠יֵּאָ֖סֶף אֶל	1	he was gathered to	“he was gathered/taken {by God} to be with” or “{God} took his spirit to be with” or “he joined”. The phrase “gathered to his people” is a euphemism that refers to dying but also implies that God took his spirit to be with his ancestors who had already died. It is best to translate this phrase fairly literally since it teaches about life after death.
GEN	25	8	tzbt	figs-explicit	עַמָּֽי⁠ו	1	his people.	“his ancestors/relatives {who had already died}.” or “his ancestors/relatives {who had gone/died before him}.” or “his {deceased} ancestors/relatives.” Make sure your translation of this phrase does not sound like these ancestors were still alive. They had already died before Abraham died. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

See how you translated “the sons of Heth” in Gen 23:20.

Make sure your translation of this sentence does not sound like Sarah was buried there a second time. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Both refer to temporary or permanent places where people settled, surrounded by some sort of wall or fence. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	25	16	ukpt		נְשִׂיאִ֖ם	1	rulers	“{original} leaders/chiefs”. Many translations have “princes” here, but these Ishmaelite rulers were not actually sons of a king. See how you translated “rulers” in Gen 17:20.

Be consistent here with how you spelled “Havilah” in Gen 2:11; 10:7, 29 and “Shur” in Gen 16:7; 20:1. The name “Shur” means “wall”. The Wilderness of Shur may have been named after a city or fortification named Shur that was located near the eastern border of Egypt (Gen 16:7). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

It could mean (1) “He/They lived in hostility toward/against all his/their brothers/relatives.” or “They lived as enemies against all their brothers/relatives.” See how you translated a different idiom in 16:12 that probably has this meaning. (2) “They settled/lived in the presence of all their brothers/relatives.” or “They settled/lived among/near all their brothers/relatives.” (3) “He/Ishmael died in the presence of all his brothers/relatives.” or “He/Ishmael died when all his brothers were still alive.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

GEN	25	23	ueoz		יִפָּרֵ֑דוּ	1	will be divided	“will be divided/hostile {against each other}” or “will be rivals/enemies”
GEN	25	23	wzwg		מִ⁠מֵּעַ֖יִ⁠ךְ	1	from inside your womb.	“{starting now} even while they are {still} inside you.” or “{starting now} even before they are born.”
GEN	25	23	eudo		וּ⁠לְאֹם֙ מִ⁠לְאֹ֣ם יֶֽאֱמָ֔ץ	1	And one people will be stronger than the other people,	“One of them will be more powerful than the other,”
GEN	25	23	acfy		וְ⁠רַ֖ב יַעֲבֹ֥ד צָעִֽיר	1	and the older will serve the younger.”	“so that the older {son’s descendants} will serve the younger {son’s descendants}.”
GEN	25	24	yun3		וַ⁠יִּמְלְא֥וּ יָמֶ֖י⁠הָ לָ⁠לֶ֑דֶת	1	Then her days were fulfilled to deliver,	“Later when it was time for her/Rebekah to give birth,”

GEN	25	25	jz9j	figs-simile	וַ⁠יֵּצֵ֤א הָ⁠רִאשׁוֹן֙ אַדְמוֹנִ֔י כֻּלּ֖⁠וֹ כְּ⁠אַדֶּ֣רֶת שֵׂעָ֑ר	1	And the first came out red, all of him {was} like a garment of hair,	“When the first one/baby came out, he was covered with thick red hair so that he was as hairy as a fur coat/robe.” or “The first {one/baby} who was born was completely covered with thick red hair.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
GEN	25	25	b4y3		וַ⁠יִּקְרְא֥וּ שְׁמ֖⁠וֹ	1	so they called his name	“So his parents named him” or “So he was called/named”. The Hebrew text has “they” here, which probably refers to Esau’s parents and may include people in general after his parents named him.
GEN	25	25	caz7	translate-names	עֵשָֽׂו	1	Esau.	“Esau {which means “hairy”}.” Consider whether or not to include the meaning of Esau’s name in the text or in a footnote. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
GEN	25	26	tdza	grammar-connect-logic-sequential	וְ⁠אַֽחֲרֵי כֵ֞ן	1	Then after that,	“Next” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-sequential]])
GEN	25	26	n4uq		יָצָ֣א אָחִ֗י⁠ו	1	his brother came out	“his brother was born”. Some languages have a specific term for a younger brother that fits here. See what you did in Gen 4:2.
GEN	25	26	l2fm		וְ⁠יָד֤⁠וֹ אֹחֶ֨זֶת֙ בַּ⁠עֲקֵ֣ב עֵשָׂ֔ו	1	and his hand was grabbing on to the heel of Esau,	“with his hand holding on {tightly} to Esau’s heel.” or “gripping Esau’s heel {tightly} with his hand.”
GEN	25	26	hhp9		וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֥א שְׁמ֖⁠וֹ	1	so he called his name	“So they called/named him” or “So he was called/named”. See how you translated a similar clause in verse 25 that probably has the same meaning.
GEN	25	26	l3q4	translate-names	יַעֲקֹ֑ב	1	Jacob.	“Jacob {which means “heel-grabber”}.” If you decide to include the meaning of Jacob’s name in the text or in a footnote, make sure it matches the way you translate “grabbing” earlier in this sentence. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
GEN	25	26	hwct	figs-idiom	וְ⁠יִצְחָ֛ק בֶּן שִׁשִּׁ֥ים שָׁנָ֖ה	1	And Isaac {was} a son of 60 years	“Isaac {was} 60 years old”. See how you translated the idiom “was a son of...years” in verse 20. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	25	26	s22s		בְּ⁠לֶ֥דֶת אֹתָֽ⁠ם	1	when she bore them.	“when Rebekah gave birth to them.” or “when Esau and Jacob were born.”
GEN	25	27	aq7w		וַֽ⁠יִּגְדְּלוּ֙ הַ⁠נְּעָרִ֔ים וַ⁠יְהִ֣י	1	Then the boys grew up, and	“When/As the boys grew up/older,”
GEN	25	27	lbs3		וַ⁠יְהִ֣י עֵשָׂ֗ו אִ֛ישׁ יֹדֵ֥עַ צַ֖יִד	1	Esau became a man who knew hunting,	“Esau became a skilled/expert hunter,” or “Esau became good at hunting animals {for food},” See how you translated a similar phrase (“mighty hunter”) in Gen 10:9.
GEN	25	27	prc8		אִ֣ישׁ שָׂדֶ֑ה	1	a man of the field,	“and he enjoyed/preferred {being/working in} the open country,” or “and he was an outdoorsman,”
GEN	25	27	oo1e	grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וְ⁠יַעֲקֹב֙ אִ֣ישׁ תָּ֔ם	1	and Jacob {was} a quiet man	“but/whereas Jacob {was} a quiet/mild-mannered man/person” or “Jacob, on the other hand, had a quiet/mild-mannered personality/character”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here. Also, make sure that it is clear in your translation that Esau and Jacob are being contrasted. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast]])
GEN	25	27	cfy6		יֹשֵׁ֖ב אֹהָלִֽים	1	who stayed among the tents.	“and stayed/worked close to home.” or “and {liked/preferred} to be/work at/near home.”
GEN	25	28	ypck		וַ⁠יֶּאֱהַ֥ב יִצְחָ֛ק אֶת עֵשָׂ֖ו	1	And Isaac loved Esau,	“Isaac loved Esau {most},” or “Isaac’s favorite son was Esau,” Your translation should not sound like Isaac and Rebekah did not love both of their sons. Rather, they each had their favorite son.
GEN	25	28	sf4z	figs-infostructure	כִּי צַ֣יִד בְּ⁠פִ֑י⁠ו	1	because {he liked} game meat in his mouth,	“because he liked to eat the meat of wild animals/deer {that he/Esau hunted},” Make sure your translation of “he liked” refers here to Isaac, not Esau. For some languages it is clearer or more natural to put this clause first in this sentence and say, “Isaac liked to eat wild animal/deer meat, so his favorite son was Esau”. Do what is best your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	25	28	h65f		וְ⁠רִבְקָ֖ה אֹהֶ֥בֶת אֶֽת יַעֲקֹֽב	1	but Rebekah loved Jacob.	“but/whereas Rebekah loved Jacob {most}.” or “but/whereas Rebekah’s favorite son was Jacob.” See how you translated a similar clause earlier in this verse.
GEN	25	29	fc1u	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יָּ֥זֶד יַעֲקֹ֖ב נָזִ֑יד וַ⁠יָּבֹ֥א	1	Now Jacob was cooking stew, and	“{Once} Jacob was making/cooking {some} stew/soup, and” or “{One day} when Jacob was making {some} stew/soup,” According to verse 34, this stew (or thick soup) was made out of lentils, which are a type of bean; it may also have had pieces of meat in it. Consider what is the best way in your language to introduce the first event in this episode (following the background information in verses 27-28). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
GEN	25	29	j6yx		וַ⁠יָּבֹ֥א עֵשָׂ֛ו מִן הַ⁠שָּׂדֶ֖ה	1	Esau came in from the field	“Esau came home from {hunting/working out in} the fields/country”. See how you translated “field” in verse 27.
GEN	25	29	sa5e		וְ⁠ה֥וּא עָיֵֽף	1	and he {was} exhausted.	“and he {was/felt} exhausted/weak {from hunger}.” or “and he {was/felt} exhausted/weak {and hungry}.” or “extremely/very tired {and hungry}.” The Hebrew word for “exhausted” means Esau was very tired (perhaps even feeling faint) from his hunting or work, as well as hungry and thirsty from lack of food. Some languages have an idiom for this that fits well here. Do what is best in your language.
GEN	25	30	kysf	writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר עֵשָׂ֜ו אֶֽל יַעֲקֹ֗ב	1	Then Esau said to Jacob,	“So Esau asked Jacob,” or “So Esau requested from Jacob,” Consider what is the best way in your language to translate this quote margin. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	25	30	c7ii		הַלְעִיטֵ֤⁠נִי נָא֙	1	“Please let me devour	“Please let me eat/have”
GEN	25	30	bg98		מִן הָ⁠אָדֹ֤ם הָ⁠אָדֹם֙ הַ⁠זֶּ֔ה	1	some of that very red stuff	“some of that very/dark red stew/soup {you are making}”
GEN	25	30	bvio		כִּ֥י עָיֵ֖ף אָנֹ֑כִי	1	because I {am} exhausted!	“because I {am/feel} exhausted/weak {from hunger}!” or “because I {am/feel} {hungry and} exhausted/weak!” See how you translated “exhausted” in verse 29.
GEN	25	30	t3zl		עַל כֵּ֥ן	1	For that {reason}	“That is why” or “Because he/Esau said that,”
GEN	25	30	cb0x		קָרָֽא שְׁמ֖⁠וֹ	1	they called his name	“he/Esau was/is {also} called/nicknamed” or “his/Esau’s nickname was” or “they/people called/nicknamed him”
GEN	25	30	vjf8	translate-names	אֱדֽוֹם	1	Edom.	“Edom, {which means “red.”}” You could include the meaning of “Edom” in your translation or in a footnote so that it is clear why Esau was given that name. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
GEN	25	31	ls96	writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֖אמֶר יַעֲקֹ֑ב	1	But Jacob said,	“But Jacob said/replied {to him},” or “Jacob replied,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	25	31	lf99		כַ⁠יּ֛וֹם	1	On this day	“Today {right now} or “Right now” or “First”
GEN	25	31	a8hm	figs-explicit	מִכְרָ֥⁠ה אֶת בְּכֹֽרָתְ⁠ךָ֖ לִֽ⁠י	1	sell your birthright to me.”	“give your birthright to me in exchange {for some stew/soup}.” or “trade your rights as the firstborn/oldest son to me {for the/some stew/soup,} {then I will give you some}.” Make sure it is clear in your translation that Jacob was offering the stew as payment for Esau’s birthright as the firstborn son. In Hebrew culture the firstborn son inherited twice as much as the rest of the children in the family (Deuteronomy 21:15-17). That information could be put in a footnote so that people understand what Esau was selling for a bowl of stew. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	25	32	ups7	writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר עֵשָׂ֔ו	1	And Esau said,	“Esau said/responded {to him},” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	25	32	edaj	figs-hyperbole	הִנֵּ֛ה אָנֹכִ֥י הוֹלֵ֖ךְ לָ⁠מ֑וּת	1	“Behold, I am about to die!	“Look, I am about to die {from hunger}!” or “Look/Listen, {I am so hungry that I feel like} I am about/going to die!” Esau is using hyperbole or exaggeration here to emphasize how hungry he is. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
GEN	25	32	mfk9	figs-rquestion	וְ⁠לָ⁠מָּה זֶּ֥ה לִ֖⁠י בְּכֹרָֽה	1	So for what use {is} that to me, a birthright?	“So how will my birthright benefit me {if I die}?” or “So my birthright is of no use/value/benefit to me {right now}!” Esau uses a rhetorical question to emphasize his point about how hungry he is. Consider whether or not a rhetorical question works well here in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
GEN	25	33	hhw9	writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר יַעֲקֹ֗ב	1	But Jacob said,	“Jacob insisted,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	25	33	kaeg	figs-explicit	הִשָּׁ֤בְעָ⁠ה לִּ⁠י֙ כַּ⁠יּ֔וֹם	1	“Swear to me on this day!”	“{First} make an oath/vow to me today {before God} {that your rights are now mine}!” or “{You must first} vow/promise to me right now {that you sell/give your rights to me}.” See how you translated “swear to me by God” in Gen 21:23. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	25	33	rvjd		וַ⁠יִּשָּׁבַ֖ע ל֑⁠וֹ	1	So he swore to him	“So he/Esau swore/vowed to him/Jacob” or “So Esau made an unbreakable promise/vow to him/Jacob”. Make sure the way you translate this clause fits well with what Jacob just said.
GEN	25	33	vfb6		וַ⁠יִּמְכֹּ֥ר אֶת בְּכֹרָת֖⁠וֹ לְ⁠יַעֲקֹֽב	1	and sold his birthright to Jacob.	“that he had sold/traded his rights as the firstborn/oldest son to Jacob/him {for the stew/soup}.” or “that he was selling/giving his firstborn-son-rights to Jacob/him {in exchange for the stew/soup}.” See how you translated “sell your birthright” in verse 31. Also see how Hebrews 12:16 is translated, which refers to the same event.
GEN	25	34	coi0	translate-unknown	וְ⁠יַעֲקֹ֞ב נָתַ֣ן לְ⁠עֵשָׂ֗ו לֶ֚חֶם וּ⁠נְזִ֣יד עֲדָשִׁ֔ים	1	Then Jacob gave to Esau bread and lentil stew	“Then Jacob gave Esau {some} bread and {some of the} lentil stew/soup” or “Then Jacob gave Esau {some of the} lentil stew/soup and/with {some} bread”. Consider again how you translated “stew/soup” in verses 29 and 34. Lentils are small, round, flat, reddish-brown legume seeds that grow inside a pod (similar to peas or beans). If lentils are not known in your area, you could describe them as “a type of legume/bean called lentils”. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
GEN	25	34	ddbx		וַ⁠יֹּ֣אכַל וַ⁠יֵּ֔שְׁתְּ וַ⁠יָּ֖קָם וַ⁠יֵּלַ֑ךְ	1	and he ate and drank, and got up and left.	“and Esau ate, drank, got/stood up and left.” or “and Esau {quickly/hurriedly} ate the meal and left.” Consider what is the most natural way to translate this series of actions that happened quickly one after the other and shows how flippantly Esau treated his birthright.
GEN	25	34	ibjm		וַ⁠יִּ֥בֶז עֵשָׂ֖ו אֶת הַ⁠בְּכֹרָֽה	1	So Esau despised his birthright.	“So Esau showed that he did not value his rights as the firstborn/oldest son.” or “In that way, Esau treated his birthright {carelessly/flippantly} as if it had no value.” See how you translated “birthright” in verses 31-33.
GEN	26	1	eytb	writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֤י	1	Then there was	“Then/Now there was”. Consider what is the best way in your language to begin this new episode. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])
GEN	26	1	ptz6		רָעָב֙	1	a famine	“{another} famine” or “{another} extreme/serious shortage/lack of food” or “{another} {time of} extreme/severe food shortage”. See how you translated “famine” in Gen 12:10. in the land, “in the/that country/region”
GEN	26	1	yrk5		מִ⁠לְּ⁠בַד֙ הָ⁠רָעָ֣ב הָ⁠רִאשׁ֔וֹן אֲשֶׁ֥ר הָיָ֖ה	1	besides the earlier famine that was	“in addition to the previous famine/one/shortage that occurred/happened” or “{This was} a different famine/shortage from the one that had happened {years} earlier/before,”
GEN	26	1	cs3z		בִּ⁠ימֵ֣י אַבְרָהָ֑ם	1	in the days of Abraham.	“during Abraham’s lifetime.” or “while Abraham was still alive.”
GEN	26	1	mkbt	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֵּ֧לֶךְ יִצְחָ֛ק	1	So Isaac	“So Isaac {and his family}”. In your translation it should not sound like Isaac went alone to the city of Gerar; the rest of his family lived with him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	26	1	bioa		וַ⁠יֵּ֧לֶךְ אֶל אֲבִימֶּ֥לֶךְ מֶֽלֶךְ פְּלִשְׁתִּ֖ים	0	went to Abimelech, the king of the Philistines,	“went {for help} to {King} Abimelech, {who was} the king over the Philistines.” or “went to {King} Abimelech, who ruled the Philistines, {to ask him for help}.” See how you translated “Philistines” in Gen 10:14; 21:32, 34.
GEN	26	1	bdnd	figs-infostructure	גְּרָֽרָ⁠ה	1	to Gerar.	“{He/Abimelech lived} in {the city of} Gerar.” or “{He/Abimelech ruled} from {the city of} Gerar{, which was the Philistines’ capital city}.” King Abimelech ruled all the Philistines from Gerar, their capital city. Make sure your translation does not sound like the only Philistines he ruled were the ones who lived in Gerar. For some languages it may be clearer to put the location (Gerar) earlier in this sentence and say, “So Isaac went to {the city of} Gerar to {ask for help from} King Abimelech who ruled over the Philistines.” Do what is best in your language. Also be consistent here with how you translated “{the city of} Gerar” in Gen 10:19; 20:1-2. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	26	2	cm6l	writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֵּרָ֤א אֵלָי⁠ו֙ יְהוָ֔ה	1	Then Yahweh appeared to him	“Then Yahweh came to Isaac”. See how you translated “appeared” in Gen 12:7. Also consider whether it is more natural in your language to refer to Isaac here with his name or a pronoun. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	26	2	veow	writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֖אמֶר	1	and said,	“and said {to him},” or “and told/commanded {him},” Consider what is the best way in your language to translate this quote margin. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	26	2	f717	figs-explicit	אַל תֵּרֵ֣ד	1	“Do not go down	“Do not go/travel south” or “Do not go/travel”. Egypt was lower in elevation and also south of the land of the Philistines. Many translations leave that information implied. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	26	2	kxwg		מִצְרָ֑יְמָ⁠ה	1	to Egypt;	“to {the land/country of} Egypt”
GEN	26	2	tetb		שְׁכֹ֣ן בָּ⁠אָ֔רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֖ר אֹמַ֥ר אֵלֶֽי⁠ךָ	1	live in the land that I tell you.	“{rather} live/stay/reside in the/this land where/wherever I tell you {to live}.” or “{rather} live where/wherever I tell you to live.”
GEN	26	3	l1fs		גּ֚וּר	1	Sojourn	“You must live/stay/reside for a while” or “Live/Stay/Reside temporarily {as a foreigner/outsider}”. See how you translated this term in Gen 12:10 and 19:9. You may need to translate it slightly differently, depending on the context.
GEN	26	3	atju		בָּ⁠אָ֣רֶץ הַ⁠זֹּ֔את	1	in this land,	“in this region,”
GEN	26	3	htsc		וְ⁠אֶֽהְיֶ֥ה עִמְּ⁠ךָ֖	1	and I will be with you	“and I will stay with you” or “and I will be/stay {right} beside you”. This means that God will guide, help, and protect Isaac, and provide for his needs.
GEN	26	3	p37f	translate-keyterms	וַ⁠אֲבָרְכֶ֑⁠ךָּ	1	and bless you.	“and prosper you.” or “cause you {and your family} to prosper.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-keyterms]])
GEN	26	3	tzl5	grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּֽי לְ⁠ךָ֣ וּֽ⁠לְ⁠זַרְעֲ⁠ךָ֗ אֶתֵּן֙ אֶת כָּל הָֽ⁠אֲרָצֹ֣ת הָ⁠אֵ֔ל	1	For to you and to your offspring I will give all these lands,	“In fact, I will give all the {surrounding} lands/regions to you and your offspring/descendants,” Starting here (through verse 4) Yahweh explains how he will bless Isaac. Begin this sentence in a way that makes that clear in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases]])
GEN	26	3	pbgx		וַ⁠הֲקִֽמֹתִי֙	1	and I will confirm	“and I will continue to keep/fulfill”
GEN	26	3	w67k		אֶת הַ⁠שְּׁבֻעָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר נִשְׁבַּ֖עְתִּי לְ⁠אַבְרָהָ֥ם אָבִֽי⁠ךָ	1	the oath that I swore to Abraham your father.	“the vow/promise that I made to your father Abraham.” Consider again how you translated “oath” in Gen 24:8 and 26:3.
GEN	26	4	gxa8		וְ⁠הִרְבֵּיתִ֤י	1	And I will	“Yes, I will” or “I will”. Verse 4 gives the details of the oath that is referred to in verse 3.
GEN	26	4	zyen	figs-simile	וְ⁠הִרְבֵּיתִ֤י אֶֽת זַרְעֲ⁠ךָ֙ כְּ⁠כוֹכְבֵ֣י	1	multiply your offspring as	“multiply/increase {the number of} your offspring/descendants {so that they are as numerous/countless} as” or “make your offspring/descendants as numerous/many/countless as” or “give you so many offspring that they will be as numerous as”. See how you translated a similar clause in Gen 22:17. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
GEN	26	4	rs9j		כְּ⁠כוֹכְבֵ֣י הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֔יִם	1	the stars of the heavens,	“the {number of} stars in the sky,”
GEN	26	4	rkow		וְ⁠נָתַתִּ֣י	1	and I will give	“I will also give”. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
GEN	26	4	fciv		לְ⁠זַרְעֲ⁠ךָ֔	1	to your offspring	“to your descendants” or “to them”
GEN	26	4	ickr		אֵ֥ת כָּל הָ⁠אֲרָצֹ֖ת הָ⁠אֵ֑ל	1	all these lands.	“all these regions.” See how you translated this phrase in verse 3.
GEN	26	4	ft8m		וְ⁠הִרְבֵּיתִ֤י	2	And	“In fact,”
GEN	26	4	nq9c		בְ⁠זַרְעֲ⁠ךָ֔	1	in your offspring	“through your offspring/descendants” or “because of your offspring/descendants” or “by means of your offspring/descendants”. See how you translated this phrase and the following clause in Gen 22:18.
GEN	26	4	uky1	figs-activepassive	וְ⁠הִתְבָּרֲכ֣וּ כֹּ֖ל גּוֹיֵ֥י הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	all the nations of the earth will be blessed,	“all the people/ethnic groups on earth will be blessed {by me},” or “{I} will bless all the people/ethnic groups on the earth,” Consider what is the best way in your language to translate this passive clause. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])
GEN	26	5	uvg6		עֵ֕קֶב אֲשֶׁר	1	because	“{all} because” or “{I will do all that} because”. Verse 5 gives the reason that Yahweh will do everything that he says in verses 3 and 4. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
GEN	26	5	kf0l	figs-metonymy	שָׁמַ֥ע אַבְרָהָ֖ם בְּ⁠קֹלִ֑⁠י	1	Abraham obeyed my voice	“Abraham obeyed me” or “Abraham {always} obeyed/did what I told him”. The phrase “my voice” stands for what Yahweh said to Abraham and also represents Yahweh himself. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
GEN	26	5	nl8r	figs-parallelism	וַ⁠יִּשְׁמֹר֙ מִשְׁמַרְתִּ֔⁠י מִצְוֺתַ֖⁠י חֻקּוֹתַ֥⁠י וְ⁠תוֹרֹתָֽ⁠י	1	and kept my requirements, my commands, my decrees, and my laws.”	“Yes, he kept/obeyed all my requirements, {including} {all} my commands, decrees, and laws.” or “and did everything that I ever commanded {him} {to do}.” This clause is another way of saying “obeyed my voice” in the previous clause, and emphasizes that Abraham always obeyed God in everything. Notice that the terms in this clause have much overlap in meaning. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])
GEN	26	6	tghi		וַ⁠יֵּ֥שֶׁב יִצְחָ֖ק	1	So Isaac	“So/Then Isaac {did/obeyed what God said/commanded and}”
GEN	26	6	bm6n	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֵּ֥שֶׁב בִּ⁠גְרָֽר	1	stayed in Gerar.	“stayed/settled {with his family} in {the city of} Gerar.” In your translation it should not sound like Isaac lived alone; the rest of his family lived with him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	26	7	gjml		וַֽ⁠יִּשְׁאֲל֞וּ אַנְשֵׁ֤י	1	Then the men	“After a while the men” or “When the men”
GEN	26	7	l8a4		אַנְשֵׁ֤י הַ⁠מָּקוֹם֙	1	of the place	“of/from that place/city” or “from there”
GEN	26	7	apl2		וַֽ⁠יִּשְׁאֲל֞וּ לְ⁠אִשְׁתּ֔⁠וֹ וַ⁠יֹּ֖אמֶר	1	asked about his wife, and	“started asking {Isaac/him} about Rebekah,”

Slaves and servants were owned by their masters but often they were treated as respected members of the family. An example of this was Abraham’s head servant who was sent to find a wife for Isaac (Gen 24). Keep this information in mind as you translate “servants” into your language.

GEN	26	20	v2cu		כִּ֥י הִֽתְעַשְּׂק֖וּ עִמּֽ⁠וֹ	1	because they disputed with him.	“because they argued with him {about it}.” or “because they disputed/argued with his herdsmen {about it}.” The herdsmen from Gerar disputed with Isaac indirectly (verse 20b) when they quarreled with his herdsmen (verse 20a). Make sure in your translation that the two halves of this verse do not contradict each other.

Notice that in the first two alternate translations, the “us” or the “we” exclude him, but in the third alternate translation, the “we” includes him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
GEN	26	28	h1wx	figs-exclusive	וְ⁠נִכְרְתָ֥ה בְרִ֖ית	1	So let us cut a covenant	“So {please} let us make/establish a {peace} treaty/agreement”. See how you translated “cut a covenant” in Gen 21:27, 32. Notice that the pronoun “us” in this phrase either excludes Isaac or includes him, depending on whether you use “with you” or “with each other” for the following phrase. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

For some languages it may be necessary to make explicit more of the steps that Esau needs to take to prepare the meal, so that it does not sound like the animal would be eaten alive or uncooked. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

The phrase “his son” probably recalls the fact that Esau was Isaac’s favorite son (Gen 25:28). However make sure that your translation of this phrase does not sound like Esau was not also Rebekah’s son. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	27	5	oslq		וַ⁠יֵּ֤לֶךְ עֵשָׂו֙ הַ⁠שָּׂדֶ֔ה לָ⁠צ֥וּד צַ֖יִד לְ⁠הָבִֽיא	1	then Esau went {to} the field to hunt game to bring it back.	“So after Esau went out to the fields/country to hunt/get {wild} animal/deer {meat},” or “So after Esau had left to go hunting in the open country,” Consider whether it is more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here that continues into verse 6. Also see how you translated “the field” and “hunt game” in verse 3.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])
GEN	27	8	drc0		וְ⁠עַתָּ֥ה בְנִ֖⁠י	1	So now, my son,	“So then, my son,” or “Now son,” See how you translated “So now” in verse 3. Also, make sure it is clear that Rebekah is no longer quoting Isaac’s words (whether directly or indirectly). If necessary, you could begin this verse with: “Rebekah continued,” or “Then Rebekah said {to Jacob},”

GEN	27	12	d3vv	figs-hypo	וְ⁠הָיִ֥יתִי בְ⁠עֵינָ֖י⁠ו כִּ⁠מְתַעְתֵּ֑עַ	1	Then I will be in his eyes as a deceiver,	“{Certainly} he will/would {recognize me and} know/realize that I am trying to deceive/trick him.” Make sure that your translation of verse 12 describes a hypothetical situation, not something that had happened yet. Some languages have a special verb form (such as “would”) to communicate this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
GEN	27	12	i8j5		וְ⁠הֵבֵאתִ֥י עָלַ֛⁠י קְלָלָ֖ה וְ⁠לֹ֥א בְרָכָֽה	1	and I will bring a curse on me and not a blessing.”	“Then I will/would cause myself to be cursed instead of blessed.” or “Then he will curse me instead of bless me.”

Also, for some languages it is more natural to put an address like “my son” first in this quote. Do what is best in your language.

Jacob is claiming those rights by using this term. See how you translated this term in Gen 25:13. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms]])

GEN	27	36	exic		יַעֲקֹ֗ב	1	Jacob	In order to help readers understand why Esau said this about Jacob, some translations include a footnote like the following: The name “Jacob” means “heel-grabber” and can imply deception. He was given that name because when he was born, he was grabbing hold of Esau’s heel (Genesis 25:26).

A yoke is a wooden collar that is placed around the necks of work animals to control them as they pull a plow or cart. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Consider whether it is more natural in your language to end this sentence here or to continue the sentence into verse 45. Also, the phrase “turns away” is used here as an idiom that means “becomes less” or “goes away”. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

Most translation teams translate the meaning of God’s title here (for example, “God Almighty”). Other teams transliterate the title as “El Shaddai” (as if it were a name) and put the meaning of the title in a footnote. See how you handled “God Almighty” in Gen 17:1.

Also see how you translated “to Paddan Aram” in verses 2 and 5. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])

It may be more natural to move “Abraham’s son” earlier in this sentence and say, “So/Then Esau went to {the family of} Abraham’s son Ishmael and married Ishmael’s daughter Mahalath, whose brother was Nebaioth.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])

Since Nebaioth was Ishmael’s oldest child, Mahalath was his younger sister, probably from the same mother. Use a kinship term here in your language for “sister” or “brother” that fits with those facts. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
GEN	28	9	ms4d	figs-infostructure	עַל נָשָׁ֖י⁠ו ל֥⁠וֹ	1	in addition to his wives {who belonged} to him.	“besides the {two} wives he already had.” Consider whether it is better in your language to put this phrase earlier in this sentence and say, “So, in addition to the {two} wives he already had, Esau...” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])

Verse 10 refers back to verse 5, where Jacob had left his parents’ home in Beersheba to go to Paddan Aram. Make sure your translation does not sound like he left a second time here in verse 10. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	28	10	claa	figs-explicit	חָרָֽנָ⁠ה	1	Haran.	“{the city of} Haran {in the region/land of Paddan Aram}.” Make sure it is clear in your translation that Jacob was heading toward the same place that his father had told him to go to in verse 2. The author assumed here that his audience knew that Haran was a city located in the Paddan Aram region. It may be helpful to include a map in your translation that shows the locations of the city of Haran and the region of Paddan Aram. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

GEN	28	11	o0vc	figs-infostructure	כִּי בָ֣א הַ⁠שֶּׁ֔מֶשׁ	1	because the sun had gone.	“because the sun had gone {down}.” or “because the sun had set.” For some languages it is more natural to put the information in this clause first in this sentence and say, “After the sun went down, he reached a good place {to camp/sleep}, so he stopped/stayed there {for the night}.” Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])

The way you translate “stone” should refer to something that would be large enough to support Jacob’s head, but not so large that it would be too heavy for him to lift. For example in English, a pebble is too small and a boulder is too big.
GEN	28	11	jfsc		וַ⁠יָּ֖שֶׂם מְרַֽאֲשֹׁתָ֑י⁠ו	1	and put it under his head,	“and rested his head on it {as a headrest/pillow}” or “and used it as a headrest/pillow” or “to use as a headrest/pillow”

The phrase for “above it” in the Hebrew text is ambiguous. It could mean: 1) “above it” or “at the top {of the stairway}”; or 2) “above/beside him/Jacob”. The interpretation that is not followed in your translation could be put in a footnote.

Do what is natural in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	28	14	z6v3		וְ⁠הָיָ֤ה זַרְעֲ⁠ךָ֙	1	And your offspring will be	“And your descendants will be” or “They will be” or “You will have so many descendants that they will be”

Notice that they are in a different order there.

Rather the focus is on the period of time between now when God is speaking to Jacob and the time later on when Jacob would see the fulfillment of God’s promises to him.

The word “pillar” refers here to a stone that is used to commemorate something. In this case, Jacob used a stone to mark and help him remember the place where God had appeared to him.

Make sure that the way you translate “oil” does not refer to motor oil. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

Since Jacob is making this vow to God, for some languages it is more natural to address God directly (as “you”) throughout verses 20-22, rather than only in the last half of verse 22 (as the Hebrew text does). Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

The way you translate this phrase should reflect that fact that Jacob’s journey from his home to the city of Haran was about 725 kilometers (450 miles) long.

See how you translated “east” in Gen 28:14.
GEN	29	2	xoz6	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יַּ֞רְא	1	And he looked	“Then he looked {around}” or “{When he arrived/got there,} he looked {around}” or “{When he arrived at a place near the city of Haran,} he looked {around}”. Jacob was now near the city of Haran (verse 4) which was in the land east of Canaan (verse 1). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	29	2	sbb1		וְ⁠הִנֵּ֧ה בְאֵ֣ר בַּ⁠שָּׂדֶ֗ה	1	and behold, a well {was} in the field,	“and saw a well in an {open} field/area” or “and there in an {open} field/area {was} a well”. The word “field” refers to an open area of land, not a fenced-in area. See how you translated this term in Gen 25:27, 29.
GEN	29	2	ooui		וְ⁠הִנֵּה שָׁ֞ם שְׁלֹשָׁ֤ה עֶדְרֵי צֹאן֙ רֹבְצִ֣ים	1	and behold, three flocks of sheep were lying there	“He saw three flocks of sheep that were lying {down}” or “There were three flocks of sheep lying {down}”.

You could include here in your translation a picture of a well with a round, flat stone covering it. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

GEN	29	3	sx1s		וְ⁠גָלֲל֤וּ אֶת הָ⁠אֶ֨בֶן֙ מֵ⁠עַל֙	1	roll the stone from over	“roll/take the stone off” or “remove the stone from”. Be consistent here with how you translated “stone” in verse 2.

GEN	29	4	y5g6		אַחַ֖⁠י	1	“My brothers,	“My friends,” or “Friends,” This is a polite, friendly idiom used as a greeting; it does not mean that the shepherds were actually Jacob’s relatives. Many languages have a similar greeting. (See; figs-idiom)

GEN	29	5	xm8y	figs-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר לָ⁠הֶ֔ם	1	Then he said to them,	“So Jacob asked them,” or “So Jacob asked,” Consider what is the most natural way in your language to translate quote margins in a conversation that goes back and forth quickly like the one in verses 4-8. After the conversation gets started, it often sounds more life-like and natural to shorten the quote margins and leave implied some of the references to the people who are being talked to (as long as it is still clear who is talking to whom). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]])

For some languages it sounds too rude for Jacob to make a direct command here, so it is better to make this a suggestion, or even a rhetorical question. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness]])
GEN	29	7	i11c		וּ⁠לְכ֥וּ רְעֽוּ	1	and go pasture {them}.”	“and/then take {them} {back} out {to the fields} to graze {some more}.” or “then you can take them out to eat {more} grass.”

In that culture it was common to greet a relative with a kiss on the cheek (or both cheeks). However, if it would be offensive in your culture for Jacob to kiss Rachel here, you could translate this more generally (see the second alternate translation above). Also see how you translated “kiss” in Gen 27:26-27.
GEN	29	11	f2sd		וַ⁠יִּשָּׂ֥א אֶת קֹל֖⁠וֹ וַ⁠יֵּֽבְךְּ	1	and lifted his voice and cried.	“and he started crying aloud/loudly {because he was so happy}.” or “and {he was so happy that} he started crying.” See how you translated the idiom “lifted his voice” in Gen 27:38. However, here Jacob is crying because he is happy, not upset. Make sure that is clear in your translation.

Also make sure that Jacob’s request here sounds polite in your translation, not rude or demanding. It should also not sound like he was begging or pleading. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])

GEN	29	23	segg	writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יָּבֹ֖א	1	and he	“and/so he/Jacob” or “so that he/Jacob”. Make sure it is clear in your translation that “he” refers here to Jacob, not Laban. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	29	23	w6z3	figs-euphemism	וַ⁠יָּבֹ֖א אֵלֶֽי⁠הָ	1	went to her.	“had marital/sexual relations with her/Leah.” or “slept with her/Leah.” or “spent the night with her/Leah.” See how you translated the euphemism “went to” in Gen 16:4 (and “go to” in Gen 16:2 and 29:21). Translate this in a way that is natural, clear, and acceptable for reading in public. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
GEN	29	24	r88g		וַ⁠יִּתֵּ֤ן לָבָן֙	1	And Laban gave	“Laban also gave” or “In addition, Laban gave”. It is not clear in the Hebrew text when Laban gave Zilpah to Leah, so it is probably best to keep it that way in your translation. Some translations say that Laban “had {already} given” Zilpah to Leah before the wedding night. However according to Jewish history (outside the Bible), it was on the wedding night that Laban did this as part of his plan to deceive Jacob -- Zilpah was younger than Bilhah, so everyone would expect her to be given to Rachel as the younger sister; seeing Zilpah (instead of Bilhah) would help Jacob think that his veiled bride was Rachel. Since we do not know for sure which interpretation is right, it is probably best to be like the Hebrew text and not specify when Laban gave Zilpah to Leah. Some translations put this verse in parentheses because it seems to interrupt the telling of the main events.
GEN	29	24	ekwu		לָ֔⁠הּ אֶת זִלְפָּ֖ה שִׁפְחָת֑⁠וֹ לְ⁠לֵאָ֥ה בִתּ֖⁠וֹ	1	to her Zilpah his maidservant, to Leah his daughter,	“his female servant Zilpah to Leah” or “to Leah a female servant named Zilpah”

Also, make sure that your translation of “she” refers here to Leah, not Zilpah (who was mentioned in verse 24). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	29	25	sbym	figs-honorifics	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֶל לָבָ֗ן	1	So he said to Laban,	“So/Then he/Jacob complained to {his father-in-law} Laban,” or “So/Then he/Jacob rebuked/confronted Laban and said,” Some languages use an honorific title such as “his father-in-law” here now that Jacob is married. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-honorifics]])

Consider the best way to do that in your language. Also see how you translated this question in Gen 12:18, 20:9, 26:10. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

For some languages it is necessary to say what the custom is, rather than what it is not. For example, you could say, “Our custom/practice here is to wait until the firstborn/oldest daughter is married before we let the younger daughter(s)/one(s) get married.” Do what is best in your language.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	30	6	ttgy		דָּנַ֣⁠נִּי אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	“God has vindicated me,	“God has judged in my favor!” Some translations have “judged me” here. However, make sure your translation of this phrase has a positive meaning (making a decision in Rachel’s favor) and not a negative meaning (condemning her).
GEN	30	6	lxn8		וְ⁠גַם֙ שָׁמַ֣ע בְּ⁠קֹלִ֔⁠י וַ⁠יִּתֶּן לִ֖⁠י בֵּ֑ן	1	and indeed, he has listened to my voice and given to me a son!”	“Yes indeed, he has heard/answered my prayer/request/plea and given me a son!”

GEN	30	6	igoe		קָרְאָ֥ה שְׁמ֖⁠וֹ	1	she called his name	“she called/named him” or “she gave him the name” or “she named her baby/son”. Make sure it is clear here in your translation that Rachel is naming Bilhah’s son, not God (who was the subject of the previous sentence). See how you translated “called his name” in Gen 29:32.
GEN	30	6	f22p	translate-names	דָּֽן	1	Dan.	“Dan, {which means “he vindicated.”}” or “Dan, {which means “he judged in my favor.”}” If you include the meaning of Dan’s name in your translation (or in a footnote), make sure it matches the way you translated “he has vindicated” earlier in this verse.

It could mean (1) “I have had a mighty/difficult struggle/contest with my sister” or “I have struggled intensely/hard with/against my sister”. That would be the meaning if the Hebrew word “elohim” in this phrase is used as an adjective that means “mighty/powerful”. (2) “I have wrestled/struggled with God because of my sister”, which could refer to a struggle against her sister praying to God for children. That would be the meaning if the word “elohim” in this phrase means “God”.

GEN	30	13	e0y4		בְּ⁠אָשְׁרִ֕⁠י	1	“How blessed I am!	“I am truly/greatly blessed!” or “{God} has truly/greatly blessed me!” Although many translations have “happy” in this verse instead of “blessed”, the Hebrew noun (and the verb it is based on) is more general and has to do with a person’s blessed state (which results in joy and happiness). The same Hebrew word is used in Psalm 1:1, and the equivalent Greek word is used in Luke 1:48 and Matthew 5:3-11.
GEN	30	13	toow		כִּ֥י אִשְּׁר֖וּ⁠נִי בָּנ֑וֹת	1	For women will call me blessed.”	“Now {other} women will say that I am blessed.” or “Now {other} women will say that {God} has blessed me.”

Consider whether or not rhetorical questions are the best way to communicate that in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

The word “divination” refers to trying to find out information by looking at signs (omens) and interpreting them either by God’s power (Gen 44:5, 15) or by witchcraft and false gods (Ezekiel 21:21). Laban may have consulted his household gods (mentioned in Gen 31:19, 30). It could also be that Laban meant that he had figured this out simply by observing how God had blessed him through Jacob’s expert tending of his flocks.

However it could be that there was a pause in the conversation, or the author may want to show that there is a change in topic or emphasize what is said next. So if possible, it is best to keep the quote margin here in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])

In that part of the world, most sheep were white and most goats were solid brown or black. So Jacob was asking for the irregular animals for himself, including white sheep with dark marks, dark-colored goats with light marks and dark-colored lambs. You could put some of this information in a footnote.

In the Hebrew text, there is a pun (play-on-words) in verses 35 and 37: the name “Laban” means “white”, so verse 35 literally says that any goats with “Laban” (“white”) on them became Jacob’s. You could include that information in a footnote.

The term “livestock” usually includes all kinds of domestic animals, but in this context it refers to the sheep and goats that Jacob was taking care of for Laban.

Sometimes an angel says “I” as God’s representative, but in this context, it seems to be Yahweh himself (in the form of an angel) who is speaking to Jacob (see verse 13). That information could be put in a footnote, and you could make “Yahweh” explicit in the text to make that clear. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

This rhetorical question expects the answer “no”. It also expresses Rachel and Leah’s strong emotion and emphasizes that there is nothing for them to inherit from their father. Consider whether or not a rhetorical question fits well here in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
GEN	31	14	pkpj		בְּ⁠בֵ֥ית אָבִֽי⁠נוּ	1	in the house of our father?	“from our father’s house/estate {when he dies}!” or “from our father {when he dies}”

Consider whether or not it is natural in your language to use a rhetorical question here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
GEN	31	15	s8wr		נָכְרִיּ֛וֹת	1	{as} foreigners?	“like foreigners/strangers {not family}” or “as if we were foreigners/strangers {instead of family}”
GEN	31	15	omu6		כִּ֣י מְכָרָ֑⁠נוּ	1	For he sold us,	“For example, he sold us {to you},” or “After all, he sold us {to you},” This sentence is an example of how Laban treated his daughters like foreigners.
GEN	31	15	mxan	figs-idiom	וַ⁠יֹּ֥אכַל גַּם אָכ֖וֹל	1	and he has indeed completely eaten up	“and then he spent all” or “and then he used up all”. The phrase “eaten up” is used here as an idiom that means Laban had spent or kept for himself all the wealth he had gained from Jacob’s 14 years of working for him. Many languages have a similar idiom that could be used here. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	31	15	gm7a	translate-unknown	אֶת כַּסְפֵּֽ⁠נוּ	1	our silver.	“the money/wealth that should have been ours.” or “the money/wealth that belonged to us.” In that culture at that time, silver was a currency used to buy and sell things. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

The word “livestock” is general here and includes all of Jacob’s animals.
GEN	31	18	il9b		בְּ⁠פַדַּ֣ן אֲרָ֑ם	1	in Paddan Aram,	“{while living} in {the land/region of} Paddan Aram,” Be consistent here with how you translated “{the land/region of} Paddan Aram” in Gen 25:20.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	31	19	v4xu	writing-background	וְ⁠לָבָ֣ן	1	Now Laban	“Now {before that,} Laban {the Aramean}”. Make sure it is clear in your translation that the events in verse 19 happened before Jacob and his family had left. Also, for some languages it is more natural to first make “the Aramean” explicit here in verse 19, rather than wait until verse 20. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
GEN	31	19	kjcg		הָלַ֔ךְ לִ⁠גְזֹ֖ז אֶת צֹאנ֑⁠וֹ	1	had gone to shear his sheep,	“had gone away {for several days} to cut the wool off his sheep”. In that culture, sheep wool was very important since it was used to make clothing and blankets. The process of shearing many sheep would have taken several days. You could include some of this information in a footnote.
GEN	31	19	to0b		וַ⁠תִּגְנֹ֣ב רָחֵ֔ל	1	so Rachel	“so {while he was gone,} Rachel” or “{While he was gone,} Rachel”. Consider whether it is more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here.

These idols were statues made of wood or precious metals. They were small enough to be used in a private home. In this chapter these statues are referred to as “idols” (in verses 19, 34, 35 when the author refers to them) and “gods” (in quotes in verses 30 and 32 when Laban or Jacob talk about them). If it is confusing in your language to switch back and forth between these two terms, you could use “gods” throughout this chapter, since Laban would not have called them idols, nor would Jacob have used that term in his presence. However, if possible, it is best to translate the two terms the way the Hebrew text has them. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
GEN	31	20	k66g	figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּגְנֹ֣ב יַעֲקֹ֔ב אֶת לֵ֥ב	1	and Jacob stole the heart of	“and Jacob deceived/tricked” or “At the same time, Jacob deceived/tricked”. Consider whether it is more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	31	20	apv4		לָבָ֖ן הָ⁠אֲרַמִּ֑י	1	Laban the Aramean	“Laban/him”. If you used “Aramean” earlier (verse 19), it may not be natural here. Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated this phrase in Gen 25:20.

GEN	31	21	bfj5		וַ⁠יִּבְרַ֥ח הוּא֙	1	And he fled	“So Jacob {and his family} ran away” or “So {in that way} Jacob ran away {with his family}”. This statement summarizes an event that already happened (see verses 18 and 20). Make sure your translation of this verse does not sound like Jacob left a second time. To make this clear you could say, “After Jacob {and his family} ran away with everything that they owned, they {quickly} crossed the {Euphrates} River and headed toward the hill country of Gilead.”
GEN	31	21	v5kc		וְ⁠כָל	1	and all	“with all/everything” or “and {took/brought} all/everything”
GEN	31	21	ksn6	writing-pronouns	אֲשֶׁר ל֔⁠וֹ	1	that {belonged} to him.	“that {belonged} to them.” or “that he/they had/owned.” Make sure that your choice of pronouns throughout this verse fits with how you translate the beginning of this sentence.

Verse 27 is one long rhetorical question in the Hebrew text that expresses Laban’s anger at Jacob. For some languages, it is better to break it up into two or more sentences.

Make sure you translate “my lord” in a way that is appropriate for a daughter to show respect to her father; it should not sound like she was Laban’s slave or servant. The word “burn” is used here as an idiom that means to be angry. Consider whether your language has a similar idiom that would work well here. Also see how you translated this idiom in Gen 30:2.

You could put that information in a footnote.

The phrase “the Fear of Isaac” is a title for God that is ambiguous in Hebrew (and English). It could mean: 1) “the One/God whom Isaac fears/reveres”; or 2) “Isaac’s God whom {people/others} are afraid/terrified of”. The interpretation that is not used in your translation could be put in a footnote. Make sure it is clear in your translation that Jacob is only talking about one God in this verse, not two or three. Also notice that “my father” and “Isaac” both refer to Jacob’s father Isaac, not two different people.
GEN	31	42	uo50	figs-hypo	לוּלֵ֡י הָ֣יָה לִ֔⁠י	1	had not been with me,	“had not been with me {taking care of me},” or “had not been with me {protecting me and guiding me},” Make sure it is clear in your translation that the events in this sentence are contrary-to-fact (hypothetical).

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
GEN	31	43	ezl8	figs-rquestion	וְ⁠לִ⁠בְנֹתַ֞⁠י מָֽה אֶֽעֱשֶׂ֤ה הַ⁠יּ֔וֹם	1	But what can I do today	“But/Yet there is nothing I can do today/now” or “But I can’t do anything now”. Laban uses this rhetorical question to express his emotions and emphasize that there is nothing that he can do. Consider whether or not a rhetorical question fits well here in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated “So now” in verse 16 and “cut a covenant” in Gen 26:28. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	31	44	r8h5		וְ⁠הָיָ֥ה	1	and let it be	“and let there be” or “and there should be”. The subject of the Hebrew verb in this phrase is masculine singular, so it cannot refer to “covenant”, which is feminine singular. It is probably best to translate this phrase in a more general way (see the alternate translations above).
GEN	31	44	r3fk	figs-exclusive	לְ⁠עֵ֖ד בֵּינִ֥⁠י וּ⁠בֵינֶֽ⁠ךָ	1	a witness between me and you.”	“a witness/memorial to remind us {of our treaty/covenant}.” or “something to remind us {to keep that covenant/treaty}.” If your language has a dual pronoun for “us”, you could use it in this verse. Also, if your language distinguishes exclusive and inclusive pronouns, you could use the inclusive form of “us” here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

GEN	31	46	zsng	figs-politeness	לִקְט֣וּ אֲבָנִ֔ים	1	“Gather stones.”	“Gather {some more} stones.” or “{Please} gather {some} stones.” Make sure that your translation of Jacob’s request sounds polite here, not rude or demanding, but also not begging. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-politeness]])

Make sure that is clear in your language. See how you translated this idiom in Gen 11:9.
GEN	31	49	koag		וְ⁠הַ⁠מִּצְפָּה֙	1	{It is} also Mizpah,	“{It is/was} also {called/named} Mizpah,” or “People also call {the place,} Mizpah,” or “{Another name for the place is} Mizpah, {which means “watchtower,”}”

Abraham trusted in Yahweh, the one and only true God (Gen 15:6). Terah worshiped other gods (Joshua 24:2), and so did Laban (verses 19, 30), which suggests that Nahor served the same gods that his father Terah served, and then taught his son Laban to do the same thing. In spite of that, many translations still capitalize “God” all three times here in verse 53. Be consistent here with how you spelled “Nahor” in Gen 29:5 and 31:53.
GEN	31	53	je1o		יִשְׁפְּט֣וּ בֵינֵ֔י⁠נוּ	1	judge between us!”	“judge between us {and punish us if we break this/our covenant/treaty}!”

See how you translated “swore” in Gen 26:31, and compare that to how you translated a related phrase (“vowed a vow”) in 31:13. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-key-term]])
GEN	31	53	lfkw		בְּ⁠פַ֖חַד אָבִ֥י⁠ו יִצְחָֽק	1	by the Fear of his father Isaac,	“by the God whom his father Isaac feared/revered, {that he would keep their treaty,}” or “with the Fear/God of his father Isaac as his witness/enforcer,” See how you translated “the Fear of Isaac” in verse 42.
GEN	31	54	sa23		וַ⁠יִּזְבַּ֨ח יַעֲקֹ֥ב זֶ֨בַח֙	1	and Jacob sacrificed a sacrifice	“and Jacob/he offered an animal sacrifice {to God} {on an altar}” or “and Jacob/he burned {the body of} an animal {on an altar} as a sacrifice {to God}”. Make sure your translation does not sound like Jacob burned the animal while it was still alive. Also see how you translated “sacrificed” in Gen 22:13.

In this context, it was a meal that they shared together. Make sure that is clear in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
GEN	31	54	n9ic	translate-symaction	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אכְלוּ לֶ֔חֶם וַ⁠יָּלִ֖ינוּ בָּ⁠הָֽר	1	Then they ate bread and spent the night on the mountain.	“Then after they had eaten the meal, they spent the night {there} on the/that mountain/hill.” or “So they {all} ate the meal {together} and spent the night there.” As in Genesis 26:30, eating together was an important part of the covenant or treaty process, since it shows unity and close relationship as if they were part of the same family. Some of that information could be included in a footnote. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
GEN	31	55	b7v7		וַ⁠יַּשְׁכֵּ֨ם לָבָ֜ן בַּ⁠בֹּ֗קֶר	1	Then in the morning Laban got up early	“The next morning Laban got up early” or “Early the next morning Laban got up”. See how you translated a similar clause in Gen 28:18.

See how you translated a similar clause in verse 28.

The Jabbok Stream was a small river that flowed from east to west into the Jordan River about halfway between the Dead Sea and the Sea of Galilee. Jacob took his wives and children from the north side of the stream to the south side; his brother was coming towards them from further south. It might be helpful to include a map here in your translation that includes the places named in this chapter and shows where Jacob and Esau were coming from.

Make sure your translation does not sound like Jacob’s wives and children crossed the Jabbok Stream twice in verses 22-23.
GEN	32	23	cu8k	figs-explicit	וַֽ⁠יַּעֲבֵ֖ר	1	he sent	“he {went back and} had his servants take”. At some point, Jacob went back to the north side of the Jabbok Stream, while his family waited for him on the south side. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	32	23	zqp3		אֶת אֲשֶׁר ל⁠וֹ	1	what {belonged} to him	“{all} his {livestock/animals and other} belongings/possessions” or “{everything} that he owned”. These belongings included the animals that Jacob had not sent ahead to Esau, as well as all his other possessions.

At some point, Jacob realized that this man was Yahweh in the form of a man (verse 30), so translation teams that capitalize references to God capitalize all the pronouns that refer to him in verses 24-29, and may or may not capitalize “Man” in these verses. See what you did for a similar case when Yahweh appeared as a man to Abraham in Gen 18. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-honorifics]])
GEN	32	24	xp7g		עַ֖ד עֲל֥וֹת הַ⁠שָּֽׁחַר	1	until the dawn came up.	“until dawn/daybreak.” or “until daylight started to appear.” The word “dawn” refers to the time before sunrise when the sky begins to get light.

After that, Abraham and Sarah were no longer called by their previous names. In the case of Jacob, he continues to be referred to by both of his names in this chapter (“Jacob” in verses 29-30, 32; “Israel” in verse 32) and throughout the rest of the Bible, including by God (Gen 46:2). It could be that although God was changing Jacob’s primary name to “Israel”, he was still known by his previous name too. You could put some of that information in a footnote.
GEN	32	28	a7a1	translate-names	כִּ֖י אִם יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל	1	but Israel,	“but {rather} {it will be} Israel, {which means “he who struggles/contends with God,”}” If you include the meaning of the name “Israel” in your translation or in a footnote, make sure it fits with how you translate “struggled” in the following clause. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
GEN	32	28	qtn7		כִּֽי שָׂרִ֧יתָ עִם אֱלֹהִ֛ים וְ⁠עִם אֲנָשִׁ֖ים	1	because you have struggled with God and with men,	“because you have struggled/contended with/against {both} God and men/people,” The Hebrew word for “struggled” here is more general than the word for “wrestled” in verses 24 and 25.
GEN	32	28	rv8r		וַ⁠תּוּכָֽל	1	and you have prevailed.”	“and you have won/overcome.” See how you translated “prevailed” in verse 25 and Gen 30:8. It may be necessary to translate this term in slightly differently ways, depending on the context.
GEN	32	29	xmf8	grammar-honorifics	וַ⁠יִּשְׁאַ֣ל יַעֲקֹ֗ב וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר֙	1	Then Jacob asked and said,	“Then Jacob asked him” or “Then Jacob asked the man”.

This rhetorical question probably means that there was no need for Jacob to ask the man what his name was; he should have known without asking. Consider whether or not it is best to use a rhetorical question here in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
GEN	32	29	su43		לִ⁠שְׁמִ֑⁠י	1	for my name?”	“{me} to tell you my name!” or “{me} what my name is!”

You could put that information in a footnote so that readers understand why Jacob was surprised.
GEN	32	31	qmee		וַ⁠יִּֽזְרַֽח ל֣⁠וֹ הַ⁠שֶּׁ֔מֶשׁ	1	And the sun rose on him	“The sun shined on Jacob” or “The sun was rising/shining”

That information could be put in a footnote. Or you could use the same spelling in both verses to avoid confusion; “Penuel” is the spelling in the rest of the Old Testament. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
GEN	32	31	a26l		וְ⁠ה֥וּא צֹלֵ֖עַ	1	and he was limping	“He was limping {as he walked}” or “{As he walked,} he was limping”. Consider whether it is more natural in your language to begin a new sentence here.

Make sure your translation of this idiom does not mean that Jacob looked straight up, rather he probably looked carefully to the south (the direction that his brother was coming from). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

Make sure that the way you translate “fell on his neck” does not imply that Esau accidentally fell. Rather, this is an idiom that means he embraced Jacob warmly, with much emotion.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	33	9	zyb8	writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֥אמֶר עֵשָׂ֖ו	1	Then Esau said,	“But Esau replied,” or “Esau said/replied {to him},” What Esau says is in contrast to what Jacob said, but it may not be necessary to use a conjunction here at all. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	33	9	ox9e	figs-infostructure	יֶשׁ לִ֣⁠י רָ֑ב אָחִ֕⁠י	1	“I have plenty, my brother.	“My brother, I {already} have/own enough {livestock/animals}”. For some languages it is more natural to put the address “my brother” first in this quote. Some languages also have a special term for “younger brother” that fits well here. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	33	9	n2sw		יְהִ֥י לְ⁠ךָ֖ אֲשֶׁר לָֽ⁠ךְ	1	Let what {belongs} to you be yours.”	“Keep what you have/own for yourself.” or “{so} keep your livestock/animals for yourself.” or “{so} keep them for yourself.”

GEN	33	10	nzwn		אַל נָא֙	1	“No, please.	“No, I beg you.” or “Please don’t refuse {my gift}.” In verses 10 and 11, Jacob speaks urgently to Esau, because in that culture if Esau accepts Jacob’s gift, he is committing himself to treat Jacob as a friend.
GEN	33	10	jjit		אִם נָ֨א מָצָ֤אתִי חֵן֙ בְּ⁠עֵינֶ֔י⁠ךָ וְ⁠לָקַחְתָּ֥	1	If, please, I have found favor in your eyes, then	“{Rather} if you are pleased with me,” or “{Rather} if you want to be gracious/kind to me, then”. See how you translated the idiom “find/gain favor in your eyes” in verse 8.

In Old Testament times it was terrifying for someone to see God in person, because normally people could not see God’s face and live (Exodus 33:20). However, God had been gracious to Jacob and allowed him to live (Genesis 32:30). In the same way, it was a terrifying thing for Jacob to see Esau who had 400 men with him, but Esau was gracious to him (33:4). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])
GEN	33	10	b8oh		וַ⁠תִּרְצֵֽ⁠נִי	1	you have received me.	“you have received/welcomed me {so kindly/warmly}.” or “you {forgave me and} welcomed me!” See how you translated a different Hebrew word that means “receive” or “welcome” in Gen 32:20.

GEN	33	12	ayif		וְ⁠אֵלְכָ֖ה לְ⁠נֶגְדֶּֽ⁠ךָ	1	and I will go in front of you.”	“and I will lead/accompany/escort you.” Esau is suggesting that he would accompany or escort Jacob and his family, not that he would go far ahead of them.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
GEN	33	14	vkhx	figs-honorifics	יַעֲבָר נָ֥א אֲדֹנִ֖⁠י לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י עַבְדּ֑⁠וֹ	1	Please let my lord go on before his servant,	“{So then,} sir, please go on {home} ahead of me, sir.” See how you translated Jacob’s use of “my lord” (in verse 8) and “servant” (in verse 5) to show respect and deference to Esau. Here he uses both terms for emphasis. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-honorifics]])

GEN	33	14	a2ys		שֵׂעִֽירָ⁠ה	1	in Seir.”	“in {the land/region of} Seir.” See how you translated “the land of Seir” in Gen 32:3. The land of Seir was a mountainous region southeast of the land of Canaan (and the Dead Sea) and was where Esau had settled. It was also called “Edom” (Gen 32:3), which was Esau’s nickname (Gen 25:30). You could put some of that information in a footnote.

GEN	33	15	fgtd	figs-rquestion	לָ֣⁠מָּה זֶּ֔ה	1	“Why {do} that?	“There’s no need for that.” or “There is no need {for you} to do that.” Jacob uses a rhetorical question here to emphasize that there is no need for Esau to leave any of his men with him. For some languages it is clearer and more natural to use a statement here instead. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
GEN	33	15	udd7	figs-honorifics	אֶמְצָא חֵ֖ן בְּ⁠עֵינֵ֥י אֲדֹנִֽ⁠י	1	Let me find favor in the eyes of my lord.”	“{Just} please {continue to} be gracious/kind to me, sir.” or “Sir, please {just} {continue to} treat me kindly.” Consider again how you translated “my lord” in verses 8,13-15. For some languages it is more natural to put this address earlier in this quote. Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated the idiom “find favor in the eyes of” in verse 8.

Jacob went northwest to Succoth, instead of going south to the region of Seir as he had said he would do (verse 14). Also see how you translated “travel” in verse 12.

If you include the meaning of the name Succoth in your translation or in a footnote, make sure it matches the way you translate “shelters” earlier in this verse.

GEN	33	18	lwf7		וַ⁠יִּ֖חַן	1	and he camped	“and he/they set up camp {in a field}” or “Then he/they set up his/their tents {in a field}”. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin a new sentence here. See how you translated “camped” in Gen 26:17.

One of Hamor’s sons was named Shechem.” or “for/with one hundred pieces {of silver/money} from the sons of Hamor {who was} the father of Shechem.” The weight and value of a hundred kesitahs of silver is not known. Some ancient translations (including the LXX and Latin Vulgate) have “a hundred lambs” here, but most modern translations have “a hundred pieces of silver/money”. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

You could put that information in a footnote. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
GEN	34	1	f4bk	writing-newevent	וַ⁠תֵּצֵ֤א דִינָה֙	1	Then Dinah,	“Then/Now {one day} Dinah,” or “{One day,} Dinah,” These events took place at an unspecified time after Jacob and his family set up their camp beside the city of Shechem (Gen 33:18). Consider what is the best way to introduce a new event in your language. Also be consistent here with how you spelled “Dinah” in Gen 30:21. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])

GEN	34	1	nx1k	figs-idiom	וַ⁠תֵּצֵ֤א לִ⁠רְא֖וֹת	1	went out to see	“went {to/into the city} to visit {with}”. The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. The verb “to see”: 1. could be used here as an idiom that means “to visit”; many languages have a similar idiom; or 2. could literally mean that Dinah went “to see/observe” the local women, for example, how they dressed and what jewelry they wore. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	34	1	h2og		בִּ⁠בְנ֥וֹת הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	the daughters of the land.	“{some of} the women who were native to that area/region.” or “{some of} the local/native women.” See how you translated “daughters of the land” in Gen 27:46, and how you translated a similar phrase (“people of the land”) in Gen 23:7, 12.

His son Shechem”. Consider which order of phrases is best here in your language. Also see how you translated “Hivites” in Gen 10:17 and “ruler” in Gen 25:16.

Translate this in a way that will not offend or embarrass people, especially when hearing your translation read aloud. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])

The negotiations would include a bride-price and other details. You could put some of that information in a footnote. The term “girl” that Shechem uses here is less respectful than the term “young woman” that is used in verses 3 and 12.

GEN	34	5	xls9		וְ⁠הֶחֱרִ֥שׁ יַעֲקֹ֖ב	1	so Jacob kept quiet	“so he didn’t say anything {about it}” or “so he didn’t tell anyone {about it}”. Make sure your translation of this phrase does not mean that Jacob was totally silent. Rather, it means he did not speak about what Shechem had done to Dinah.
GEN	34	5	ansf		עַד בֹּאָֽ⁠ם	1	until they came.	“until they came {back} {home}.” or “until they returned {home}.”

For some languages it is more natural to introduce Shechem here, rather than wait and have him appear too suddenly in verse 11. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	34	6	qre7		אֶֽל יַעֲקֹ֑ב לְ⁠דַבֵּ֖ר אִתּֽ⁠וֹ	1	to Jacob to talk with him.	“to talk to Jacob.” or “to Jacob’s {camp/tent} to talk with/to him.”

However, unless someone else told Jacob’s sons the news of what happened, that interpretation contradicts verse 5, which says that Jacob kept quiet about it until his sons got home.
GEN	34	7	u50r		וַ⁠יִּֽתְעַצְּבוּ֙ הָֽ⁠אֲנָשִׁ֔ים	1	the men were grieved	“they were {very} distressed/shocked”. See how you translated “grieved” in Gen 6:6. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.

Notice that the Hebrew text has both of Jacob’s names in verse 7, “Jacob” and “Israel”, to emphasize that Shechem had sinned against Jacob and all of his descendants (the people of Israel). You could put that information in a footnote. Make sure that your translation of “Israel” does not refer here to a place, since Israel was not yet a country or a territory.

Also see the note about this at verse 4.
GEN	34	9	is3w		וְ⁠הִֽתְחַתְּנ֖וּ אֹתָ֑⁠נוּ	1	And intermarry with us:	“{In fact,} let’s allow marriage between our two people groups,” or “Let’s agree to let members of our families marry one another,”

You can {also} trade {freely} here,” or “You can settle/live {wherever you want} in the land. You can also do business buying and selling things {wherever you want},” Normally foreigners were not allowed to own land or to move around in the land to trade freely. So that is why Hamor is offering this in exchange for Jacob allowing his family to intermarry with the Hivites.

The term “gift” probably refers to additional gifts given to the bride and her family members (as in Gen 24:53). If the custom of paying a dowry is not known in your culture, you could include an explanation in a footnote. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

Also see how you translated “give...daughters...take...daughters...” in verse 9. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
GEN	34	16	kdg5		וְ⁠יָשַׁ֣בְנוּ אִתְּ⁠כֶ֔ם	1	And we will settle with you,	“We will {also} settle/live among you {in this land},” See how you translated “settle with” in verse 10.

If you have an inclusive form of this pronoun in your language, you could use it here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])

If that is confusing, you could say “our sister” instead. See how you translated “our {family’s} daughter” in verse 8.

They said,” or “and they told the elders/leaders of their city {about Jacob and his sons},” In that culture the leaders of a city held their meetings at the main city gates (as in Gen 23:3). Cities were surrounded by walls (that had gates) for protection. You could put some of that information in a footnote so that people understand what was happening.

GEN	34	25	qwap		וַ⁠יַּֽהַרְג֖וּ כָּל זָכָֽר	1	and killed every male.	“They killed all the males/men {there}”. The children who were males were probably not killed, since later (verse 29) it says that all the children were captured. Also, consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here that continues into verse 26.

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])
GEN	34	26	ixm7		וַ⁠יִּקְח֧וּ אֶת דִּינָ֛ה מִ⁠בֵּ֥ית שְׁכֶ֖ם	1	and they took Dinah from the house of Shechem	“Then they took/got/rescued Dinah from Shechem’s house”

All of Jacob’s sons probably joined Simeon and Levi in plundering the city, after those two had killed all the men there (verse 25).

Even though Shechem was the one who actually defiled Dinah (verses 2, 5, 7, 13), Jacob’s sons held everyone in the city responsible for the crime that their ruler’s son had committed (verses 25-29). If that is not clear, you could put that information in a footnote. Make sure that your translation of “they” does not refer to Jacob’s sons.

They also captured all their women and children.” or “They took away everything that was valuable, and also captured all the children and women. They seized and took away everything that was in the houses.” See how you translated “plundered” in verse 27.

Some languages have a similar idiom that fits well here. Do what is best in your language. Also see how you translated “the Canaanites” and “the Perizzites” in Gen 13:7; 15:20-21. There were other people groups also living in the land, but these two groups are the ones being emphasized here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	34	30	vadt	figs-synecdoche	וַ⁠אֲנִי֙ מְתֵ֣י מִסְפָּ֔ר	1	I am few of number,	“I/We {only} have a few men {to defend us},” or “I/We don’t have many people {in our family/household},” The words “I”, “me” and “my” refer in this verse to all of Jacob’s family; he uses these pronouns because he is the leader of his family. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
GEN	34	30	mx6s		וְ⁠נֶאֶסְפ֤וּ עָלַ⁠י֙ וְ⁠הִכּ֔וּ⁠נִי	1	and if they gather together against me and attack me,	“so if they {all} join {forces} against me/us and attack me/us,” Make sure your use of the pronouns “me” or “us” fits with the way you translate the rest of this sentence.
GEN	34	30	wwl3		וְ⁠נִשְׁמַדְתִּ֖י אֲנִ֥י וּ⁠בֵיתִֽ⁠י	1	then I will be destroyed, I and my house!”	“then I/we and my/our family/household will be destroyed/killed!” or “they will destroy/annihilate/kill me/us and {the rest of} my/our family/household!”

This rhetorical question shows Simeon and Levi’s anger and emphasizes that Shechem was wrong to do what he did and implies that he (and his city) deserved justice. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
GEN	34	31	dvoi		הַ⁠כְ⁠זוֹנָ֕ה	1	like a prostitute?”	“like/as a prostitute/whore!” or “like/as a {cheap,} immoral woman!”. Some languages have an idiom for this. Do what is best in your language.
GEN	35	1	lgpn	writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר אֱלֹהִים֙ אֶֽל יַעֲקֹ֔ב	1	Then God said to Jacob,	“Then God told/commanded Jacob,” Translate this quote margin in a way that is natural in your language and that fits with what God says. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])

GEN	35	1	sjly		עֲלֵ֥ה בֵֽית אֵ֖ל וְ⁠שֶׁב שָׁ֑ם	1	go up to Bethel and settle there,	“and travel to {the town of} Bethel and live there.” or “and move to {the town of} Bethel.” The verb “go up” reflects the fact that the town of Bethel is higher in elevation than the city of Shechem; it does not refer to the direction they were going, which was south. Many translations leave “up” implied (to prevent confusion). Do what is best in your language.
GEN	35	1	c6im	figs-explicit	וַ⁠עֲשֵׂה שָׁ֣ם מִזְבֵּ֔חַ	1	and make an altar there	“Build an altar there {and offer sacrifices on it}”. See how you translated “altar” in Gen 33:20. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	35	1	g64d	figs-explicit	לָ⁠אֵל֙	1	to the God	“to {me as} the God” or “to {me,} the God”. Make sure it is clear in your translation that God is referring to himself as he speaks here to Jacob. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	35	1	rohc		הַ⁠נִּרְאֶ֣ה אֵלֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1	who appeared to you	“who appeared/came to you {there}” or “who introduced himself/myself to you {there}”. See how you translated “appeared” in Gen 26:2, 24.
GEN	35	1	jucr		בְּ⁠בָרְחֲ⁠ךָ֔	1	when you were fleeing	“when you were running away”. See how you translated “flee” in Gen 31:20-21, 27.

GEN	35	2	p1wk		וְ⁠אֶ֖ל כָּל אֲשֶׁ֣ר עִמּ֑⁠וֹ	1	and to all who {were} with him,	“and everyone {else} who {was} with him,” This included Jacob’s servants and the people (women and children) whom his sons had just captured from the city of Shechem (Gen 34:29). You could put some of that information in a footnote.
GEN	35	2	xhj4	translate-key-terms	הָסִ֜רוּ אֶת אֱלֹהֵ֤י הַ⁠נֵּכָר֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר בְּ⁠תֹכְ⁠כֶ֔ם	1	“Remove the foreign gods that {are} among you,	“Get rid of the idols you have that other/pagan people/ethnic groups worship.” or “Give up the idols that you got/have from foreigners”. See how you translated “idols” and “gods” in Gen 31:19, 30, 32. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms]])
GEN	35	2	q5rp	translate-key-terms	וְ⁠הִֽטַּהֲר֔וּ	1	and purify yourselves	“and cleanse yourselves” or “Also wash and make yourselves clean”. They were to make themselves physically clean as a sign that they were preparing themselves mentally and spiritually to worship God (as their only God) at Bethel, which was a holy place where God had met with Jacob before. Some languages may have a special word for “purify” that communicates this. Do what is best in your language. Also consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin a new sentence here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms]])
GEN	35	2	jrdr		וְ⁠הַחֲלִ֖יפוּ שִׂמְלֹתֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	and change your clothes.	“and put/get on clean clothes.”
GEN	35	3	nw69		וְ⁠נָק֥וּמָה	1	Then let us get up	“Then we will/must pack up {our things/belongings}” or “Then we will/must leave here”. See how you translated “get up” in verse 1.
GEN	35	3	bq85		וְ⁠נַעֲלֶ֖ה בֵּֽית אֵ֑ל	1	and go up to Bethel,	“and go/move to {the town of} Bethel”. See how you translated “go up” in verse 1.
GEN	35	3	zrgb		וְ⁠אֶֽעֱשֶׂה שָּׁ֣ם מִזְבֵּ֗חַ לָ⁠אֵ֞ל	1	and there I will make an altar to God	“where I/we will build an altar to worship God” or “There I/we will build an altar and worship God”. The Hebrew text has “I” here, but probably also implies that others in Jacob’s household would help him build the altar. Consider whether or not it is best to begin a new sentence here in your language. Also see how you translated “make an altar” in verse 1.
GEN	35	3	nfro		הָ⁠עֹנֶ֤ה אֹתִ⁠י֙	1	who answered me	“because he answered/helped me” or “who answered/granted my prayers {for help}”
GEN	35	3	llzf	figs-idiom	בְּ⁠י֣וֹם צָֽרָתִ֔⁠י	1	in the day of my distress.	“during the days/time/times when I was in distress/trouble.” The phrase “In the day of” is used here as an idiom that could refer to the time when Jacob was fleeing from Esau, or it could be more general and also include other times when Jacob was suffering, such as the years he worked for Laban. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	35	3	kbut	figs-idiom	וַ⁠יְהִי֙ עִמָּדִ֔⁠י	1	And he has been with me	“He has {always} been/stayed with me/us {and taken care of me/us}”. See how you translated the idiom “with me” in Gen 31:5, where it also means that God is not only present with him but also helps him and takes care of him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	35	3	t1mm		בַּ⁠דֶּ֖רֶךְ אֲשֶׁ֥ר הָלָֽכְתִּי	1	in the way that I have gone.”	“everywhere that I/we have gone/traveled.”

See how you translated “foreign gods” in verse 2. You could translate this differently here since this is the second time they are mentioned in this paragraph.
GEN	35	4	m7l0		וְ⁠אֶת הַ⁠נְּזָמִ֖ים אֲשֶׁ֣ר בְּ⁠אָזְנֵי⁠הֶ֑ם	1	and the rings that {were} in their ears,	“and the earrings they wore on their ears.” or “and {all} their earrings.” These earrings seem to have been part of their idol worship and may have had images of their idols on them. You could include that information in a footnote.
GEN	35	4	zbt5		וַ⁠יִּטְמֹ֤ן אֹתָ⁠ם֙ יַעֲקֹ֔ב	1	and Jacob hid them	“Then Jacob hid/buried everything {in the ground}” or “Then Jacob hid/buried all those things {in the ground}”
GEN	35	4	udet		תַּ֥חַת	1	under	“beside” or “at the foot/base of”. Make sure it is clear in your translation that Jacob buried these things in the ground beside the tree, not directly under the trunk of the tree.
GEN	35	4	l10n	translate-unknown	הָ⁠אֵלָ֖ה	1	the terebinth tree	“the/a terebinth/oak tree”. Although this phrase refers to a terebinth tree, many translations have “oak tree” instead, or some other type of large, strong tree that is well known. See how you translated a different Hebrew word that is also translated “terebinth tree” or “oak tree” in Gen 12:6; 13:18; 14:13; 18:1. Another Hebrew word in Gen 35:8 is also translated as “oak”. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
GEN	35	4	ds2l		אֲשֶׁ֥ר עִם שְׁכֶֽם	1	that {was} by Shechem.	“that {was} near {the city of} Shechem.”

The Hebrew word “Elohim” probably means “God” in this phrase (as it usually does in the Bible); most English versions translate it that way here. Or it could be an adjective that modifies “dread/terror” and means “great/deep dread/terror” (similar to Gen 23:6, 30:8). See how you translated “dread” in Gen 9:2.
GEN	35	5	inln		וְ⁠לֹ֣א רָֽדְפ֔וּ אַחֲרֵ֖י	1	they did not pursue after	“they did not attack” or “no one attacked” or “none of them chased/came/went after”. Make sure your translation of “they” refers here to the people in the surrounding towns, not Jacob’s sons.
GEN	35	5	rb27	figs-metonymy	בְּנֵ֥י יַעֲקֹֽב	1	the sons of Jacob.	“Jacob’s sons/family {to avenge the people of Shechem}.” or “them.” or “Jacob and his family.” Jacob’s sons are mentioned here since they are in focus as the ones who just plundered the city of Shechem; Jacob and the rest of his family were there with his sons and were also in danger. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
GEN	35	6	djul		וַ⁠יָּבֹ֨א יַעֲקֹ֜ב ל֗וּזָ⁠ה	1	Then Jacob came to Luz,	“Then/Soon Jacob/they arrived at {the town of} Luz,” Be consistent in this verse with how you spelled “Luz” and “Bethel” in Gen 28:19.
GEN	35	6	o7jb		הִ֖וא בֵּֽית אֵ֑ל	1	which {is} Bethel,	“which {is also/now called/named} Bethel,” or “that {is}, Bethel,” or “which {also/now has the name} Bethel,” See how you translated “which is” in Gen 23:2, 19.
GEN	35	6	bsd8	figs-infostructure	אֲשֶׁר֙ בְּ⁠אֶ֣רֶץ כְּנַ֔עַן	1	which {is} in the land of Canaan,	“which is {also} in Canaan,” Since Shechem (verse 4) and Bethel were both in the land or region of Canaan, for some languages it is clearer or more natural to put this location phrase earlier in the verse and say, “Jacob/He and his family {continued traveling} in the land/region of Canaan and arrived at {the town of} Luz, which {also/now has the name} Bethel,” Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	35	6	bso7	figs-infostructure	ה֖וּא וְ⁠כָל הָ⁠עָ֥ם אֲשֶׁר עִמּֽ⁠וֹ	1	he and all the people who {were} with him.	“he/Jacob and his whole/entire household/family.” For some languages it is clearer or more natural to put this phrase near the beginning of this verse. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	35	7	g5tq	translate-key-terms	וַ⁠יִּ֤בֶן שָׁם֙ מִזְבֵּ֔חַ	1	And there he built an altar,	“There he/Jacob built an altar,” or “Then he/Jacob built an altar there,” Consider again how you translated “altar” throughout the book of Genesis. See Gen 8:20; 12:7-8; 13:4,18; 22:9; 26:25; 33:20; 35:1, 3, 7. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms]])
GEN	35	7	vjaz		וַ⁠יִּקְרָא֙ לַ⁠מָּק֔וֹם	1	and he called the place	“and he named the/that place” or “and he called/named it”
GEN	35	7	yknc	translate-names	אֵ֖ל בֵּֽית אֵ֑ל	1	El Bethel,	“El Bethel, {which means “the God of/at Bethel,”}” or “El Bethel, {which means “the God of/at God’s house,”}” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
GEN	35	7	atfy		כִּ֣י שָׁ֗ם	1	because there	“because that is where” or “because it was at Bethel that”
GEN	35	7	bssv		נִגְל֤וּ אֵלָי⁠ו֙ הָֽ⁠אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	God had revealed himself to him	“God had {first} introduced himself to him/Jacob” or “God had {first} appeared to him/Jacob”. Compare how you translated a different Hebrew word that has a similar meaning (“appeared”) in verses 1 and 9.
GEN	35	7	xgwv		בְּ⁠בָרְח֖⁠וֹ	1	when he was fleeing	“when/while he was running away”. See how you translated “fleeing” in verse 1.
GEN	35	7	wouc		מִ⁠פְּנֵ֥י אָחִֽי⁠ו	1	from the presence of his brother.	“from {the anger of} his brother.” or “from his brother.” See how you translated “from the presence of” in verse 1.
GEN	35	8	oazu		וַ⁠תָּ֤מָת דְּבֹרָה֙ מֵינֶ֣קֶת רִבְקָ֔ה	1	Then Deborah, the nurse of Rebekah, died	“Then {while they were still in Bethel,} Rebekah’s {former} nurse/nanny Deborah died” or “{While they were there,} Deborah died. She was the servant who had helped raise {Jacob’s mother} Rebekah {when she was young}.” See how you translated “nurse” in Gen 24:59.
GEN	35	8	b7u6		וַ⁠תִּקָּבֵ֛ר	1	and was buried	“and {her body} was buried {by Jacob} {in the ground}” or “They/Jacob buried her {body} {in the ground}”
GEN	35	8	yswx		מִ⁠תַּ֥חַת לְ⁠בֵֽית אֵ֖ל	1	below Bethel,	“{in the valley} below/near {the town of} Bethel,” or “{at a place} south of {the town of} Bethel,” The town of Bethel was built on a hill, so the phrase “below Bethel” means that Deborah was buried near Bethel, in a valley or place that was lower in elevation than the town, and possibly to the south of it.
GEN	35	8	w5x3	figs-infostructure	תַּ֣חַת הָֽ⁠אַלּ֑וֹן	1	under the oak tree.	“beside the/an oak tree” or “at the foot/base of an oak tree.” See how you translated a similar phrase (“under the terebinth/oak tree”) in verse 4. Many translations translate this phrase the same way in both places (“under an oak tree”), even though different Hebrew words are used for the type of tree. Also, for some languages it is more natural to put this phrase before the previous phrase and say, “at the base of an oak tree, below/near {the town of} Bethel.” Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	35	8	fzn2		וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֥א שְׁמ֖⁠וֹ	1	So he called its name	“So he/they named the tree/place” or “That is why the/that place is known as”. The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can: (1) be an idiom that means people in general call the tree or place Allon Bacuth. (2) literally refer to Jacob as the one who named the place. See how you translated a similar clause in Gen 31:38.
GEN	35	8	bku8	translate-names	אַלּ֥וֹן בָּכֽוּת	1	Allon Bacuth.	“Allon Bacuth, {which means “oak tree of weeping/mourning.”}” or “Allon Bacuth, {which means “oak tree where people mourn.”}” If you include the meaning of this name in your translation or in a footnote, make sure it fits with how you translated “oak tree” in the previous sentence. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
GEN	35	9	vtaz	figs-infostructure	וַ⁠יֵּרָ֨א אֱלֹהִ֤ים אֶֽל יַעֲקֹב֙ ע֔וֹד בְּ⁠בֹא֖⁠וֹ מִ⁠פַּדַּ֣ן אֲרָ֑ם	1	Then God appeared to Jacob again when he had come from Paddan Aram,	“Now that Jacob had returned from {the land/region of} Paddan Aram, God appeared to him {at Bethel} again” or “Now that Jacob had come/returned {to Bethel} from {the land/region of} Paddan Aram, God appeared to him {there} again” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	35	9	aayo	translate-key-terms	וַ⁠יְבָ֖רֶךְ אֹתֽ⁠וֹ	1	and he blessed him,	“and blessed him” or “and showed his goodness/kindness toward him” or “God blessed him”. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin a new sentence here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-key-terms]])
GEN	35	10	tdz0	writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּֽאמֶר ל֥⁠וֹ אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	and God said to him,	“and said to him,” or “by saying to him,” What God says to Jacob in verses 10-12 is the blessing. So make sure your translation of “blessed” (verse 9) and “said” (verse 10) refers to the same event, not two separate events. See how you translated “blessed...and said” in Gen 1:28. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	35	10	zjzr		שִׁמְ⁠ךָ֣ יַעֲקֹ֑ב	1	“Your name {is} Jacob,	“{Although} your name {has been} Jacob,” Make sure your translation of this clause does not sound like God was telling Jacob something he did not know.
GEN	35	10	m48m		לֹֽא יִקָּרֵא֩ שִׁמְ⁠ךָ֨ ע֜וֹד יַעֲקֹ֗ב	1	your name will not be called Jacob anymore,	“that will no longer be your name,” or “it will no longer be Jacob/that,” Notice that Jacob is referred to by both of his names in this chapter (“Jacob” in verses 11-20, 22-29; “Israel” in verses 10 and 21). You could put that information in a footnote. Also see how you translated this clause in Gen 32:28, and see the note about Jacob’s names there.
GEN	35	10	ww7d		כִּ֤י אִם יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ יִהְיֶ֣ה שְׁמֶ֔⁠ךָ	1	but Israel will be your name!”	“rather your name will be Israel!” or “but {rather} you will have the name Israel!”
GEN	35	10	ffk6	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֥א אֶת שְׁמ֖⁠וֹ יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	So he called his name Israel.	“So {once again} God gave Jacob the name Israel.” This was not the first time God had given Jacob the name Israel (see Gen 32:28). To make that clear, you could make “once again” explicit here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	35	11	okns	writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּאמֶר֩ ל֨⁠וֹ אֱלֹהִ֜ים	1	Then God said to him,	“Then God {also} said to him/Jacob,” or “Then God {also} {blessed him/Jacob by} saying,” or “God continued {blessing him/Jacob by} saying to him,” In verse 11, God continues the blessing that he started in verse 10, perhaps after a pause. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	35	11	z2k6		אֲנִ֨י אֵ֤ל שַׁדַּי֙	1	“I {am} God Almighty.	“I {am} Almighty God.” or “I {am} God {who is} all-powerful.” See how you translated the title “God Almighty” in Gen 17:1 and 28:3.
GEN	35	11	kua9		פְּרֵ֣ה	1	Be fruitful	“Have many children”. Consider again how you translated “Be fruitful and multiply” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 1:22, 28; 8:17; 9:1, 7; 35:11. It may be necessary to translate this phrase in different ways, depending on the context.
GEN	35	11	z3vs		וּ⁠רְבֵ֔ה	1	and multiply.	“and increase {in number}.” or “so that you {and your descendants} become {very} numerous/many.”
GEN	35	11	smh6		גּ֛וֹי וּ⁠קְהַ֥ל גּוֹיִ֖ם יִהְיֶ֣ה מִמֶּ֑⁠ךָּ	1	A nation and a community of nations will be from you,	“{Your descendants will become} a {large} people/ethnic group, in fact, many people/ethnic groups will come/descend from you,” or “Your descendants will become many people/ethnic groups,” Compare how you translated a similar phrase (“a multitude of nations”) in Gen 17:4-5 and another similar phrase (“a community of peoples”) in Gen 28:3.

But while they were still a distance away from there,” or “and headed for {the town of} Ephrath. While they were still some distance from there,” The phrase “a distance of land” is very general, but your translation should not make it sound like the distance was too far, because Rachel’s grave is about two kilometers (one mile) from Ephrath (Bethlehem).

In the Hebrew text this name is two words connected with a dash (“Ben-oni”). Many translations write it that way, or as one word (“Benoni”), and a few translations write it as “Ben Oni”. Any of these spellings is fine. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

It may be necessary to translate this word in slightly different ways, depending on the context.

Only the first two wives mentioned in this chapter were Canaanites; see the comment about Basemath at verse 3. The Canaanites were the descendants of Noah’s grandson Canaan (Ham’s son) and included the Hittites and Hivites (verse 2; Genesis 10:15-18) and several other people groups.

She was also known as Mahalath (Gen 28:9); you could include some of that information in a footnote.

Use a kinship term here in your language that fits with those facts. See how you translated “the sister of Nebaioth” in Gen 28:9. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])

Most translations follow the Hebrew text and have “Hadar” here. Some translations (and ancient versions such as SP, LXX, Syriac and Vulgate) have “Hadad” here instead, in order to spell this name the same way it is spelled in 1 Chronicles 1:50-51. However, that could cause confusion because “Hadad” is also the name of a different king in verses 35-36 above. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])

(1) Most translations treat all the names in verses 40-43 as the names of chiefs (as in the ULT and UST of these verses). (2) However, some scholars think that all the names in verses 40-43 are the names of regions or clans. Alternate translation of verses 40-43: “{These were} {the names of} the clans/tribes {that descended} from Esau. Each clan/tribe lived {in the land of Edom} in its own region that was named after that clan/tribe. {The names of the clans/tribes} were TImna, Alvan,...Iram.

GEN	37	1	o1d7		וַ⁠יֵּ֣שֶׁב יַעֲקֹ֔ב	1	And Jacob lived	“Now Jacob was {still} living” or “Jacob continued to live”. Chapter 37 continues the history about Jacob that left off at the end of chapter 35. Begin this chapter in a way that is natural in your language. Make sure the way you translate “lived” allows for the fact that Jacob was already living in Canaan and had settled near the city of Hebron, where his father and grandfather had lived previously (Gen 35:27).

See Gen 2:4; 6:9; 11:27; 25:19; 36:1; 37:2, where what follows is a narrative or history of events. Compare that to Gen 5:1; 10:1; 11:10; 25:12; 36:9, where what follows is more of a genealogy (list of names). It may be necessary to translate this phrase in different ways, depending on the context.

Also, make sure your translation of “their father” does not sound like the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah had a different father than Joseph had. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

This verse introduces background information for the events that happen next. Consider what is the best way to begin this sentence in your language. Make sure it is clear in your translation or in a footnote that Jacob (verse 1) and Israel (verse 3) refer to the same person, not two separate people. For a note about this, see Gen 35:10.

Many translations (including the Greek Septuagint and Latin Vulgate) say that the tunic or robe was “multicolored” or “colorful”. This “tunic” was probably full-length to the ankles and had long sleeves that reached to the hands. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

In this context “found” means the man happened to meet Joseph as Joseph was walking around looking for his brothers; the man was not intentionally looking for him.

GEN	37	25	czij		וּ⁠גְמַלֵּי⁠הֶ֣ם נֹֽשְׂאִ֗ים	1	And their camels were carrying	“Their camels were loaded with”. Consider again how you translated “camel” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 12:16 (and note); 24:10-11, 14, 19-20, 22, 25, 30-32, 35, 44, 46, 61, 63-64; 30:43; 31:17, 18, 34; 32:7, 15; 37:25.
GEN	37	25	z9ez	translate-unknowns	נְכֹאת֙ וּ⁠צְרִ֣י וָ⁠לֹ֔ט	1	spices and balm and myrrh	“{expensive} spices, healing resin/salve and incense”. Gilead was a mountainous region east of the Jordan River that was famous as a source of balm (or balsam), which was a rare tree resin that was used for perfume and for medicine. Myrrh was another type of tree resin that was used as incense and as medicine. You could put some of that information in a footnote. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknowns]])

GEN	37	26	bpxq	figs-rquestion	מַה בֶּ֗צַע	1	“What gain {is there}	“What will we gain” or “We will not gain anything”. Judah uses a rhetorical question here to emphasize his point. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

Also, the phrase “his blood” is an idiom that refers to Joseph’s death. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	37	27	x9q0		לְכ֞וּ וְ⁠נִמְכְּרֶ֣⁠נּוּ	1	Come and	“{Instead,} come on,” See how you translated “come and” in verse 20.

See how you translated a similar idiom (“my bone and my flesh”) in Gen 29:14. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	37	27	feeb		וַֽ⁠יִּשְׁמְע֖וּ אֶחָֽי⁠ו	1	And his brothers listened.	“Judah’s brothers agreed {with him}.” or “Judah’s brothers agreed {to do what Judah had proposed/suggested}.” See how you translated “listened” in Gen 34:24.

However sometimes (as here) the names of those people groups are used interchangeably for the same people (also see Judges 8:22, 24, 26). Perhaps that was because the two people groups had intermarried. Or there may have been merchants from the two people groups in this caravan who bought and sold Joseph together. You could put some of that information in a footnote.
GEN	37	28	hyo6	figs-explicit	וַֽ⁠יִּמְשְׁכוּ֙ וַ⁠יַּֽעֲל֤וּ אֶת יוֹסֵף֙ מִן הַ⁠בּ֔וֹר	1	they drew Joseph up and lifted him out of the cistern	“{some of} Joseph’s brothers pulled Joseph/him up out of the pit/well”. Not all of Joseph’s brothers were there, because we know from the next verse that at least Reuben was somewhere else when they sold Joseph. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Twenty shekels of silver was equal to about one-fourth of a kilo (half a pound) and was the average price for a slave. You could put some of that information in a footnote. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])

GEN	37	30	vtrt		הַ⁠יֶּ֣לֶד	1	“The boy	“The lad/youth” or “Joseph” or “Our {younger} brother”. Joseph was seventeen years old (verse 2), so this phrase should be translated in a way that is appropriate for his older brother to refer to him here. See how you translated a different word that has a similar meaning in Gen 21:12.
GEN	37	30	ejje		אֵינֶ֔⁠נּוּ	1	is not {there}!	“is gone/missing!”
GEN	37	30	fot5	figs-rquestion	וַ⁠אֲנִ֖י אָ֥נָה אֲנִי בָֽא	1	And I, where am I going?”	“Now what should/can I do?” or “Now I do not know what to do!” Reuben uses a rhetorical question here to express how distressed he is and to emphasize that he does not know what to do. Do what is natural in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

GEN	37	32	wvho		זֹ֣את מָצָ֑אנוּ הַכֶּר נָ֗א	1	“We found this. Please examine	“We found this {tunic/robe}. Please look at it {to see/determine}”. See how you translated “examine” in Gen 31:32.

If this custom is not familiar in your culture, you could put that information in a footnote. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

You could put that information in a footnote. Your translation of “Sheol” should not refer to hell or a place of punishment. Some translations have “the grave” here, but that leaves out the idea of an afterlife that this sentence implies. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

The word “Adullamite” refers to the fact that Hirah was from the town of Adullam; it is not the name of a people group. The town of Adullam was about 19 kilometers (12 miles) northwest of the city of Hebron (37:14), and was lower in elevation, which is why the text says that Judah “went down” to get there.

See Gen 4:1 (and note), 17, 25; 19:8; 24:16; 38:26. It may be necessary to translate 38:26 differently, since the relationship in this verse was outside of marriage.

Potiphar {was} {one of} Pharaoh’s officials/officers, the captain over the king’s {personal} guards.” Do what is best in your language. See how you translated “Ishmaelites” in Gen 37:25, 27-28.

In verses 2 through 20, Potiphar is referred to as Joseph’s master (verses 2-3, 7-8, 16, 19-20) and “the Egyptian” (verse 5); he is no longer mentioned by his name in the Hebrew text. Some translations continue to use Potiphar’s name occasionally in verses 2 through 20 to prevent confusion and make it clear that all of these references refer to the same person, not two or three different people. Do what is best in your language. See how you translated “master” or “owner” in Gen 24:9-10.

As Joseph’s master, Potiphar still had more authority than Joseph. But he had given Joseph authority to act in his place over everything in his household. Try to make that clear in your translation. Also consider whether it is more natural in your language to begin verse 9 with a new sentence, or to continue the sentence from verse 8.

The phrase “Then/And it happened” is used several times in this chapter (verses 5, 7, 10, 11, 13, 15, 18, 19) to introduce and emphasize important events and to increase suspense so that the audience wonders what the outcome will be.

Potiphar probably had soldiers arrest Joseph for him, since he had the authority to do that as the captain of the guards. Consider again how you referred to Joseph and Joseph’s master Potiphar in verses 1-20. As usual, after you finish translating a section like this, it is a good practice to read the section aloud at a normal pace and listen carefully to make sure you refer to everyone accurately and naturally at each point in the text.

The chief cupbearer was one of Pharaoh’s most trusted servants. He was in charge of serving Pharaoh anything that he wanted to drink, especially wine. It was his job to test the drink before Pharaoh had some, to make sure it was high quality and not poisoned. Some of that information could be put in a footnote. Also, it may be more natural to include here in verse 1 the fact that these were the head officials in these jobs, rather than wait until verse 2 to introduce that. Do what is best in your language.

Often in the Bible (as here), when it says that a king (or someone else with authority) did something, it is implied that he had people who were under his authority actually do it. See how you translated a similar clause in Gen 39:20. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Or you could put this sentence earlier in this verse and say, “Then one night, the king of Egypt’s wine server and baker each had a dream while they were in prison, and each {man’s/one’s} dream had its own interpretation/meaning.” Make sure it is clear in your translation that the cupbearer and baker in verse 5 are the same officials as those in verses 2-4.

Here, the phrase “lift up your head from on you” seems to have a literal meaning (of having the baker beheaded) in contrast to the figurative meaning of “lift up your head” in verse 13 (where it means to summon from a lowly or shameful place). Make sure your translation of this phrase is accurate and clear in both contexts.

Since Joseph lived in Egypt and Egyptian men kept their heads and faces clean-shaven, Joseph probably also shaved his head and his face.

GEN	41	27	yp8x		יִהְי֕וּ שֶׁ֖בַע שְׁנֵ֥י רָעָֽב	1	There will be seven years of famine.	“{They both mean that} there will be a famine that lasts seven years.” or “{Both dreams mean that} there will be seven years when food will be very/extremely scarce.” A “famine” is a prolonged period of time when people are starving because crops are failing, often due to a lack of rain or other severe weather conditions. See how you translated this term in Gen 12:10 and 26:1.

GEN	41	38	ivpt		אֲשֶׁ֛ר ר֥וּחַ אֱלֹהִ֖ים בּֽ⁠וֹ	1	who {has} the Spirit of God in him?”	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean (1) “who has God’s Spirit in him” or “whom God’s Spirit guides” (2) “who has a divine spirit in him” or “who has a spirit of {the} gods in him”. Most translations follow the first interpretation, since Joseph had just talked to Pharaoh about God (verses 16, 28, 32) and Pharaoh acknowledges God in verse 39.
GEN	41	39	o0ve		וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר פַּרְעֹה֙ אֶל יוֹסֵ֔ף	1	Then Pharaoh said to Joseph,	“Then he said to Joseph,” or “Then Pharaoh/he {turned} to Joseph and said,”

The signet ring was the identification ring that the king used to seal official documents. See how you translated “signet” in Gen 38:18. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
GEN	41	42	f6us	translate-symaction	וַ⁠יִּתֵּ֥ן אֹתָ֖⁠הּ עַל יַ֣ד יוֹסֵ֑ף	1	and put it on Joseph’s hand.	“and put it on Joseph’s finger {to show that he had appointed him}.” or “and placed it on Joseph’s finger {showing he now had Pharaoh’s authority}”. The signet ring showed that Joseph represented Pharaoh and had his complete authority. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

The Hebrew word for “fine linen” refers to a special kind of white cloth that was woven out of flax and had a fine texture. Clothes made from linen were expensive and were worn by the king and high officials. If linen is not known in your language area, you could be more general and refer to expensive, high-quality clothes. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])

It was used as transportation and was especially used in battles. Translate this in a way that fits with this description. It may be helpful to include a picture of a chariot in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

Rather they were calling out loudly enough for people to hear them.
GEN	41	43	nue4	translate-symaction	אַבְרֵ֑ךְ	1	“Bow down!”	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. 1. It could be a transliteration of an Egyptian word that means, “Bow down {in reverence/respect}!” or “Make way {for the king’s appointed one}!” or “Welcome/Honor {your new leader}!”, which is what people would be told to do to honor an important person; 2. It could be a combination of Hebrew words that means, “{This is} {the} father of {the} king!” which is similar to what Joseph says in Gen 45:8. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
GEN	41	43	ojwo		וְ⁠נָת֣וֹן אֹת֔⁠וֹ עַ֖ל	1	So he put him over	“So Pharaoh put Joseph in charge of” or “In that way, Pharaoh {officially} appointed/installed Joseph to be {the manager/supervisor} over/of”. See how you translated a similar sentence in verse 41.

See how you translated “priest” in Gen 14:18.

GEN	42	26	evqc		וַ⁠יֵּלְכ֖וּ מִ⁠שָּֽׁם	1	and went from there.	“and left there {to go home}.” or “and started traveling {home}.” The way you translate this phrase should reflect the fact that Joseph’s brothers were just starting their journey back home; they did not reach their home until several days later (verse 29).

Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	42	37	r1vg	figs-idiom	תְּנָ֤⁠ה אֹת⁠וֹ֙ עַל יָדִ֔⁠י	1	Put him in my hand,	“Entrust him/Benjamin to my care {as we travel to Egypt},” or “Let me be responsible for {taking care of} him/Benjamin {on our trip to Egypt},” The phrase “in my hand” is used here as an idiom that means that Reuben was going to be responsible for Benjamin’s welfare. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])

Notice that the pronoun “you” is plural in this verse. Also, see how you translated “go down” in verse 2.
GEN	42	38	tijy	translate-kinship	כִּֽי אָחִ֨י⁠ו מֵ֜ת	1	because his brother is dead	“His brother is dead,” Joseph was Benjamin’s older brother from the same father and mother. Consider whether your language has a special kinship term for that. Also consider whether or not it is better to begin a new sentence here in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])
GEN	42	38	fkjb		וְ⁠ה֧וּא לְ⁠בַדּ֣⁠וֹ נִשְׁאָ֗ר	1	and he alone is left.	“so he is the only one {of his mother’s sons} {who is} still alive.” or “and/so he is the only one/son {I have} left {from his mother}.” You could include a footnote here that explains that Joseph and Benjamin were the only two sons of Rachel, Jacob’s favorite wife who died after giving birth to Benjamin (Gen 35:16-20).
GEN	42	38	lfo5	figs-hypo	וּ⁠קְרָאָ֤⁠הוּ אָסוֹן֙ בַּ⁠דֶּ֨רֶךְ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר תֵּֽלְכוּ בָ֔⁠הּ	1	And {if} harm were to meet him on the road that you are going on,	“And/So if he were to be harmed/killed during your journey,” or “So if anything bad happened to him while you are traveling,” Jacob is saying what would happen if he lost Benjamin too. Consider how to best translate this hypothetical statement in your language. Also, see how you translated “harm...meet him” in verse 4. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])
GEN	42	38	el1w	figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠הוֹרַדְתֶּ֧ם אֶת שֵׂיבָתִ֛⁠י בְּ⁠יָג֖וֹן	1	then you would bring my gray head down in sorrow	“you would cause me, your gray-haired/elderly father, to grieve so deeply/badly that I would {die and} go down” or “you would cause me, your gray-haired/elderly father, so much sorrow/grief that I would {die and} go down”. The phrase “my gray head” is a synecdoche which Jacob uses to refer to himself as their aged father. Consider whether your language has a similar phrase that is natural and works well here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])
GEN	42	38	gbtu	translate-unknown	שְׁאֽוֹלָ⁠ה	1	to Sheol!”	“to the afterworld!” The Hebrew term “Sheol” is the name of the place where the spirits of people went after they died. If you transliterate the name “Sheol” in your translation, you could put its meaning in a footnote. See how you translated this term in Gen 37:35, and see the note about that there. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
GEN	43	1	fl29	grammar-connect-time-background	וְ⁠הָ⁠רָעָ֖ב	1	Now the famine	“The famine” or “The food shortage”. The setting changes here to focus on what is happening in Canaan. Some languages use a special conjunction (like “Now”) to indicate that, while others do not use a conjunction here. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background]])
GEN	43	1	zxpk	figs-idiom	כָּבֵ֥ד	1	{was} heavy	“{was} oppressive/severe” or “{continued to be} severe”. The word “heavy” is used here as an idiom that means the famine caused everyone much suffering. See how you translated the same idiom in Gen 12:10 and Gen 41:31. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	43	1	muwl		בָּ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	in the land.	“in the land/region {of Canaan}.”
GEN	43	2	pani		וַ⁠יְהִ֗י	1	So it happened	“So it happened {that}” or “So”. This phrase introduces an important event and helps create suspense so that readers will wonder what the outcome will be. Many translations omit “it happened” because it is not natural in their language. Do what is best in your language.
GEN	43	2	jggb	writing-pronouns	כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֤ר כִּלּוּ֙	1	when they	“when Jacob and his family”. Consider whether it is clearer in your language to use a pronoun or a noun phrase here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

GEN	43	3	hv8s		הָ⁠אִ֤ישׁ	1	“The man	“The man {who governs/controls the country there}” or “The governor {there}”. The brothers did not realize yet that Joseph was the governor they had spoken to in Egypt, so Judah referred to him generally here as “the man”. See how you translated a similar phrase in Gen 42:30.
GEN	43	3	gegs		הָעֵ֣ד הֵעִד֩ בָּ֨⁠נוּ לֵ⁠אמֹר֙	1	strongly warned us, saying,	“sternly warned/told us” or “was serious when he warned us”

GEN	43	6	wdbq	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר֙ יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל	1	Then Israel	“Then {their father} Israel”. If it is not clear that “Israel” (verse 6) and “their father” (verse 2) refer to the same person, you could include “their father” here in your translation or in a footnote. See what you did for a similar case in Gen 42:5. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	43	6	i3eu	writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר֙	1	said,	“asked {them},” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])

Jacob uses a rhetorical question here to scold his sons and to show how upset he is. Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
GEN	43	6	b9q9		לָ⁠אִ֔ישׁ	1	the man	“that man” or “the/that governor”. See how you translated “the man” in verses 3 and 5.
GEN	43	6	euqg		הַ⁠ע֥וֹד לָ⁠כֶ֖ם אָֽח	1	you have yet {another} brother?”	“that you have another brother!” or “that you have a younger brother?” If you translate this rhetorical question as a statement, make sure that you end it with a period or exclamation mark.

He {is} still alive.”	“{Yes sir,} our father, who highly respects you, is still alive and well/blessed.” The brothers refer to their father as “your servant” here to show respect to Joseph and to acknowledge his high position. Translate this phrase in a polite way that shows respect toward Joseph. Also, the pronoun “our” is exclusive here because Joseph’s brothers did not yet know that they were talking to Joseph. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-honorifics]])
GEN	43	28	xxy3		וַֽ⁠יִּקְּד֖וּ	1	Then they bowed	“Then they bowed {their heads}” or “Then they knelt”. In this verse, the terms “bowed” and “bowed down” translate two different Hebrew words that together describe and emphasize the process of bowing down to the ground.
GEN	43	28	corb	translate-symaction	וַיִּֽשְׁתַּחֲוּֽוּ	1	and bowed down.	“and bowed down {to the ground} {again}.” or “and prostrated themselves {in front of him} {again}.” See how you translated “bowed down” in verse 26. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

This question could be an actual question or a rhetorical question. The fact that Joseph does not wait for an answer suggests that this is a rhetorical question, especially since he already realized that the new brother in the group was Benjamin (verse 16). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
GEN	43	29	kc74		אֲשֶׁ֥ר אֲמַרְתֶּ֖ם אֵלָ֑⁠י	1	whom you spoke to me {about}?”	“whom you told me about.” Make sure that your punctuation here fits with the way you translated this sentence, either as a question or a statement.

GEN	43	29	quwl		בְּנִֽ⁠י	1	my son.”	“young man.” The phrase “my son” is a kind way to address a man who is younger or of lower status; it does not mean that Benjamin was Joseph’s actual son.

Decide whether you want to make that information explicit in your translation or include it in a footnote. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

Here, it probably means that they had drunk enough wine that they were feeling happy and sociable.

GEN	44	5	xywy		וְ⁠ה֕וּא נַחֵ֥שׁ יְנַחֵ֖שׁ בּ֑⁠וֹ	1	and what he indeed divines with?	“{It is} the one he regularly uses for divination!” or “He {also} uses it to find out secret things!” The word “divines” refers to the practice of interpreting omens (signs) or using supernatural means to find out things. See how you translated a similar term (“divination”) in Gen 30:27. Also consider whether or not it is better in your language to begin a new sentence here.
GEN	44	5	k23v		הֲרֵעֹתֶ֖ם אֲשֶׁ֥ר עֲשִׂיתֶֽם	1	You have done evil {in} what you have done!’ ”	“What you have done is very evil/wrong!” The phrase “you have done” is repeated in this sentence for emphasis. Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language.

GEN	44	29	j8sw	translate-unknown	שְׁאֹֽלָ⁠ה	1	to Sheol.’	“to the afterworld.” Sheol is the Hebrew name for the world of the dead, that is, the place where the spirits of all people go after they die. You could put that information in a footnote. Your translation of “Sheol” should not refer to hell or a place of punishment. Some translations have “the grave” here, but that leaves out the idea of an afterlife that this sentence implies. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown]])
GEN	44	30	i3nm		וְ⁠עַתָּ֗ה	1	“And now,	“So now/then,” This phrase introduces the conclusion to what Judah said in verses 24-29. Consider the best way to do that in your language.

Many translations omit the phrase because it is not natural in their language. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hypo]])

See how you translated “bring...gray head down in sorrow to Sheol” in Gen 42:38, and a similar phrase in 44:29.
GEN	44	31	ri7u		שְׁאֹֽלָ⁠ה	1	to Sheol!	“to the afterworld!” Consider again how you translated “Sheol” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 37:35; 42:38; 44:29, 31.

Throughout this chapter, the same Hebrew word is translated as “slave” when the context has negative connotations (verses 9-10, 16-17, 33), but is translated as “servant” when the context has more positive connotations (verses 7, 9, 16, 18-19, 21, 23-24, 27, 30-32). Do what is best in your language in each context.

GEN	44	34	n1n7		אֶֽעֱלֶ֣ה אֶל אָבִ֔⁠י	1	go up to my father	“go back to my father” or “return {home} to my father”. Consider again how you translated “...up” in verses 17, 24, 33-34.

Make sure your translation of this phrase does not sound angry or critical. Also see how you translated “vision” in Gen 15:1.
GEN	46	2	l2np	figs-infostructure	וַ⁠יֹּ֖אמֶר	1	And he said,	“Israel/Jacob replied {to him},” For some languages, it is more natural to put this quotation margin (“he said”) after the quote. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])

In chapters 45 and 46, the text repeatedly switches back and forth between both of Jacob’s names. Make sure it is clear in your translation that these two names refer to the same person.

For some languages it is better to make that explicit here, rather than wait until the end of the verse. Do what is best in your language.

Translate this in a polite way that shows respect toward Pharaoh. Also, see how you translated “livestock men” in verse 32. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

He gave them the choicest property {in Egypt}, which was in {Goshen Province, also known as} Rameses Province.” It is implied that Rameses (verse 11) was another name for Goshen (verses 1, 4, 6). If necessary, you could make that information explicit in your translation or put it in a footnote. Later in Egypt’s history, some of the Pharaohs were named Rameses and a city was named after one of them (Exodus 1:11). (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
GEN	47	13	bhmg		בְּ⁠כָל הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	in all the earth,	This phrase is ambiguous in the Hebrew text.

GEN	47	13	f4np		וַ⁠תֵּ֜לַהּ	1	were languishing	“were fainting/weak” or “were suffering badly/terribly” or “were wasting away”. The verb “languishing” refers in general to the suffering that the famine was causing, including things such as weakness, fainting and other distress.

Consider again how you translated “silver” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 13:2; 20:16 (and note) ; 23:15,16; 24:35, 53; 31:15; 37:28; 42:25, 27-28, 35; 43:12, 15, 18, 21-23; 44:1, 2, 8 ; 45:22; 47:14, 15, 16, 18.

It is different from the word for “land” in the rest of this chapter (in verses 1, 4, 6, 11, 13-15, 27-28).

The Samaritan Pentateuch (a different Hebrew version) and the Septuagint (Greek translation of the Hebrew text) have “made the people slaves” instead, which may refer to the fact that all the people would now be working for Pharaoh since all the fields belonged to him.

Also, consider again how you translated “land/farmland” in verses 18-26.
GEN	47	27	pgii	grammar-connect-time-background	וַ⁠יֵּ֧שֶׁב	1	And	“So/Now” or “Meanwhile”. It was already mentioned in verse 11 that Israel (Jacob) had settled in the country of Egypt.

GEN	47	27	hmo4	figs-explicit	יִשְׂרָאֵ֛ל	1	Israel	“{Jacob, whose other name was} Israel,” or “Israel {that is, Jacob,}” The name “Israel” and the name “Jacob” refer to the same person.

GEN	47	29	r7vu		אַל נָ֥א תִקְבְּרֵ֖⁠נִי	1	Please do not bury me	“Please {promise that you will} not bury my body/bones”. Make sure your translation of “bury me” does not sound like Israel would still be alive when he was buried.

See how you translated an idiom with a similar meaning in Gen 15:15. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])
GEN	47	30	sgkn		וּ⁠נְשָׂאתַ֨⁠נִי֙ מִ⁠מִּצְרַ֔יִם	1	then carry me out of Egypt	“carry/take my body out of Egypt {to the region of Canaan}”. See how you translated “me” in verse 29.

Abraham, Isaac and Rebekah were also buried there (Gen 23:19-20; 25:9-10; 49:31). You could put some of that information in a footnote. Also see how you translated “grave” in Gen 35:20 and a different word with a similar meaning (“burial place”) in Gen 23:4, 6, 9, 20.
GEN	47	30	ze0a	writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּאמַ֕ר	1	And he	“Then Joseph” or “Joseph”. Make sure it is clear in your translation that Joseph is the one speaking here.

GEN	47	31	et9n		עַל רֹ֥אשׁ הַ⁠מִּטָּֽה	1	at the head of the bed.	“{as he sat} at the head/top of {his} bed.” or “{as he was sitting/lying} on {his} bed.” The Hebrew text has “at the head of the bed” here, while the Septuagint (Greek translation of the Old Testament) has “on the top of his staff” instead, which is quoted in Hebrews 11:21. You could include some of that information in a footnote. The difference between versions may be due to the fact that the Hebrew words for “bed” and “staff” are very similar in spelling. Or it could be that Jacob did both; for example, he may have been sitting at the head of his bed and leaning on his staff when he bowed his head and worshiped God.

GEN	48	2	lvjv		וַ⁠יִּתְחַזֵּק֙ יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל	1	Then Israel	“Then Israel” or “{Immediately} Israel{, who was lying down,}” Make sure it is clear in your translation or in a footnote that “Israel” (verses 2, 8, 11, 13-14, 21) and “Jacob” (verses 2-3) refer to the same person, not two different people.
GEN	48	2	oru5	figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּתְחַזֵּק֙	1	gathered his strength	“rallied/mustered his strength” or “used all his strength” or “exerted himself”. Consider whether you language has a similar idiom that fits well here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	48	2	iv8t	figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֵּ֖שֶׁב עַל הַ⁠מִּטָּֽה	1	and sat up on the bed.	“and sat up on/at {the edge/head of} {his} bed {and they greeted each other}.” The context (verse 12) shows that Jacob sat on the edge of his bed with his feet resting on the floor and his knees facing Joseph’s sons. Also, for some languages it may be necessary (for politeness) to make it explicit that they greeted each other first before continuing their conversation. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	48	3	ctdz	writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר יַעֲקֹב֙ אֶל יוֹסֵ֔ף	1	Then Jacob said to Joseph,	“Then Jacob recounted/related to Joseph {the following}:” or “Then Jacob told Joseph,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	48	3	avig		אֵ֥ל שַׁדַּ֛י	1	“God Almighty	“Almighty/All-powerful God” or “God {who is} all-powerful”. See how you translated this title in Gen 43:14.
GEN	48	3	nhrh		נִרְאָֽה אֵלַ֥⁠י	1	appeared to me	“appeared to me {long ago}” or “came to me in a vision {long ago}”. Consider again how you translated “appear” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 8:5; 12:7; 17:1; 18:1; 26:2, 24; 35:1, 9; 46:29; 48:3. It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.
GEN	48	3	ejuo	figs-infostructure	בְּ⁠ל֖וּז בְּ⁠אֶ֣רֶץ כְּנָ֑עַן	1	at Luz in the land of Canaan,	“{when I was} at {the town of} Luz in the land/region of Canaan,” or “in the land/region of Canaan at {the town of} Luz,” For some languages it is more natural to put the larger place (Canaan) first before the smaller place (Luz) that is located inside it. It may also be more natural to put the time and place phrases first in this verse and say, “{Long ago} {when I was} at {the town of} Luz in the land/region of Canaan, God Almighty....” Do what is best in your language. Also see how you spelled the name “Luz” in Gen 28:19 and 35:6. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure]])
GEN	48	3	fny4		וַ⁠יְבָ֖רֶךְ אֹתִֽ⁠י	1	and he blessed me	“He blessed me {there}” or “He pronounced a blessing over me {there}”. For some languages it is more natural to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language.
GEN	48	4	eckb		וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֵלַ֗⁠י	1	and said to me,	“by saying to me,” or “He said,” Make sure your translation of “blessed...and said” (verses 3-4) refers to the same event, not two separate events.

See how you translated “make you fruitful and multiply you” in Gen 28:3 and “make him fruitful and...multiply him” in Gen 17:20.
GEN	48	4	hk2s		לִ⁠קְהַ֣ל עַמִּ֑ים	1	a community of peoples.	“many people/ethnic groups.” See how you translated this phrase in Gen 28:3, and a similar phrase (“a community of nations”) in 35:11.

The phrase “And now” shows that there is a change of topic. Make sure it is clear in your translation that Jacob is no longer quoting God’s words in verse 5. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])
GEN	48	5	etnc		הַ⁠נּוֹלָדִ֨ים לְ⁠ךָ֜	1	who were born for you	“who were born to you” or “who were born”

GEN	48	7	wl21	figs-explicit	וַ⁠אֲנִ֣י	1	And I,	“I {want it this way because}” or “I {am doing this because}”. Jacob is probably explaining in verse 7 that since his favorite wife Rachel died with only two sons, that is why he is treating her son Joseph’s two sons as his sons (verses 5-6). You could make some of that information explicit in your translation or include it in a footnote. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	48	7	ysj7	figs-explicit	בְּ⁠בֹאִ֣⁠י	1	as I was coming	“as I {and our family} were coming/returning {home}” or “as our family was coming/returning {home}”. Jacob is in focus here, but he was traveling with his family, not alone. Decide whether or not it is necessary to make that explicit in your translation. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
GEN	48	7	wtbj		מִ⁠פַּדָּ֗ן	1	from Paddan,	“from {the land/region of} Paddan {Aram},” Consider again how you translated “{the land/region of} Paddan Aram” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 25:20 (and note); 28:2, 5-7; 31:18; 33:18; 35:9, 26; 46:15; 48:7. Also, be consistent with how you spelled “Aram” in those verses and in Gen 10:22-23; 22:21; 24:10.
GEN	48	7	o7ue		רָחֵ֜ל	1	Rachel	“{your mother} Rachel” or “{my beloved wife} Rachel”
GEN	48	7	sthz		מֵ֩תָה֩ עָלַ֨⁠י	1	died beside me	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here because the preposition can have different meanings. It can mean (1) “died beside me” or “died by my side” (2) “died, {bringing sorrow/grief} on/to me”

GEN	48	7	oba3		וָ⁠אֶקְבְּרֶ֤⁠הָ שָּׁם֙ בְּ⁠דֶ֣רֶךְ אֶפְרָ֔ת	1	And I buried her there beside the road of Ephrath,	“{As you know,} I buried her body there by the road that goes to Ephrath,”
GEN	48	7	la6n		הִ֖וא בֵּ֥ית לָֽחֶם	1	which {is} Bethlehem.”	“which {now has the name} Bethlehem.” The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. This phrase might be (1) Jacob’s words (2) the author’s words. If you follow the second interpretation, you could put this phrase within parentheses, outside of the quote marks.
GEN	48	8	r9vd		וַ⁠יַּ֥רְא יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל אֶת בְּנֵ֣י יוֹסֵ֑ף	1	Then Israel saw the sons of Joseph	“Then Israel saw/noticed Joseph’s {two} sons”

GEN	48	8	l41u		מִי אֵֽלֶּה	1	“Who {are} these?”	“Who {are} these {young men}?” or “Whose {sons} {are} these?” Joseph’s two sons were in their 20s at this time, so refer to them here with a term that fits with that fact. They were born before the famine started (Gen 41:50-52), and Jacob had now been in Egypt for 17 years (47:28).
GEN	48	9	ddqw		וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר יוֹסֵף֙ אֶל אָבִ֔י⁠ו	1	And Joseph said to his father,	“Joseph said/replied to him,” or “Joseph replied/answered,”

GEN	48	9	e66c	writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּאמַ֕ר	1	Then he said,	“Then Israel said {to Joseph/him},” Make sure it is clear in your translation who is speaking here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	48	9	kqtd	figs-youdual	קָֽחֶ⁠ם נָ֥א אֵלַ֖⁠י	1	“Please bring them to me,	“Please bring them {closer} to me”. Some languages have a dual pronoun that works well to refer to Joseph’s two sons here (and throughout chapter 48). Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual]])

Consider whether or not it is natural in your language to use a conjunction (“Now”) to begin this clause that gives background information about Israel. Also, the word “heavy” is used here as an idiom that means Israel’s eyesight was getting bad, but he could still see some (as indicated in verses 8 and 11). Many languages have a similar idiom. A translation of verse 10 should not imply that Israel was completely blind. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])

(See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	48	10	u4zs	writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּשַּׁ֥ק	1	and he	“and Israel” or “and his father”. It may be helpful to read this sentence aloud in your translation to make sure the use of nouns and pronouns is natural and accurate in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])

GEN	48	10	fgg6		וַ⁠יְחַבֵּ֥ק לָ⁠הֶֽם	1	and embraced them.	“and hugged them.” Consider again how you translated the word “embraced” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 29:13; 33:4; 48:10. Also compare that to how you translated an idiom (“fell on...neck”) that has a similar meaning in Gen 33:4; 45:14, 46:29. It may be necessary to translate these terms in different ways, depending on the context.
GEN	48	11	g4x5	writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ אֶל יוֹסֵ֔ף	1	Then Israel said to Joseph,	“Then Israel exclaimed to Joseph,” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])

GEN	48	12	q0a0	writing-pronouns	מֵ⁠עִ֣ם בִּרְכָּ֑י⁠ו	1	from beside his knees	“from beside his father’s knees” or “from beside/near his father”. Joseph’s sons (who were in their 20s) were near Jacob’s knees, so that he could hug them; they were not sitting on his knees or lap. Also make sure it is clear that your translation of “his” refers to Jacob, not Joseph. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]])
GEN	48	12	hcdn		וַ⁠יִּשְׁתַּ֥חוּ	1	and he bowed down	“and he bowed {before him}” or “and he prostrated himself {before him}”

If necessary, you could make that information explicit in your translation or put it in a footnote. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])

He had Ephraim stand in front of Israel’s left {hand/side}, and he had Manasseh stand in front of Israel’s right {hand/side}.” Do what is best in your language.

He guided his hands,	“Then he {intentionally} {put/rested} his left hand on Manasseh’s head. He crossed his arms {to do that}” or “Then he crossed his arms and {put} his left hand on Manasseh’s head,” In the Hebrew culture, the right side was the place of highest honor and using the right hand to bless someone was symbolic of giving greater honor to that person. The oldest son was also the one who normally received the greater blessing. Israel reverses that here and gives Joseph’s younger son the greater blessing. It may be important to include a footnote in your translation that gives this information. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
GEN	48	14	c6bw		כִּ֥י	1	because	“{even} though” or “in spite of the fact that”. Make sure that the way you translate “because” fits with the fact that Israel wanted to place his right hand on Ephraim (to give him the greater blessing), even though Manasseh was the firstborn (who would normally receive the greater blessing in that culture).
GEN	48	14	xrxn		מְנַשֶּׁ֖ה הַ⁠בְּכֽוֹר	1	Manasseh {was} the firstborn.	“Manasseh {was} the/{Joseph’s} firstborn/oldest {son}.”

GEN	48	15	zf1u	figs-explicit	הָֽ⁠אֱלֹהִ֡ים	1	“May the God	“May {God bless your sons,} the God” or “I pray that {God will bless your sons,} the God” or “I ask God {to bless your sons}. He is the God”. For some languages it is better to break up the long sentence in verses 15-16 and to also make it explicit here that Israel is asking God to bless Joseph’s sons, rather than wait until verse 16. Do what is best in your language. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])

You may need to translate it differently in different contexts. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
GEN	48	15	hucn	figs-metaphor	הָֽ⁠אֱלֹהִים֙ הָ⁠רֹעֶ֣ה אֹתִ֔⁠י	1	the God who has been shepherding me	“the {same} God who has watched over me” or “He is the {same} God who has taken care of me”. The word “shepherded” includes guiding, protecting, and providing food and water, such as a shepherd would do for his sheep. Here it is used as a metaphor that refers to God’s complete care of Israel throughout his life. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to use a similar metaphor here. For example, you could say, “He is the {same} God who, for my entire life, has taken care of all my needs, just as a {good} shepherd takes care of his sheep.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

Also consider again how you translated “angel” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 16:7, 9-11; 19:1, 15; 21:17; 22:11, 15; 24:7, 40; 28:12; 31:11; 32:3, 6; 48:16.

GEN	48	16	yuap		יְבָרֵךְ֮ אֶת הַ⁠נְּעָרִים֒	1	bless {these} boys,	“cause {these} young men to prosper {greatly},” Since Joseph’s sons were probably in their 20s, make sure your translation of this phrase does not sound like they were little boys. The Hebrew word for “boy” here can also be translated as “lad, servant,” or “young man,” depending on the context and who is speaking to whom. With that in mind, consider again how you translated this word in the book of Genesis. See Gen 14:24; 18:7; 19:4; 21:12, 17-20; 22:3, 5, 12, 19; 25:27; 34:19; 37:2; 41:12; 43:8; 44:22, 30-34; 48:16.

This is more {land} than I am giving to your brothers.” Do what is best in your language. Also consider again how you translated “Amorite{s}” in the book of Genesis. See Gen 10:16; 14:7, 13; 15:16, 21; 48:22. (See: figs-infostructure}
