40:1-23 The Chief Cupbearer’s And Chief Baker’s Dreams

Gen 40:1 Then it happened after those things {that} the cupbearer of the king of Egypt and the baker sinned against their lord, against the king of Egypt.

Then it happened after those things {that}
“Sometime after that,” or “After some time, {one day}”

the cupbearer of the king of Egypt and the baker 
“the {chief/head} wine-server and the {chief/head} baker for the king of Egypt” or “the man {who was in charge of those} who served wine to the king of/over Egypt and the man {who was in charge of those} who made/baked bread/food {for the king}”. The chief cupbearer was one of Pharaoh’s most trusted servants. He was in charge of serving Pharaoh anything that he wanted to drink, especially wine. It was his job to test the drink before Pharaoh had some, to make sure it was high quality and not poisoned. Some of that information could be put in a footnote. Also, it may be more natural to include here in verse 1 the fact that these were the head officials in these jobs, rather than wait until verse 2 to introduce that. Do what is best in your language. (See: figs-explicit)

sinned against 
“disobeyed/displeased” or “offended”. The text does not say what the officials did wrong that angered Pharaoh. They may have done their jobs poorly in some way. Translate this phrase in a way that fits this context well in your language. (See: translate-key-terms)

their lord, against the king of Egypt.
“their master, {who was} {Pharaoh} the king of/over Egypt.” For some languages it is more natural to include here in verse 1 the fact that the king of Egypt was Pharaoh, rather than wait until verse 2 to introduce that. Do what is best in your language.


Gen 40:2 And Pharaoh broke out in anger against his two officials, against the chief of the cupbearers and against the chief of the bakers,

And Pharaoh 
“So Pharaoh/he” or “As a result, Pharaoh/he”. Make sure it is clear in your translation that Pharaoh (verse 2) is the same person as the king of Egypt (verse 1). See how you translated “Pharaoh” in Gen 12:15, and see the important note about this there. (See: translate-names)

broke out in anger against 
“was very angry at/with” or “was furious with”. Consider whether your language has an idiom similar to “broke out in anger” that fits well here. (See: figs-idiom)

his two officials, against the chief of the cupbearers and against the chief of the bakers, 
“the official in charge of serving wine to him and the official in charge of baking bread for him” or “his chief/head wine-server and chief/head baker” or “those two officials/officers.” It may be more natural to combine verses 1 and 2 and say, “Sometime after that, Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, became very angry at two of his officials, his chief wine-server and chief baker, because they had displeased him.” In this case, you would also combine the verse numbers (1-2) to show it is a verse bridge combining two verses. Do what is best in your language. (See: translate-versebridge)


Gen 40:3 and he put them in custody in the house of the chief of the guards, in the round-house, the place where Joseph was bound.

and he put them 
“So he had them {arrested and} put” or “So he {had his soldiers arrest them and} put them”. Often in the Bible (as here), when it says that a king (or someone else with authority) did something, it is implied that he had people who were under his authority actually do it. See how you translated a similar clause in Gen 39:20. (See: figs-explicit)

in custody
“under guard” or “in prison” 

in the house of the chief of the guards, 
“in/at the chief/captain of/over the guards’ house,” Apparently the round-house prison was part of the house where the chief of the guards lived and worked, perhaps a lower part (see Joseph’s use of the word “pit” in verse 15 to refer to this prison). See how you translated “chief/captain of the guards” in Gen 37:36 and 39:1.

in the round-house, the place where Joseph was bound. 
“{that is,} in the round-house {prison/jail}, the {same} place/prison where Joseph was imprisoned/confined.” or “in the same prison where Joseph was.” See how you translated “bound” in Gen 39:20.


Gen 40:4 And the chief of the guards assigned Joseph to them, so he attended them, and they were in custody {for} days.

And the chief of the guards 
“{There} the captain of/over the guards”

assigned Joseph to them, 
“assigned/appointed Joseph {to take care of them},”

so he attended them,
“so he served them,” or “and so he waited on them,”

and they were in custody 
“and they were {kept} in custody/prison” or “and they remained in custody/prison”. Some translations begin a new paragraph and sentence here that continues into verse 5 and say, “After they had been in prison {for} a while, 5 one night the king’s head wine-server and head baker dreamed...” (See: figs-infostructure)

{for} days.
“{for} some days/time,” or “{for} a while,” The phrase “{for} days” is a general expression that refers to an unspecified length of time.

Gen 40:5 Then the two of them dreamed a dream. Each {had} his {own} dream in the same night, each {man’s} dream had its own interpretation. {They were} the cupbearer and the baker who {belonged} to the king of Egypt, who were bound in the round-house.

Then the two of them dreamed a dream. Each {had} his {own} dream in the same night,
“Then one night the two of them each had a dream,” or “One night they both/each had a dream” (See: figs-infostructure)

each {man’s} dream had its own interpretation.
“{and} each of the dreams had its own interpretation/meaning.” or “each with its own interpretation/meaning.” or “Each {one’s} dream had its own meaning.” Consider whether or not it is best in your language to begin a new sentence here.

{They were} the cupbearer and the baker who {belonged} to the king of Egypt, who were bound in the round-house.
“{This is talking about} the wine-server and the baker, who had served the king of Egypt and/but were in prison.” Many translations leave this sentence implied because it repeats information from the previous verses and may sound too repetitive. Or you could put this sentence earlier in this verse and say, “Then one night, the king of Egypt’s wine server and baker each had a dream while they were in prison, and each {man’s/one’s} dream had its own interpretation/meaning.” Make sure it is clear in your translation that the cupbearer and baker in verse 5 are the same officials as those in verses 2-4. (See: figs-infostructure)


Gen 40:6 And Joseph came to them in the morning and saw them, and behold, they were upset.

And Joseph came to them in the morning and 
“In the morning, Joseph came to {serve} them and” or “The next morning, when Joseph came to {serve} them, he”. Consider whether or not it is more natural in your language to have the time phrase “in the morning” first this verse. (See: figs-infostructure)

saw them, and behold, 
“saw/noticed that” or “was surprised to see that”

they were upset. 
“they were troubled.” or “they looked distressed/sad.”
 

Gen 40:7 So he asked Pharaoh’s officials who {were} with him in custody {in} the house of his master, saying, “Why {are} your faces sad today?”

So he asked Pharaoh’s officials who {were} with him in custody {in} the house of his master, saying, 
“So/And he asked Pharaoh’s officials/officers who {were} in prison with him in his master’s house,” or “So/And he asked them,” (See: writing-pronouns)

“Why {are} your faces sad today?”
“Why do your faces look so sad/downcast today?” or “Why do you look {so} sad/unhappy today?”
Some languages have an idiom that fits well here. Do what is natural in your language.


Gen 40:8 And they said to him, “We dreamed a dream, but {there is} no one to interpret it.” Then Joseph said to them, “Don’t interpretations {belong} to God? Please tell {them} to me.”

And they said to him, 
“They answered him,” or “They replied,” (See: writing-quotations)

“We dreamed a dream, 
“We {each} had a dream {last night},” or “{Last night} we {both/each} had a dream,”

but {there is} no one to interpret it.” 
“but there is no one {here} who can tell {us} what our dreams mean.” or “but we do not have anyone {here} to interpret/explain them {for us}.”

Then Joseph said to them, 
“Then/So Joseph replied,” or “Joseph replied,” (See: writing-quotations)

“Don’t interpretations {belong} to God?
“God is the {only} one who can explain the meaning {of dreams}.” or “God is the {only} one who gives someone/people the ability to interpret {the meaning of dreams}.” Joseph uses this rhetorical question to emphasize that God is the only one who interprets dreams. Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language. (See: figs-rquestion)

Please tell {them} to me.”
“Please tell me {what you dreamed}.” or “Please tell/describe {your dreams} to me {and God will reveal to me what they mean}.” Make sure that your translation of the last two sentences in this verse does not sound like Joseph is claiming to be God. Rather, he is saying that if the two officials tell their dreams to him, God will enable him to interpret the dreams. (See: figs-explicit)

Gen 40:9 Then the chief of the cupbearers told his dream to Joseph and said to him, “And behold, in my dream a grapevine {was} before me,

“told Joseph what was in his dream” or “related/described to Joseph what he had seen in his dream”

and said to him, 
“by saying,” or “He said,” or “This is what he said:”

“And behold, in my dream a grapevine {was}
“In my dream there was a grapevine/vine” or “While I was dreaming, I saw a grapevine/vine”. If grapevines and grapes are not known in your area, you could be more general in verses 9-11 and say “vine” and “fruit”. See how you translated “vineyard” in Gen 9:20.

before me, 
“in front of me”


Gen 40:10 and on the grapevine {were} three branches. Then while it was budding, its blossoms came out, {and} its clusters ripened {into} grapes.

and on the grapevine {were} three branches. 
“The grapevine/vine had three branches.” or “that had three branches.” Consider whether or not it is more natural to begin a new sentence here in your language.

Then while it was budding, 
“As soon as it started budding,” or “Soon buds started forming {on the vine/branches}, {then}”

its blossoms came out, 
“{suddenly} there were blossoms/flowers,” or “{the buds} became blossoms/flowers,”

{and} its clusters ripened {into} grapes.
“{and} its/the clusters {of flowers} became {clusters/bunches of} ripe grapes/fruit.” or “{and the blossoms/flowers} became clusters/bunches of ripe grapes/fruit.” 


Gen 40:11 Then the cup of Pharaoh {was} in my hand and I took the grapes and squeezed them into the cup of Pharaoh. Then I put the cup into the hand of Pharaoh.”

Then the cup of Pharaoh {was} in my hand 
“Then/Next {I saw that} I was holding *{King} Pharaoh’s cup,” or “...holding the king’s cup,”

and I took the grapes 
“and/so I picked {some} grapes/fruit {from the vine}”

and squeezed them 
“and squeezed juice from them” or “and squeezed them {so that the juice went/flowed}”
 
into the cup of Pharaoh.
“into Pharaoh’s cup.” or “into the cup.”

Then I put the cup into the hand of Pharaoh.”
“Then I put the cup into Pharaoh’s hand {to drink from}.” or “Then I gave/handed the cup to Pharaoh {and he drank from it}.” (See: figs-explicit)

Gen 40:12 Then Joseph said to him, “This {is} its interpretation: The three branches {are} three days.

Then Joseph said to him, 
“Joseph said to him,” or “Then Joseph told him,”

“This {is} its interpretation: 
“This is the interpretation/meaning of your dream:” or “This/Here {is} what your dream means:”

The three branches {are} three days. 
“The three branches {represent/symbolize} three days.”


Gen 40:13 Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position, and you will put Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, according to the former custom when you were his cupbearer. 

Within three days 
“In three {more} days” or “Three days from now”

Pharaoh will lift up your head 
“Pharaoh will summon you” or “Pharaoh will have you brought up {out of prison}”. The idiom “lift up your head” means that the wine-server will be summoned or brought out from the lowly or shameful place where he had been staying. (See: figs-idiom)

and restore you to your position, 
“and reappoint/reinstate/return you to your {previous} position/work,” or “and give you back your job/status,” 

and you will 
“so that you will {again}”

put Pharaoh’s cup into his hand,
“serve wine to Pharaoh,” or “have the duty of serving Pharaoh his cup of wine,”

according to the former custom when you were his cupbearer.
“as you used to do when you were his cupbearer/wine-server.” or “the way you did before as his cupbearer/wine-server.”


Gen 40:14 But if you remember me with you, when it goes well for you, then please show kindness to me and mention me to Pharaoh and get me out from this house. 

But if you remember me with you, when it goes well for you, 
“When {you are out of prison and} everything is going well for you, remember that I was {here} with you,” or “Also, when {you get out of prison and} your life is good, remember {how well} I served/treated you,”

then please show kindness to me 
“and please be kind/gracious to me” or “and please do me a favor”. See how you translated “showed kindness to” in Gen 39:21. It may be necessary to translate this phrase in different ways, depending on the context.

and mention me to Pharaoh 
“and mention my situation to Pharaoh” or “and tell Pharaoh about me {and how I was falsely accused}”

and get me out from this house.
“so that I can get out of this prison.” or “so that he releases/frees me from this prison.”


Gen 40:15 For indeed I was stolen from the land of the Hebrews. And also here I did not do anything that they should put me in the pit.”

For indeed I was stolen 
“Surely I was taken by force” or “People brought me {here} by force”. Consider the best way to translate this passive clause in your language to emphasize Joseph. (See: figs-activepassive)

from the land of the Hebrews. 
“from the land where the Hebrew people live.” or “from the land where {my people} the Hebrews live.” The Hebrew people were the descendants of Abraham (see note at Gen 14:13), and Joseph’s people were known as “Hebrews” in Egypt (Gen 39:14, 17). Their land, which God gave them, was the land of Canaan (Gen 13:12, 14-15; 17:8, 23:19; 37:1). Some of that information could be put in a footnote.

And also here 
“And {while I have been} here {in Egypt},” or “Even here {in Egypt}” (See: figs-explicit)

I did not do anything
“I have not done anything {wrong}” or “I have done nothing {wrong}”

“to be put/thrown into this dungeon/prison.” or “to deserve being in a dungeon/prison.”

“When the head baker heard Joseph interpret/explain that dream in a favorable/positive way,” or “When the head baker heard the positive interpretation/meaning that Joseph gave {for the first dream},” See how you translated a related word (“interpreter”) in verse 8.

“I also had a dream, and in it” or “I also {had a dream}, and while I was dreaming,”

behold, {there were} 
“I saw” or “there were”

three baskets of white bread
The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It can mean (1) “three baskets {full} of white/fine bread/cakes” or “three bread baskets” (2) “three white/wicker baskets”. These baskets were open on top and were probably woven out of flexible strips of cane or willow branches.

“{stacked} {on top of each other} on my head.” These baskets would have been carried on the head, each one above the other.


Gen 40:17 And in the top basket {were} all {kinds} of food for Pharaoh, baker’s goods, but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.”

And in the top basket {were} 
“In the top basket {there were}” or “The top basket {was full of}”

Gen 40:19 Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head from on you and hang you on a tree, and the birds will eat your flesh from on you.”

Within three days 
“In three days” or “Three days from now”. See how you translated this phrase in verse 13.

Pharaoh will lift up your head from on you 
“Pharaoh will {have his soldiers} cut/chop off your head” or “Pharaoh will have you beheaded”. Here, the phrase “lift up your head from on you” seems to have a literal meaning (of having the baker beheaded) in contrast to the figurative meaning of “lift up your head” in verse 13 (where it means to summon from a lowly or shameful place). Make sure your translation of this phrase is accurate and clear in both contexts.

and hang you on a tree,
“and hang your body on a tree/stake,” or “and impale your body on a {sharp} pole,”

and the birds 
“and/where birds/vultures”. These were birds such as vultures, buzzards or condors that eat carrion (dead animals); these were not birds that eat seeds or hunt live prey. You could use the name of a type of bird that is well-known in your language area.

“will eat/devour {all} your flesh off your bones.” See how you translated “eating” in verse 17.

Gen 40:20 Then it happened on the third day, the day Pharaoh was born, that he made a feast for all his servants. And he lifted up the head of the chief of the cupbearers and the head of the chief of the bakers in the presence of his servants.

Then it happened on the third day, the day Pharaoh was born, that
“Then sure enough, three days later {it was} {King} Pharaoh’s birthday, and” or “And it so happened that three days later, {it was} Pharaoh’s birthday, and”. The phrase “Then it happened” introduces and emphasizes a set of important events. Do what is natural in your language.

he made a feast for all his servants. 
“he held a feast/banquet for all of his officials/officers {to attend}.” or “he invited all his officials/officers to attend a/his {birthday} feast/banquet.” See how you translated “feast” or “banquet” in Gen 21:8.

And he lifted up the head of the chief of the cupbearers and the head of the chief of the bakers 
“{During the feast/banquet,} he {had soldiers} bring {his} head/chief wine-server and head/chief baker {out of prison} {to the feast/banquet}”.

Do what is natural in your language. See how you translated “hang...on a tree” in verse 19.
